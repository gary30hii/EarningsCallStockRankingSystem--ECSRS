At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to the Trade Desk fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our Web site at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations are subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found on our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provide a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. I will turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Hello, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2020 was a uniquely challenging year from a variety of dimensions. At the same time, however, 2020 also represented an inflection point for our company. It was a year that advertisers became more deliberate with every advertising dollar shifting spend towards the open Internet. There were a lot of drivers of change in 2020, which included an unprecedented global pandemic, the rise of social justice issues, a divisive election in the United States and stronger economic pressures and higher levels of uncertainty weighing on nearly all of the consumers in the world. These drivers of change have already manifested themselves for marketers, whether it's the accelerated shift to CTV or the demand for better cross-device measurement and ROI, or brands and advertisers reassessing the value of user-generated content in their now more deliberate marketing plans. I want to spend a few minutes today explaining what the 2020 inflection point means for our company and our industry moving forward. 2020 was a year that the world had more uncertainty and more change than usual. While at TTD, like the rest of the world, we'd like to get back to a world that is a little more predictable and feels a bit more like what we called normal in 2019. So much happened in 2020, both inside and outside of our company that better positions the Trade Desk for a bigger and brighter future. So I need to give you my perspective on what happened in 2020 to show why I believe we're so well positioned in 2021 and beyond, as the digital advertising market matures and more marketers gravitate to the open Internet. Let me start with the highlight numbers. Spend on our platform in 2020 was nearly $4.2 billion, a record. Fourth quarter spend alone was over $1.6 billion, also a record. CTV spend more than doubled for the year. And once again, despite all the uncertainty of the year, we delivered strong profitability highlighting the operating leverage we have in our business. We often benchmark our results against the Rule of 40 of other high-growth companies of our size, where the health of a technology company is expressed as the sum of a company's growth rate and EBITDA margin. 40% is healthy. In 2020, we finished at over 60%, all while we are investing in our future as fast as we can. According to eMarketer, our total global ad spending declined 4.5% last year. Meanwhile, spend on our platform grew 34%. Even amid the uncertainty of 2020, where all marketers reevaluated their ad campaigns in some way, shape or form, they continued to shift, spend and invest in ad opportunities that are dynamic and measurable. We were able to drive this performance and take so much share, even as some of the verticals we serve such as travel, auto, entertainment and real estate continued to be in a state of flux. They have all yet to fully recover. Obviously, we benefited from the surge in political advertising last year, which represented a high single-digit contribution to our growth in the fourth quarter. And by the way, we're very proud of the work we did in political last year, especially our role in representing a better process for all political candidates. As many companies agonize over the role they should play, we were clear from the outset. We are an objective and independent platform open to register candidates on all sides. I continue to believe that the data-driven advertising has an important role to play in the political arena. On a platform such as ours, candidates are more likely to focus on the substantive issues that voters care about, leveraging premium inventory versus the divisive that user-generated content often found on some social media platforms and some UGC video platforms. But even as we point out the political advertising surge we saw in 2020, political tilled a hole for Trade Desk that was left by other advertisers and other important verticals that have not yet returned to their pre-pandemic levels. We expect them to improve through this year, hopefully. We start to return to some sense of normal. More broadly, I fully expect that the trends we saw in 2020 continue to accelerate in the years ahead as advertisers increasingly gravitate to our platform. To give you a sense of these trends and why I'm so optimistic, I want to cover three main areas. First, I'd like to take a look at TV and how 2020 was a turning point for many marketers and their massive TV ad campaigns. What's happening in TV is not limited to that channel, it's driving change across the ad ecosystem. Second, it's important to focus for a minute on the future of relevant advertising and in particular, how the industry is thinking about identity. And third, and finally, I want to summarize how these factors, among others, are critical as the ad industry starts to gravitate toward the open Internet, a trend that I expect to accelerate in years ahead. So first, the changing nature of TV. We've talked a lot over the last 12 months about how the pandemic accelerated trends that were already underway, but we couldn't have predicted quite how sharp that acceleration would be. With most consumers working from home, not surprisingly, more and more of them are shifting from cable to streaming TV. The on-demand nature of streaming makes for a better experience. However, the new economic pressure is weighing on the average consumer are also forcing an even bigger change. Whether you look at our numbers or MAGNA Global's or eMarketer\u2019s, the trend is undeniable. We are right around that point where there are more U.S. households without a cable subscription than those with one, and that trend is not reversing. Dig a little deeper and you'll find that younger generations, the 18 to 34-year olds, highly coveted by many advertisers have even less interest in cable. And if you look beyond the U.S. at Asia, for example, you'll see in many markets that the notion of a big screen in the living room is less conventional. In Asia, premium video is often consumed on a mobile device. But perhaps more important than all that data is, where we go from here, because 2020 was a wake up call to the advertising industry, when it came to TV. I can't put it any better than Mark Pritchard did, the Chief Brand Officer of P&G, the world's largest advertiser. I was on stage with him at CES a few weeks ago, virtually, of course, and he talked about how 2020 has forced advertisers into a world of ''constructive disruption''. He highlighted the upfront process, which he described as a hold over from the 1950s where TV ad campaigns were tied to new vehicle launches every year \u2013 every fall. He talked about the need to be more flexible, more real-time to bring the same measurement techniques we've grown accustomed to in digital to the world of TV. Ultimately, he and I believe we are heading toward an inevitable future, where all of advertising is, and I quote using his words, digital, programmatic, data-driven and automatic. By the way, he's not alone in this thinking about the upfronts. According to our research, 60% of linear TV ad buyers are planning to spend less at the upfront this year for these very same reasons. One of them, the Head of TV ad buying at a global life sciences company told us that, '' traditional upfront media buying is the most disconnected area of media and business today''. And it's not just advertisers who are thinking differently, the content providers are too. And on that same stage, Linda Yaccarino of NBC, talked about how CTV has freed the network of the, \u201chandcuffs of legacy stuff\u201d, that was preventing them from delivering on the new data-driven needs of their advertisers. It's liberating for the entire market, and that's one reason why CTV stood out in a year when across the industry overall ad spending was down. CTV was the strongest growth segment of the global ad market last year and the fastest growing channel on our platforms as well, and that's because advertisers see their customers moving to streaming platforms and they are learning that CTV offers a new kind of value. Advertisers can apply data to drive more precision and localized targeting than linear. They can measure performance in real time across platforms. They can pivot campaigns quickly based on performance feedback and they can experiment with new formats. In a year when brands are challenged to adopt messaging, often on a highly local basis based on rapidly changing circumstances, all of these factors become compelling. Take a large US automotive research and e-commerce brand that needs to navigate the uncertainty of 2020 and in particular, the economic fallout on their business because of the pandemic. This company needed more flexibility and agility. Throughout the year, they pulled as many dollars as they could out from their existing underperforming upfront contracts and linear budgets and move those dollars to CTV on our platform. With their agency, they chose The Trade Desk platform for two main reasons; one was the ability to apply data-driven decisioning and measurement in real-time in order to adapt to the rapidly changing market conditions; the second was to access premium inventory at scale in specific local markets on networks such as NBC and Discovery. This is not an isolated case. In fact, in 2020, more than 1,000 brands spent at least $100,000 on CTV on our platform. Those brands spending more than $1 million on our platform in 2020, more than doubled from a year ago. When you factor in that CTV now has the scale to provide an alternative to the divisive user generated content that often populates big social and video platforms, you can see why CTV was the largest growth segment of the global advertising market last year. But let me take this one step further. Until 2020, TV was the last bastion of analog advertising. At the same time, it is also the largest segment of the advertising pie. Marketers know that video is the best channel to win the hearts and minds of consumers. TV is where marketers spend the most money and is often where the most creative talent resides within a brand. It's also where the power centers of an agency typically reside. The market opportunity here is significant. Eventually, all TV advertising will be digital and programmatic. In fact, I believe premium video, in all of its form, including CTV, will be half of the $1 trillion advertising market in the not too distant future. CTV is a Trojan horse for the acceleration of programmatic across the ad industry, and we're starting to see that play out now. Which brings me to my second topic, the future of relevant advertising and how the industry is coming together to forge a new path for identity. This is not simply a question of updating you about UID 2.0. I'll get to that. But before I do, I'm not sure we've been clear enough about a key point. Right now, many people are debating what identity solution has the best chance of replacing third party cookies. But I feel like we're having the wrong conversation. Instead, we should be focused on the question of how to make the open Internet a symphony that maximizes the talents of every orchestra member, playing together, rather than looking for a single solution, the most impressive work is done by those of us making solutions interoperable, creating a currency that can be used by all reputable players and upgrading all the weaknesses of cookies. UID 2.0 is the new common currency of the open Internet, one that respects privacy and improves consumer controls, while preserving the value exchange of relevant advertising. UID 2.0 is also free. And as we speak, it is being integrated into the transactional pipes of the entire open Internet. And that common currency is not just centered on if this new currency allows for effective comparison and measurability across all advertising channels across the open Internet. Ultimately, that's what advertisers care about most. If you were to ask most of them, they'd probably say they expect the identity piece to get fixed and they expect the key industry players, such as The Trade Desk, to figure that out for them. What advertisers really want is a trusted system that solves the identity problem while also solving for the measurement opportunity. And if we get that right, once again, we prove out the value of the open Internet versus the limitations of walled gardens, where measurement is typically some variation of grading your own homework. And it's also why I'm so excited about the progress the industry has made with Unified ID 2.0. Pretty much the entire ad tech ecosystem has signed on. Among SSPs, Index Exchange, Magnite, PubMatic, OpenX and SpotX are all on board. Criteo has become a great partner. Like us, they're all in on UID 2.0. Among data connectivity companies, LiveRamp and Neustar are integrating UID. Publishers such as Mediavine and Fubo TV are now part of the UID community, along with The Washington Post and their Zeus Technology platform that powers over 100 other media publishers, including some of the leading daily newspapers in the United States. Those are just the ones we've announced. There are many others that we're working with actively, including publishers, advertisers, partners, large media companies, data companies and even other DSPs. But perhaps most telling about the future common currency of the Internet is the work we're doing with Nielsen. As you know, Nielsen is the gold standard in media measurement, especially for TV. But as the media world becomes more fragmented and more digital, they are overhauling their technology to stay at the bleeding edge. And Unified ID 2.0 will be a core element of that new offering. Why? Because like us, Nielsen believes that UID 2.0 will become the new common currency of the open Internet. They understand what an upgrade this represents to cookies. In addition to the wide ranging industry support for Unified ID 2.0, there's also been a lot of progress around independent governance. As we have said from the beginning, an identity solution is much bigger than any one company, including The Trade Desk. As you may have seen, UID 2.0 has been submitted to the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media, or PRAM, for further community development and management. PRAM comprises the biggest advertising brands, the major agencies and the leading ad tech players in the world. PRAM was designed to oversee the administration of new identity tools that advance the open Internet, such as UID. Governance of UID will ultimately be federated. And Prebid, an industry organization committed to transparency and fairness in header bidding, has already signed on to be one of the governing organizations of UID. What's also been very interesting about the evolution of UID 2.0 is not just the enthusiasm in the United States but also demand to understand its application around the world. And to understand the importance of the interest worldwide, you need to appreciate how various privacy and consumer protection regulations have come into force around the world. Take GDPR in Europe, for example. GDPR was an important initiative to craft new legislation to protect consumers as the Internet started to reach into every aspect of our lives. At its core, GDPR, like a great deal of privacy regulation we see around the world, is based on important philosophical principles. But it's not necessarily prescriptive. It's up to market participants to interpret GDPR and figure out what to do. Without prescription and without case law, everyone is working on solutions that meet requirements and building that important body of use cases. In my view, Unified ID 2.0 comes closest to meeting the evolving philosophical principles that we see getting legislated around the world, including in Europe. Not simply because it's highly secure and it moves control to the consumers' hands, but also because Unified ID solves for the other key aspect of becoming a common currency of digital advertising. Unified ID 2.0 also allows for cross channel measurement across the entire open Internet. I am very deliberately focused on CTV and identity so far because they are transformative and how we think about the value of the open Internet versus the smaller, less competitive Internet that is primarily run inside of walled gardens, which is the third main point I want to make with you this afternoon. Until now, when we think about every new dollar that goes into digital advertising, we think about that dollar going into a Facebook or a Google first. Because these platforms are easy, there's easy access to scale. The open Internet has traditionally received the leftovers, but that dynamic is starting to change. At end state, the first dollar goes to the open Internet. So why am I so optimistic about this? Because in 2020, we started to see the signs of the tide turning. As it continues, this won't happen overnight. It's going to take years, but it is starting to happen. You only have to listen to Marc Pritchard and thousands of other major brand marketers who we interact with every day, hear them talk about the importance of being deliberate, data driven and measurable across multiple platforms and channels. That can really only happen on the open Internet. Walled gardens are not the easy on-ramp for CTV. In fact, they often don't have access to the premium content most valued by marketers. And often, targeting is limited and results are too. Relatedly, let's consider what happened in UGC in 2020. Last year, brands became more aware than ever that their ads may be showing up against questionable use of generated content and the device and viral discussions that UGC content can sometimes incite. Advertisers want an alternative. And in 2020, they started to look at CTV as the scalable brand safe platform that gets them the same reach with better performance measurement. UID adoptions are even better than expected. Publishers, brands, suppliers, data companies, partners and even competitors, everyone wants the open Internet to operate with the highest level of privacy and consumer controls, while also preserving the value exchange of relevant advertising through cross channel measurement. UID cracks the code on that and it's inspiring to see the industry rally around a solution bigger than any one company. Now UID won't exist in isolation. In fact, I would argue that there will be a handful of other identity technologies in the market. That's okay. It's even good because the focus is on interoperability. But perhaps nothing highlights this shift more than the news we announced a few weeks ago around our new partnership with Walmart. The work we're doing with Walmart is actually indicative of an entire industry that is starting to shift to a data-first marketing model. This is significant for our business because, according to some estimates, the TAM for shopper marketing is well over $100 billion. Let me use Walmart to explain. Walmart is the world's largest retailer after all, with the world's largest supply of shopper data, across a massive array of consumer products. And for the first time with this partnership, they are making that shopper data available to advertisers. So Walmart suppliers, who happen to be among the world's leading advertisers, can now run digital ads, whether on mobile, desktop, CTV, audio, et cetera, and understand how shoppers are reacting to those apps. By that, I mean which ones led to sales and when. And advertisers can then refine those ad campaigns based on which ones work best with which kind of customers, at what times and what channels and what regions and near which stores. For consumer packaged goods companies, this is something of a holy grail. They can adapt campaigns on the fly based on the data they get back on shopper reactions. So the advertising process becomes more refined, more effective and more valuable. This is especially true in Walmart's case because not only are they a fast growing online retailer, but Walmart is also the largest brick and mortar retailer in the world. The integrated approach to data and measurement will apply to both aspects of their business. If you're a major CPG company, you may have many products such as Tide laundry detergent or a Hershey chocolate bar that are still sold primarily in the store. So this integrated approach is critical. Because we are talking about some of the most valuable shopper data in the world, Walmart wants to make sure that data is managed securely with all the appropriate consumer privacy controls. They could have built their own platform, which makes us even more honored that we have forged a partnership and are leveraging our scale together. Instead, they are focused on the combination of Walmart shopper data and the technology and performance of The Trade Desk platform. Not only does our platform provide the data controls Walmart demands, they know we are an independent and objective company and they know their supplier clients already work with us and trust us. And as I said, it's not just Walmart that's driving this shift in the retail industry, most major retailers recognize the value and power of their shopper data. Those retailers are also working with us to liberate data so their suppliers can market more effectively in a secure privacy safe way. The go to market approach for each retailer may be slightly different, but the common thread is that these retailers understand that the only way to realize the full value of their data is on the open Internet. There's no point building walls around it. Brands will, over time, always gravitate to the places where they can be deliberate and where they can measure ad impressions across channels. I'd like to wrap this up by tying these all together. As I said, marketers are driving a game changing revolution in TV advertising based on conviction that they need to be more data driven, more deliberate and more measurable. Partly driven by the shift in TV advertising, major brands are now talking about the future being data driven and programmatic across all channels. I hear it from every customer I talk to across all industries. That new data driven focus is also driving momentum around new identity solutions that not only boost consumer privacy, but also become a common currency that is key to cross channel measurement. And you can see this playing out as companies such as Walmart and the retail industry more broadly are standardizing on The Trade Desk as they overhaul their digital marketing business. It all points to the growing primacy of the open Internet and that's where we win. As this shift accelerates in the years ahead, and it will, we have the opportunity to become the de facto demand side platform for the open Internet. I am confident about our future. Now everything won't happen overnight or in one quarter, of course, but we've spent 10 years getting ready for this opportunity. It's why we continue to invest in our platform with the biggest product launch in our history coming later this year, which is all centered on helping our clients drive value from their data across advertising channels. It's why we continue to focus so aggressively on international growth. This is a global shift. And I'm very excited that our international growth is now outpacing our North America growth. That's a very positive sign that we are investing in the right way in the right places. And it's why we continue to work hard to drive the industry forward with initiatives such as Unified ID 2.0. This work is critical to build trust as the shift to the open Internet unfolds. It raises all boats, including ours. Our focus allows us to continue to exceed our expectations. As I said at the outset, 2020 was a very challenging year but it was also a transformative one for us and our industry. I could not be more excited about building on our progress in 2021. With that, let me hand it over to Blake to cover the financials.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we finished 2020 incredibly strong, capping off a solid year for our business despite the challenges faced around the world. Q4 revenue was $320 million, a 48% increase from a year ago. For full year 2020, revenue was $836 million, a 26% increase from a year ago. We have been encouraged to see advertisers accelerate their shift to data driven advertising in the second-half of 2020. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the value that The Trade Desk provides to thousands of agencies and brands as they work to connect with their customers across our platform every day. With the strong top line performance in Q4, we generated $153 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 48% of revenue. As you have seen historically, when we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, which it did again in Q4. EBITDA continues to benefit from temporarily lower than expected operating expense growth, partly driven by the impacts related to COVID-19. Even recognizing that, I am proud of our continued ability to substantially grow our top line revenue, while also producing meaningfully positive EBITDA. From the channel perspective, video, which includes CTV, led our growth in Q4, followed by audio, mobile and display, which all grew in the double digits on a year-over-year basis. As Jeff had mentioned, connected TV continued to be our fastest growing channel. Geographically in Q4, similar to last quarter, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. All of our major regions, North America, APAC and Europe, grew spend well into the double digits again year-over-year in Q4. One anecdote we're excited about are early indicators of acceleration in Europe. Gross spend growth in Europe accelerated every month in Q4. And for the full quarter, actually grew faster than North America after excluding spend associated with the US Presidential election. It is still early days for us internationally, but we continue to expand our leadership team and are optimistic about our trends there. In terms of our verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly every category improved during the quarter; health and fitness, our largest vertical in 2020; shopping, which benefited from the holiday season; food and drink and home garden all performed very well. Automotive was also particularly encouraging as it bounced back quite a bit in Q4 versus the prior quarter. Travel continues to stand out in terms of delayed recovery. And while it improved slightly from Q3, it still has a lot of room for growth that we expect will follow as the world returns to normal, whenever that happens. And finally, as you can imagine, we had strong US political spend during the quarter. In Q4, political spend represented a high single digit percent share of our spend. For the full year 2020, political spend represented a mid-single digit percent share of our spend. And importantly, this impact was felt beyond just the second-half of the year. For example, the democratic primary races drove solid spend for us in Q1 as the month of February, in particular, was one of our stronger political spend months during the year. Operating expenses were $213 million in Q4, up 31% year-over-year. I would like to remind you that due to the virtual environment, our operating expense growth continues to benefit from lower than normal employee support costs, including travel and corporate events, which are running significantly lower than the prior year. Income tax was a benefit of $45 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $185 million or $3.71 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was a record $168 million for Q4 and free cash flow was $149 million. The primary drivers were the increase in net income as well as a number of efficiencies gained in working capital, some that occurred throughout the year, including improvement in collections activity, better alignment of payables to receivables and shorter payment terms, primarily due to the political advertising environment. DSOs exiting the quarter were 121 days, up three days from a year ago. DPOs were 101 days, up seven days from a year ago. We exited Q4 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $624 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at the end of the quarter. In early October, we paid off the remaining $72 million of our revolving line of credit that we drew down in the very early days of COVID-19 out of an abundance of caution. At the end of the quarter, we had no revolver debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. During the first month and a half, spend is strong, and we're off to a great start to the year. We estimate Q1 revenue to be between $214 million and $217 million, which would represent growth of between 33% to 35% on a year-over-year basis, a modest acceleration from our Q1 results in 2020. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at least $55 million in Q1. I would remind you that the relative strength in our EBITDA forecast is in part due to the virtual environment our teams are working in. As we think about the full year, we are modeling for an improving digital advertising environment and expect a reasonable acceleration in our revenue growth. That said, our business still continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has significantly affected our advertisers and their demand for advertising. In addition, and this is important as you think about your models, we face relatively easier comps in the first-half of 2021, especially in Q2 and then comped stronger performance in the second-half of the year, in particular Q4, where we significantly benefited from US political ad spend. I want to say a few words about our expected operating expenses. Starting late in Q1 of 2020, we reduced the pace of our spending due to the uncertain operating environment. As we saw demand begin to return in May, we strategically started to increase the pace of our investments. While we have made some progress, as we think about 2021, we do expect to continue to increase our investments over the course of the year as we continue to invest in the long term growth of the business. We expect 2021 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be similar to what we incurred in 2020. We do expect data center and infrastructure spend to represent a larger share of our expenditures relative to office facilities compared to the prior year. Share count is expected to be about 52 million as we exit 2021. In summary, Q4 represented a strong finish to 2020. I cannot say enough about how well the team is focusing on helping our customers, spinning the flywheel and staying mindful of efficiency while driving material spend on our platform while we invest in and scale our business. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Michael Levine. Your line is live.\nMichaelLevine: Thanks for the opportunity, guys, and congrats on the strong finish to the year. A lot of the other digital advertising peers, I know a big part of the question and answers were directed around IDFA. So I mean, I think it's exciting that you called around Unified ID 2.0, but I guess I'd be curious your $0.02 on how, just as you're thinking about the slope of the year and ways that you guys feel like you can work around it. I'd love to hear your latest thoughts on IDFA?\nJeffGreen: Yes. Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the compliment as well as the question. So at times when I've answered this question in the past, I've perhaps given too much color on both the micro and the macro. And let me just talk specifically this time about how it affects us, The Trade Desk. So about 10% of our spend uses IDFA. That's meaningfully different than most other digital companies who are spending a lot of time talking about this. We also are a demand-side platform. We are not a publisher. We are not a destination, if you will, where you're logging on to our app or our website. So by being a demand-side platform, what we do is we look at about 12 million ad opportunities every single second. And so if a million of those, ish, have an identifier missing, so in other words, you take away IDFA, we still have 11 million to choose from. So we just choose from those that are left, the 11 million that are left. So even the 10% that has the IDFA on it today, we've just found some amount of signal to make it worth buying, but it's already something that we sort of steer away from, which is why it's not that much of our business. Which is why I can say definitively, I don't believe this will have any material impact on our business the way that it affects others. And I just want to put a finer point on it and just dispel the myth. Unlike a platform or a destination like a Pinterest or a Snapchat, where you have to monetize every ad on your site when a visitor comes there, you have to monetize it. If that's attached to an IDFA phone, for instance, or an Apple phone, then you still have to find a way to monetize it and you're going to monetize it at a discount. Those are the very same ads that we, on the demand side, are passing over. So because of the fact that we are on the demand side, that's why we're not impacted the way that those others are. It's not a difference of opinion, it's a difference of location in the supply chain.\nMichael Levine: Great. Thank you so much for the color.\nJeff Green: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Shyam Patil. Your line is live.\nShyamPatil: Thank you. Congrats on the great year and the outlook, guys. I had a couple of questions. I know that you said that political was in the high single digits in 4Q and mid single digits for the year. And when I look at 1Q guide, it seems like on an apples-to-apples basis, you're actually seeing accelerating growth. I'm just wondering, is that \u2013 is my math correct there? And just would love any color on that? And then second question, Blake, thanks for the high-level commentary on 2021. I was just wondering if it's possible to maybe put a finer point on how you guys are thinking about the year from a top line perspective as well as from an OpEx and investment perspective? Thank you.\nBlakeGrayson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Shyam. So I'll try to address them all here. So your math is correct. And so let me just try to walk through it. So 2020 accelerated trends that set us up pretty nicely for 2021 and beyond. But to your point, it's going to be a unique year in terms of comps on the quarters. And so, like I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we'll have an easier comp in the first-half of the year, especially Q2 and then we'll be comping stronger performance in the second-half of the year, especially Q4 because of that strong political spend that you mentioned. So as you think about moving from Q4 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021, it is really important to think about the political impact and strip that out if you're trying to do a sequential year-over-year comparison. So if you strip out the high single-digit percent spend in Q4 of 2020 and then you strip out from Q1 of 2020, that kind of mid-single, which we had referenced for the full-year, you will see that our Q1 guide actually shows acceleration from Q4, excluding political, which is a pretty good setup for us. And there's a lot of -- and then getting to your question about the full-year, there's a lot of positive trends, and Jeff can also add color at the end here regarding those that we're seeing. The obvious one is this continued shift to digital advertising and this just trend -- there's no trend really larger than this move to CTV. We're seeing verticals recovering with room still to grow in many of them. We have the kind of the UID momentum. We have the partnerships\u2019 momentum around things, places like Walmart and others that the team are working on. And we also have all the tools and the continuous platform updates associated with things like Solamar. So when you take all those things into account from a top line perspective, it's a pretty strong fundamental business. Just to repeat, we do see a reasonable acceleration for the full-year. And I\u2019m really comfortable about our business and our setup for 2021. With regards to the OpEx component, a reminder that 2020 is a unique year in that in - late in the first quarter, we reduced our pace of investments. As we saw demand return kind of back in late Q2, we started to ramp that up. And then you also have to keep in mind the 2020 expenses were impacted by COVID related to like travel and events and support and things like that. So as I \u2013 as we think about 2021, we do expect to continue to increase the pace of our investments, and there's lots of areas to invest in. I mentioned a few of them, but it's like CTV and platform updates in international and we have identity and measurement. There's all these areas for us that we can focus on. So what I would say about kind of like expenses and/or EBITDA is, I'm really optimistic about our ability to drive meaningful EBITDA at scale. But I would -- and I'd say this generally, relatively frequently, we do not manage to an EBITDA target. We want to invest in areas that drive growth, but we also want to be mindful of efficiency gains we can get as we scale. And so over the long-term, I'm confident that when we do return to normal, whenever that is, your guess is about that's as good as mine. Our margin structure should be as good as it was pre-COVID. And over the long run, as we scale, it could potentially be even better. But again, on a more of a short-term basis, we do not manage to an EBITDA target, and we'll retain that flexibility.\nJeffGreen: Yes, Shyam, I'll just add a little bit of color because Blake just covered it really well. So one thing to highlight on Unified ID is that cookies will exist throughout the year. So anything that happens in UID is upside, nothing but upside that comes from that because they\u2019ll coexists, cookies and UID. So there is definitely a ton of momentum there, so upside potential. Of course, our Walmart announcement, partnering with the biggest retailer in the world who also has amazing off line data. So it's really important when you're comparing, for instance, a Walmart to an Amazon, there's still a lot of products, especially household products that are mostly bought in the store and being able to connect that to online ads at the scale that we're doing here is something that is unprecedented in terms of closing the loop. I just want to give one click down on what Blake said on the verticals recovering. So we're forecasting this acceleration when you extract political, and that includes a recognition that travel and entertainment and much of real estate is still on the sidelines. So there's still a lot of room for recovery in some of those. And of course, that includes things like sports. And then lastly, on the international, just to give a little bit more color, like one thing I'm really excited about is just our growth around the world. We're seeing acceleration in most of our offices in Europe, most of our offices in Asia. And I'll just call out one of them. Shanghai started the year -- so our Mainland China office, started the year as our smallest office. It did not end the year as our smallest office. And it was our fastest growing office all year long. So just a ton of reasons to be optimistic about 2021.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov.\nVasilyKarasyov: I wanted to follow-up on the Unified ID 2.0 conversation. So it seems like there is very active news flow continued since the last quarter call. My question is, where do you think we are in terms of Unified ID adoption for your business and the open Internet in general? And then wanted to hear what your goals are over the next year that leads up to the deprecation of cookies. So would appreciate your thoughts on this.\nJeffGreen: Absolutely. And I appreciate you asking the question and the opportunity to talk about UID at a macro level. So the momentum could not be any better. And especially some of the most important adopters early on include names like Nielsen, which is really the gold standard of measurement in television for the last 50 plus years, LiveRamp, Criteo, Fubo, The Washington Post, which includes Zeus, which is basically tech that's provided to 100 plus newspapers and journalistic outlets. Every major SSP, which represents thousands and thousands of publishers. We talked about the governing bodies of PRAM and Prebid in the prepared remarks. But if you know anything about the way that Internet is governed, PRAM and Prebid and the IAB play all significant roles in the governance of the Internet and to have their support and adoption is really great. And in fact, their commitment to help govern this going forward. In terms of next phase and what we expect over the course of the year, I expect, at some point next year, this to be the currency for the open Internet, meaning that it's adopted everywhere. What you're seeing now is a ton of support and commitment. I think it's fair to say we just now are entering the beta phase where everybody is working on implementation. But what has been proven in all these discussions, and the people we're talking to are people that understand the way the Internet works and is monetized. They recognize that out of this is an upgrade to cookies in every meaningful way. The consumers are getting more privacy controls and better management. Advertisers are getting more relevant ads and better measurement. Publishers can maintain or improve CPM, which incidentally is critical to the future of journalism. And the government gets a product that is more in line with things like GDPR and CCPA than any current solution or proposed alternative, and it's an upgrade to cookies from almost every perspective, most notably it comes with terms and conditions, which cookies never did and it's encrypted, which provides a level of security that cookies never could provide. So when you put all that stuff together, it's understandable why we have so much momentum. And right now, it's just an issue of implementation, and there are 100-plus companies working on implementation today.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali.\nYoussefSquali: Jeff, congrats on a really good performance. So I want to go back to the Walmart partnership that you announced. Can you maybe just help impact that opportunity for us a little bit more? I mean, shopper market and trade promotion for Amazon has been a huge opportunity, and they've been able to really deliver on it. Just wondering how you guys think about it in terms of not just -- I know it won't be launching until the end of the year. But as we look at this business over the next two to three years, how big can that be for you? And then beyond just Walmart, does that open up opportunities for other partners? Thank you.\nJeffGreen: First of all, thanks again for the compliment and for the question. I'm really grateful for the opportunity to talk more about this amazing partnership. So this is a case of taking best of breed tech in The Trade Desk and combining it with best of breed shopper data. And I'm not certain that there's better shopper data. I don't think there's better shopper data anywhere in the world than what Walmart has. And let me be really clear on what we as partners are after here. We are trying to help Unilever sell more Dove soap and Procter & Gamble sell more Tide detergent and Hershey's sell more chocolate bars. And Walmart wants them to sell more of that stuff in their stores. And so what this does is by Walmart making this data available, it makes it possible for all of those companies and obviously, thousands of others, to optimize their media buys to sell more product in Walmart. And whether that's in their online presence or their brick and mortar presence. And of course, they\u2019re the biggest brick and mortar retailer in the world, the biggest retailer in the world, but especially and uniquely just had an amazing presence in the brick and mortar space fast-growing online business. So by optimizing their media spend, then Walmart gets more sales. And then they also close the loop for those suppliers so that they continue to improve the efficacy of their media buys. Because I believe this is something of the holy grail for the companies that sell product in a Walmart, it makes absolute sense for other companies like Walmart to do exactly the same thing. So I anticipate that they will be doing that. And there's tons of opportunity for The Trade Desk to partner there as well, but we're just so delighted to have started with the biggest and believe it will have a big impact on our business in the future.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald.\nBrianFitzgerald: On Connected TV, it seems like CTV had its strongest quarter growth ever. We wanted to confirm that, just the way we were kind of looking at our numbers. And then what percentage of linear spend could be migrated to Connected TV given the current inventory availability? And maybe just one more on the inventory availability. When you look at 59% of linear buyers who are saying, hey, we're making less upfront commits, P&G stepping away. How much Connected TV inventory do you think is currently in the upfront process? And anything you can do to capture some of that or watch how that shifts to away from the upfront process?\nJeffGreen: Yes. So a lot to unpack there. So first, I'll just say that 2020 will, without a doubt, go down in history as a tipping point for TV. And that's largely because the number of people subscribing to cable drop below the number of people that are accessing their television experience over the Internet and CTV. And because of that, CTV spend on our platform more than doubled in 2020. Over 1,000 brands spent over $100,000 on our platform last year, and then those advertisers spending over $1 million more than doubled last year. So CTV is, without a doubt, the fastest growing and also just there being a bit of a referendum on user generated content, that also helps move things over. As it relates to how much can move over from linear? Honestly, that's more of a macro question than it is about our business specifically. But I'll point to the vectors that I think will dictate whether or not that happens. One is a huge reason why there was so much move away from cable last year is just because it's the most expensive part of the TV experience. So if you believe that the economic pressure on the consumer, especially the US consumer, is going to continue, then you can expect cord cutting to continue at the high rate that it has been. If you think it's going to get worse then I think you can expect it to accelerate. You also have to believe that the amazing content that has been put out there that we'll continue to find ways to put that in the Connected TV ecosystem. And as long as that happens, I'm confident that AVOD will continue to be the preferred way for people to monetize, especially when we go incremental from here. So to me, those are some of the big macro vectors that you have to consider. But I think that there's nothing but upside and it's all about a question of when, not if. It is inevitable that all of TV will eventually be consumed over the Internet and the linear or broadcast television is going away.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Beckel with Berenberg.\nDavidBeckel: Two questions, if I could. First, on Walmart again. I was hoping you was hoping you could provide a little bit of context around the structure of that partnership financially. Is that the type of deal where you'll be able to participate in the growth of that platform over time or is it more of a fixed fee type of arrangement? And secondly, on UID, we hear from the industry some concerns about scale, will enough people or users actually log into the SSO. I'm curious to hear your thoughts, what level of user participation, in percentage or whatever metric you prefer, would UID 2.0 need in order to replicate the efficiency cookies today? Thanks.\nJeffGreen: So first, on the Walmart piece, I'll just speak at a very high level. And that is we are both highly incentivized to help sell more Dove soap and more Tide detergent and more Hershey chocolate bars. And if we do that, we both benefit. We both scale with the outcome. So in other words, we're both going to participate in the upside. On your question on Unified ID. So with Unified ID, we will launch a single sign-on, and that's largely to give publishers, the long tail publishers, an opportunity to manage their single sign on themselves without having to create one. So right now, they're somewhat dependent on the walled gardens, typically, a Google or a Facebook are the ones that are providing the log in opportunity. But it doesn't provide them with the same opportunity to monetize, and definitely doesn't give the open Internet a chance to compare one property to another. So this single sign on would come with more features for the publisher themselves. And again, it's for long tail publishers. However, in order to create a Unified ID, we don't need that single sign on to be present, that's a service for the long tail. But what really has to happen is the biggest advertisers and the biggest publishers have to adopt it, and that alone gets enough touches on the Internet to give it the scale required. And because this does not have the syncing requirements, meaning the constant connecting this cookie to this cookie that happens in the status bar of your browser constantly today, because this does not have that, we simply need that head of the Internet. Those large publishers and large advertisers to adopt this. And then it has a scaled response to the rest of the Internet and also makes it just fairly easy and obvious for everyone else to use it, but it also requires less work from them at that point. So I think a few have wrongly thought that we have to get millions and millions of websites to get the SSO in order for this all to work, and that's just not true.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\nJustinPatterson: Two, if I can. First, in terms of just thinking about verticals over the course of the year. Could you talk about how we should think about the sectors that were affected by COVID-19 rebounding? So that's question number one. And then question number two, as there's more focus on privacy on IDFA, are there any particular channels like Connected TV that you think could just benefit from budget shift, does that 10% that's affected shift over to other channels? Thanks so much.\nJeffGreen: So I'll take a stab at the verticals. And then, Blake, do you want to add anything at that point or do you want to go first?\nBlakeGrayson: I can -- let me just take a stab. I guess on the verticals, so much of it is going to depend on how the world opens up. So I think that that's going to be kind of that leading indicator. Like Jeff mentioned, we've already seen, obviously, some pretty positive trends out of some of our largest verticals. And so then and still room, we think, to grow. I think I mentioned automotive showed a pretty good bounce back from Q3 to Q4. And then Jeff mentioned and I mentioned as well travel, but like the real estate and entertainment verticals. I think that it's going to be a bit of a macro side of that on how and when those open up and when those industries begin to start opening up their investment and their spend accordingly. But that's probably about as detailed of a description as I can get from a vertical standpoint.\nJeffGreen: I think Blake nailed it. At the early phase, we had pharma and CPG and all the things that people were consuming in their houses as we started quarantine a little less than a year ago in most parts of the world. And there's still a bunch to go. So whether it's health and fitness, or food and drink, or home and garden, or automotive or travel, there's still parts of all of those to recover. In fact, many of those -- the majority of them are still sitting on the sidelines. As it relates to who will benefit from a shift away from IDFA, I really think the company that will benefit most will probably be Chrome or Google's Chrome, which will -- by moving away from IDFA, I just think it reinforces that Chrome is a better browser and just the friction in the Apple ecosystem is sort of challenging, or trying to capture the value exchange or the quid pro quo of the Internet that I think is doing well. Everywhere else and is the bias of every consumer and because Google in Chrome, at this point, manages that, I think, pretty well. I think they'll benefit from it. In terms of specific verticals or would CTV benefit from it, I think CTV has so much wind at its back. It can get a little bit more, and that will help. And I do think basically everything else will benefit from it. And because people are being so data driven at this moment, the things that are on sale or performing really well are going to get whatever gets rotated out of a specific sector, and that is going to mean that CTV and Audio are going to benefit most, if you're looking at it via channel.\nOperator: Your last question today is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nJamesHeaney: This is James Heaney on for Brent. Last quarter, you talked about the benefit that you saw from social media ad dollars shifting to your platform. Is there any way you can quantify the impact that you saw this quarter and maybe what you're seeing so far in Q1? And how are you positioning yourself to capture share from advertisers that are increasingly focused on brand safety? Thanks.\nJeffGreen: So I'm not quite sure how to quantify in the Q4, specifically what's come from things rotating out of social media. But I will just talk at a high level about what the trend has been in 2020 and continuing into 2021 as it relates to brand safety. And I think the election had a lot to do with this just because in the election, there's a lot of -- I don't know that we've had a more polarizing one in the United States in my lifetime. And there was, of course, concern of misinformation in the middle of that and there's a lower tolerance for misinformation, I think, during a global pandemic. So you put all of those together and people are just more skeptical of user generated content. And so one of the things that has been really great for us and also really great for Connected TV is that there's not much doubt about the premium nature of Connected TV. And people have better visibility on where things are going to fall, I mean, where ads are going to show up. So that scrutiny continues today. There's more and more work that has to be done by everybody, including us, to make certain that we keep the open Internet as clear from bad actors and misinformation as possible. But as we continue to do more work, deploy more technology against it, it continues to get cleaner and cleaner and we're just inherently in a better place than I think any other company of our size and scale in the sense that we are pointed at the most premium parts of the open Internet, and that is inherently a safer place to be.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the floor back to Chris Toth for closing remarks.\nChris Toth: Thank you, Catherine. Thanks, everyone, for joining. I know we ran a few minutes over the top of the hour, but really good questions again. So thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you over the remainder of the quarter, and have a good night, everyone. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Hello, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2020 was a uniquely challenging year from a variety of dimensions. At the same time, however, 2020 also represented an inflection point for our company. It was a year that advertisers became more deliberate with every advertising dollar shifting spend towards the open Internet. There were a lot of drivers of change in 2020, which included an unprecedented global pandemic, the rise of social justice issues, a divisive election in the United States and stronger economic pressures and higher levels of uncertainty weighing on nearly all of the consumers in the world. These drivers of change have already manifested themselves for marketers, whether it's the accelerated shift to CTV or the demand for better cross-device measurement and ROI, or brands and advertisers reassessing the value of user-generated content in their now more deliberate marketing plans. I want to spend a few minutes today explaining what the 2020 inflection point means for our company and our industry moving forward. 2020 was a year that the world had more uncertainty and more change than usual. While at TTD, like the rest of the world, we'd like to get back to a world that is a little more predictable and feels a bit more like what we called normal in 2019. So much happened in 2020, both inside and outside of our company that better positions the Trade Desk for a bigger and brighter future. So I need to give you my perspective on what happened in 2020 to show why I believe we're so well positioned in 2021 and beyond, as the digital advertising market matures and more marketers gravitate to the open Internet. Let me start with the highlight numbers. Spend on our platform in 2020 was nearly $4.2 billion, a record. Fourth quarter spend alone was over $1.6 billion, also a record. CTV spend more than doubled for the year. And once again, despite all the uncertainty of the year, we delivered strong profitability highlighting the operating leverage we have in our business. We often benchmark our results against the Rule of 40 of other high-growth companies of our size, where the health of a technology company is expressed as the sum of a company's growth rate and EBITDA margin. 40% is healthy. In 2020, we finished at over 60%, all while we are investing in our future as fast as we can. According to eMarketer, our total global ad spending declined 4.5% last year. Meanwhile, spend on our platform grew 34%. Even amid the uncertainty of 2020, where all marketers reevaluated their ad campaigns in some way, shape or form, they continued to shift, spend and invest in ad opportunities that are dynamic and measurable. We were able to drive this performance and take so much share, even as some of the verticals we serve such as travel, auto, entertainment and real estate continued to be in a state of flux. They have all yet to fully recover. Obviously, we benefited from the surge in political advertising last year, which represented a high single-digit contribution to our growth in the fourth quarter. And by the way, we're very proud of the work we did in political last year, especially our role in representing a better process for all political candidates. As many companies agonize over the role they should play, we were clear from the outset. We are an objective and independent platform open to register candidates on all sides. I continue to believe that the data-driven advertising has an important role to play in the political arena. On a platform such as ours, candidates are more likely to focus on the substantive issues that voters care about, leveraging premium inventory versus the divisive that user-generated content often found on some social media platforms and some UGC video platforms. But even as we point out the political advertising surge we saw in 2020, political tilled a hole for Trade Desk that was left by other advertisers and other important verticals that have not yet returned to their pre-pandemic levels. We expect them to improve through this year, hopefully. We start to return to some sense of normal. More broadly, I fully expect that the trends we saw in 2020 continue to accelerate in the years ahead as advertisers increasingly gravitate to our platform. To give you a sense of these trends and why I'm so optimistic, I want to cover three main areas. First, I'd like to take a look at TV and how 2020 was a turning point for many marketers and their massive TV ad campaigns. What's happening in TV is not limited to that channel, it's driving change across the ad ecosystem. Second, it's important to focus for a minute on the future of relevant advertising and in particular, how the industry is thinking about identity. And third, and finally, I want to summarize how these factors, among others, are critical as the ad industry starts to gravitate toward the open Internet, a trend that I expect to accelerate in years ahead. So first, the changing nature of TV. We've talked a lot over the last 12 months about how the pandemic accelerated trends that were already underway, but we couldn't have predicted quite how sharp that acceleration would be. With most consumers working from home, not surprisingly, more and more of them are shifting from cable to streaming TV. The on-demand nature of streaming makes for a better experience. However, the new economic pressure is weighing on the average consumer are also forcing an even bigger change. Whether you look at our numbers or MAGNA Global's or eMarketer's, the trend is undeniable. We are right around that point where there are more U.S. households without a cable subscription than those with one, and that trend is not reversing. Dig a little deeper and you'll find that younger generations, the 18 to 34-year olds, highly coveted by many advertisers have even less interest in cable. And if you look beyond the U.S. at Asia, for example, you'll see in many markets that the notion of a big screen in the living room is less conventional. In Asia, premium video is often consumed on a mobile device. But perhaps more important than all that data is, where we go from here, because 2020 was a wake up call to the advertising industry, when it came to TV. I can't put it any better than Mark Pritchard did, the Chief Brand Officer of P&G, the world's largest advertiser. I was on stage with him at CES a few weeks ago, virtually, of course, and he talked about how 2020 has forced advertisers into a world of ''constructive disruption''. He highlighted the upfront process, which he described as a hold over from the 1950s where TV ad campaigns were tied to new vehicle launches every year \u2013 every fall. He talked about the need to be more flexible, more real-time to bring the same measurement techniques we've grown accustomed to in digital to the world of TV. Ultimately, he and I believe we are heading toward an inevitable future, where all of advertising is, and I quote using his words, digital, programmatic, data-driven and automatic. By the way, he's not alone in this thinking about the upfronts. According to our research, 60% of linear TV ad buyers are planning to spend less at the upfront this year for these very same reasons. One of them, the Head of TV ad buying at a global life sciences company told us that, '' traditional upfront media buying is the most disconnected area of media and business today''. And it's not just advertisers who are thinking differently, the content providers are too. And on that same stage, Linda Yaccarino of NBC, talked about how CTV has freed the network of the, \u201chandcuffs of legacy stuff\u201d, that was preventing them from delivering on the new data-driven needs of their advertisers. It's liberating for the entire market, and that's one reason why CTV stood out in a year when across the industry overall ad spending was down. CTV was the strongest growth segment of the global ad market last year and the fastest growing channel on our platforms as well, and that's because advertisers see their customers moving to streaming platforms and they are learning that CTV offers a new kind of value. Advertisers can apply data to drive more precision and localized targeting than linear. They can measure performance in real time across platforms. They can pivot campaigns quickly based on performance feedback and they can experiment with new formats. In a year when brands are challenged to adopt messaging, often on a highly local basis based on rapidly changing circumstances, all of these factors become compelling. Take a large US automotive research and e-commerce brand that needs to navigate the uncertainty of 2020 and in particular, the economic fallout on their business because of the pandemic. This company needed more flexibility and agility. Throughout the year, they pulled as many dollars as they could out from their existing underperforming upfront contracts and linear budgets and move those dollars to CTV on our platform. With their agency, they chose The Trade Desk platform for two main reasons; one was the ability to apply data-driven decisioning and measurement in real-time in order to adapt to the rapidly changing market conditions; the second was to access premium inventory at scale in specific local markets on networks such as NBC and Discovery. This is not an isolated case. In fact, in 2020, more than 1,000 brands spent at least $100,000 on CTV on our platform. Those brands spending more than $1 million on our platform in 2020, more than doubled from a year ago. When you factor in that CTV now has the scale to provide an alternative to the divisive user generated content that often populates big social and video platforms, you can see why CTV was the largest growth segment of the global advertising market last year. But let me take this one step further. Until 2020, TV was the last bastion of analog advertising. At the same time, it is also the largest segment of the advertising pie. Marketers know that video is the best channel to win the hearts and minds of consumers. TV is where marketers spend the most money and is often where the most creative talent resides within a brand. It's also where the power centers of an agency typically reside. The market opportunity here is significant. Eventually, all TV advertising will be digital and programmatic. In fact, I believe premium video, in all of its form, including CTV, will be half of the $1 trillion advertising market in the not too distant future. CTV is a Trojan horse for the acceleration of programmatic across the ad industry, and we're starting to see that play out now. Which brings me to my second topic, the future of relevant advertising and how the industry is coming together to forge a new path for identity. This is not simply a question of updating you about UID 2.0. I'll get to that. But before I do, I'm not sure we've been clear enough about a key point. Right now, many people are debating what identity solution has the best chance of replacing third party cookies. But I feel like we're having the wrong conversation. Instead, we should be focused on the question of how to make the open Internet a symphony that maximizes the talents of every orchestra member, playing together, rather than looking for a single solution, the most impressive work is done by those of us making solutions interoperable, creating a currency that can be used by all reputable players and upgrading all the weaknesses of cookies. UID 2.0 is the new common currency of the open Internet, one that respects privacy and improves consumer controls, while preserving the value exchange of relevant advertising. UID 2.0 is also free. And as we speak, it is being integrated into the transactional pipes of the entire open Internet. And that common currency is not just centered on if this new currency allows for effective comparison and measurability across all advertising channels across the open Internet. Ultimately, that's what advertisers care about most. If you were to ask most of them, they'd probably say they expect the identity piece to get fixed and they expect the key industry players, such as The Trade Desk, to figure that out for them. What advertisers really want is a trusted system that solves the identity problem while also solving for the measurement opportunity. And if we get that right, once again, we prove out the value of the open Internet versus the limitations of walled gardens, where measurement is typically some variation of grading your own homework. And it's also why I'm so excited about the progress the industry has made with Unified ID 2.0. Pretty much the entire ad tech ecosystem has signed on. Among SSPs, Index Exchange, Magnite, PubMatic, OpenX and SpotX are all on board. Criteo has become a great partner. Like us, they're all in on UID 2.0. Among data connectivity companies, LiveRamp and Neustar are integrating UID. Publishers such as Mediavine and Fubo TV are now part of the UID community, along with The Washington Post and their Zeus Technology platform that powers over 100 other media publishers, including some of the leading daily newspapers in the United States. Those are just the ones we've announced. There are many others that we're working with actively, including publishers, advertisers, partners, large media companies, data companies and even other DSPs. But perhaps most telling about the future common currency of the Internet is the work we're doing with Nielsen. As you know, Nielsen is the gold standard in media measurement, especially for TV. But as the media world becomes more fragmented and more digital, they are overhauling their technology to stay at the bleeding edge. And Unified ID 2.0 will be a core element of that new offering. Why? Because like us, Nielsen believes that UID 2.0 will become the new common currency of the open Internet. They understand what an upgrade this represents to cookies. In addition to the wide ranging industry support for Unified ID 2.0, there's also been a lot of progress around independent governance. As we have said from the beginning, an identity solution is much bigger than any one company, including The Trade Desk. As you may have seen, UID 2.0 has been submitted to the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media, or PRAM, for further community development and management. PRAM comprises the biggest advertising brands, the major agencies and the leading ad tech players in the world. PRAM was designed to oversee the administration of new identity tools that advance the open Internet, such as UID. Governance of UID will ultimately be federated. And Prebid, an industry organization committed to transparency and fairness in header bidding, has already signed on to be one of the governing organizations of UID. What's also been very interesting about the evolution of UID 2.0 is not just the enthusiasm in the United States but also demand to understand its application around the world. And to understand the importance of the interest worldwide, you need to appreciate how various privacy and consumer protection regulations have come into force around the world. Take GDPR in Europe, for example. GDPR was an important initiative to craft new legislation to protect consumers as the Internet started to reach into every aspect of our lives. At its core, GDPR, like a great deal of privacy regulation we see around the world, is based on important philosophical principles. But it's not necessarily prescriptive. It's up to market participants to interpret GDPR and figure out what to do. Without prescription and without case law, everyone is working on solutions that meet requirements and building that important body of use cases. In my view, Unified ID 2.0 comes closest to meeting the evolving philosophical principles that we see getting legislated around the world, including in Europe. Not simply because it's highly secure and it moves control to the consumers' hands, but also because Unified ID solves for the other key aspect of becoming a common currency of digital advertising. Unified ID 2.0 also allows for cross channel measurement across the entire open Internet. I am very deliberately focused on CTV and identity so far because they are transformative and how we think about the value of the open Internet versus the smaller, less competitive Internet that is primarily run inside of walled gardens, which is the third main point I want to make with you this afternoon. Until now, when we think about every new dollar that goes into digital advertising, we think about that dollar going into a Facebook or a Google first. Because these platforms are easy, there's easy access to scale. The open Internet has traditionally received the leftovers, but that dynamic is starting to change. At end state, the first dollar goes to the open Internet. So why am I so optimistic about this? Because in 2020, we started to see the signs of the tide turning. As it continues, this won't happen overnight. It's going to take years, but it is starting to happen. You only have to listen to Marc Pritchard and thousands of other major brand marketers who we interact with every day, hear them talk about the importance of being deliberate, data driven and measurable across multiple platforms and channels. That can really only happen on the open Internet. Walled gardens are not the easy on-ramp for CTV. In fact, they often don't have access to the premium content most valued by marketers. And often, targeting is limited and results are too. Relatedly, let's consider what happened in UGC in 2020. Last year, brands became more aware than ever that their ads may be showing up against questionable use of generated content and the device and viral discussions that UGC content can sometimes incite. Advertisers want an alternative. And in 2020, they started to look at CTV as the scalable brand safe platform that gets them the same reach with better performance measurement. UID adoptions are even better than expected. Publishers, brands, suppliers, data companies, partners and even competitors, everyone wants the open Internet to operate with the highest level of privacy and consumer controls, while also preserving the value exchange of relevant advertising through cross channel measurement. UID cracks the code on that and it's inspiring to see the industry rally around a solution bigger than any one company. Now UID won't exist in isolation. In fact, I would argue that there will be a handful of other identity technologies in the market. That's okay. It's even good because the focus is on interoperability. But perhaps nothing highlights this shift more than the news we announced a few weeks ago around our new partnership with Walmart. The work we're doing with Walmart is actually indicative of an entire industry that is starting to shift to a data-first marketing model. This is significant for our business because, according to some estimates, the TAM for shopper marketing is well over $100 billion. Let me use Walmart to explain. Walmart is the world's largest retailer after all, with the world's largest supply of shopper data, across a massive array of consumer products. And for the first time with this partnership, they are making that shopper data available to advertisers. So Walmart suppliers, who happen to be among the world's leading advertisers, can now run digital ads, whether on mobile, desktop, CTV, audio, et cetera, and understand how shoppers are reacting to those apps. By that, I mean which ones led to sales and when. And advertisers can then refine those ad campaigns based on which ones work best with which kind of customers, at what times and what channels and what regions and near which stores. For consumer packaged goods companies, this is something of a holy grail. They can adapt campaigns on the fly based on the data they get back on shopper reactions. So the advertising process becomes more refined, more effective and more valuable. This is especially true in Walmart's case because not only are they a fast growing online retailer, but Walmart is also the largest brick and mortar retailer in the world. The integrated approach to data and measurement will apply to both aspects of their business. If you're a major CPG company, you may have many products such as Tide laundry detergent or a Hershey chocolate bar that are still sold primarily in the store. So this integrated approach is critical. Because we are talking about some of the most valuable shopper data in the world, Walmart wants to make sure that data is managed securely with all the appropriate consumer privacy controls. They could have built their own platform, which makes us even more honored that we have forged a partnership and are leveraging our scale together. Instead, they are focused on the combination of Walmart shopper data and the technology and performance of The Trade Desk platform. Not only does our platform provide the data controls Walmart demands, they know we are an independent and objective company and they know their supplier clients already work with us and trust us. And as I said, it's not just Walmart that's driving this shift in the retail industry, most major retailers recognize the value and power of their shopper data. Those retailers are also working with us to liberate data so their suppliers can market more effectively in a secure privacy safe way. The go to market approach for each retailer may be slightly different, but the common thread is that these retailers understand that the only way to realize the full value of their data is on the open Internet. There's no point building walls around it. Brands will, over time, always gravitate to the places where they can be deliberate and where they can measure ad impressions across channels. I'd like to wrap this up by tying these all together. As I said, marketers are driving a game changing revolution in TV advertising based on conviction that they need to be more data driven, more deliberate and more measurable. Partly driven by the shift in TV advertising, major brands are now talking about the future being data driven and programmatic across all channels. I hear it from every customer I talk to across all industries. That new data driven focus is also driving momentum around new identity solutions that not only boost consumer privacy, but also become a common currency that is key to cross channel measurement. And you can see this playing out as companies such as Walmart and the retail industry more broadly are standardizing on The Trade Desk as they overhaul their digital marketing business. It all points to the growing primacy of the open Internet and that's where we win. As this shift accelerates in the years ahead, and it will, we have the opportunity to become the de facto demand side platform for the open Internet. I am confident about our future. Now everything won't happen overnight or in one quarter, of course, but we've spent 10 years getting ready for this opportunity. It's why we continue to invest in our platform with the biggest product launch in our history coming later this year, which is all centered on helping our clients drive value from their data across advertising channels. It's why we continue to focus so aggressively on international growth. This is a global shift. And I'm very excited that our international growth is now outpacing our North America growth. That's a very positive sign that we are investing in the right way in the right places. And it's why we continue to work hard to drive the industry forward with initiatives such as Unified ID 2.0. This work is critical to build trust as the shift to the open Internet unfolds. It raises all boats, including ours. Our focus allows us to continue to exceed our expectations. As I said at the outset, 2020 was a very challenging year but it was also a transformative one for us and our industry. I could not be more excited about building on our progress in 2021. With that, let me hand it over to Blake to cover the financials. Yes. Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the compliment as well as the question. So at times when I've answered this question in the past, I've perhaps given too much color on both the micro and the macro. And let me just talk specifically this time about how it affects us, The Trade Desk. So about 10% of our spend uses IDFA. That's meaningfully different than most other digital companies who are spending a lot of time talking about this. We also are a demand-side platform. We are not a publisher. We are not a destination, if you will, where you're logging on to our app or our website. So by being a demand-side platform, what we do is we look at about 12 million ad opportunities every single second. And so if a million of those, ish, have an identifier missing, so in other words, you take away IDFA, we still have 11 million to choose from. So we just choose from those that are left, the 11 million that are left. So even the 10% that has the IDFA on it today, we've just found some amount of signal to make it worth buying, but it's already something that we sort of steer away from, which is why it's not that much of our business. Which is why I can say definitively, I don't believe this will have any material impact on our business the way that it affects others. And I just want to put a finer point on it and just dispel the myth. Unlike a platform or a destination like a Pinterest or a Snapchat, where you have to monetize every ad on your site when a visitor comes there, you have to monetize it. If that's attached to an IDFA phone, for instance, or an Apple phone, then you still have to find a way to monetize it and you're going to monetize it at a discount. Those are the very same ads that we, on the demand side, are passing over. So because of the fact that we are on the demand side, that's why we're not impacted the way that those others are. It's not a difference of opinion, it's a difference of location in the supply chain. You bet. Yes, Shyam, I'll just add a little bit of color because Blake just covered it really well. So one thing to highlight on Unified ID is that cookies will exist throughout the year. So anything that happens in UID is upside, nothing but upside that comes from that because they'll coexists, cookies and UID. So there is definitely a ton of momentum there, so upside potential. Of course, our Walmart announcement, partnering with the biggest retailer in the world who also has amazing off line data. So it's really important when you're comparing, for instance, a Walmart to an Amazon, there's still a lot of products, especially household products that are mostly bought in the store and being able to connect that to online ads at the scale that we're doing here is something that is unprecedented in terms of closing the loop. I just want to give one click down on what Blake said on the verticals recovering. So we're forecasting this acceleration when you extract political, and that includes a recognition that travel and entertainment and much of real estate is still on the sidelines. So there's still a lot of room for recovery in some of those. And of course, that includes things like sports. And then lastly, on the international, just to give a little bit more color, like one thing I'm really excited about is just our growth around the world. We're seeing acceleration in most of our offices in Europe, most of our offices in Asia. And I'll just call out one of them. Shanghai started the year -- so our Mainland China office, started the year as our smallest office. It did not end the year as our smallest office. And it was our fastest growing office all year long. So just a ton of reasons to be optimistic about 2021. Absolutely. And I appreciate you asking the question and the opportunity to talk about UID at a macro level. So the momentum could not be any better. And especially some of the most important adopters early on include names like Nielsen, which is really the gold standard of measurement in television for the last 50 plus years, LiveRamp, Criteo, Fubo, The Washington Post, which includes Zeus, which is basically tech that's provided to 100 plus newspapers and journalistic outlets. Every major SSP, which represents thousands and thousands of publishers. We talked about the governing bodies of PRAM and Prebid in the prepared remarks. But if you know anything about the way that Internet is governed, PRAM and Prebid and the IAB play all significant roles in the governance of the Internet and to have their support and adoption is really great. And in fact, their commitment to help govern this going forward. In terms of next phase and what we expect over the course of the year, I expect, at some point next year, this to be the currency for the open Internet, meaning that it's adopted everywhere. What you're seeing now is a ton of support and commitment. I think it's fair to say we just now are entering the beta phase where everybody is working on implementation. But what has been proven in all these discussions, and the people we're talking to are people that understand the way the Internet works and is monetized. They recognize that out of this is an upgrade to cookies in every meaningful way. The consumers are getting more privacy controls and better management. Advertisers are getting more relevant ads and better measurement. Publishers can maintain or improve CPM, which incidentally is critical to the future of journalism. And the government gets a product that is more in line with things like GDPR and CCPA than any current solution or proposed alternative, and it's an upgrade to cookies from almost every perspective, most notably it comes with terms and conditions, which cookies never did and it's encrypted, which provides a level of security that cookies never could provide. So when you put all that stuff together, it's understandable why we have so much momentum. And right now, it's just an issue of implementation, and there are 100-plus companies working on implementation today. First of all, thanks again for the compliment and for the question. I'm really grateful for the opportunity to talk more about this amazing partnership. So this is a case of taking best of breed tech in The Trade Desk and combining it with best of breed shopper data. And I'm not certain that there's better shopper data. I don't think there's better shopper data anywhere in the world than what Walmart has. And let me be really clear on what we as partners are after here. We are trying to help Unilever sell more Dove soap and Procter & Gamble sell more Tide detergent and Hershey's sell more chocolate bars. And Walmart wants them to sell more of that stuff in their stores. And so what this does is by Walmart making this data available, it makes it possible for all of those companies and obviously, thousands of others, to optimize their media buys to sell more product in Walmart. And whether that's in their online presence or their brick and mortar presence. And of course, they're the biggest brick and mortar retailer in the world, the biggest retailer in the world, but especially and uniquely just had an amazing presence in the brick and mortar space fast-growing online business. So by optimizing their media spend, then Walmart gets more sales. And then they also close the loop for those suppliers so that they continue to improve the efficacy of their media buys. Because I believe this is something of the holy grail for the companies that sell product in a Walmart, it makes absolute sense for other companies like Walmart to do exactly the same thing. So I anticipate that they will be doing that. And there's tons of opportunity for The Trade Desk to partner there as well, but we're just so delighted to have started with the biggest and believe it will have a big impact on our business in the future. Yes. So a lot to unpack there. So first, I'll just say that 2020 will, without a doubt, go down in history as a tipping point for TV. And that's largely because the number of people subscribing to cable drop below the number of people that are accessing their television experience over the Internet and CTV. And because of that, CTV spend on our platform more than doubled in 2020. Over 1,000 brands spent over $100,000 on our platform last year, and then those advertisers spending over $1 million more than doubled last year. So CTV is, without a doubt, the fastest growing and also just there being a bit of a referendum on user generated content, that also helps move things over. As it relates to how much can move over from linear? Honestly, that's more of a macro question than it is about our business specifically. But I'll point to the vectors that I think will dictate whether or not that happens. One is a huge reason why there was so much move away from cable last year is just because it's the most expensive part of the TV experience. So if you believe that the economic pressure on the consumer, especially the US consumer, is going to continue, then you can expect cord cutting to continue at the high rate that it has been. If you think it's going to get worse then I think you can expect it to accelerate. You also have to believe that the amazing content that has been put out there that we'll continue to find ways to put that in the Connected TV ecosystem. And as long as that happens, I'm confident that AVOD will continue to be the preferred way for people to monetize, especially when we go incremental from here. So to me, those are some of the big macro vectors that you have to consider. But I think that there's nothing but upside and it's all about a question of when, not if. It is inevitable that all of TV will eventually be consumed over the Internet and the linear or broadcast television is going away. So first, on the Walmart piece, I'll just speak at a very high level. And that is we are both highly incentivized to help sell more Dove soap and more Tide detergent and more Hershey chocolate bars. And if we do that, we both benefit. We both scale with the outcome. So in other words, we're both going to participate in the upside. On your question on Unified ID. So with Unified ID, we will launch a single sign-on, and that's largely to give publishers, the long tail publishers, an opportunity to manage their single sign on themselves without having to create one. So right now, they're somewhat dependent on the walled gardens, typically, a Google or a Facebook are the ones that are providing the log in opportunity. But it doesn't provide them with the same opportunity to monetize, and definitely doesn't give the open Internet a chance to compare one property to another. So this single sign on would come with more features for the publisher themselves. And again, it's for long tail publishers. However, in order to create a Unified ID, we don't need that single sign on to be present, that's a service for the long tail. But what really has to happen is the biggest advertisers and the biggest publishers have to adopt it, and that alone gets enough touches on the Internet to give it the scale required. And because this does not have the syncing requirements, meaning the constant connecting this cookie to this cookie that happens in the status bar of your browser constantly today, because this does not have that, we simply need that head of the Internet. Those large publishers and large advertisers to adopt this. And then it has a scaled response to the rest of the Internet and also makes it just fairly easy and obvious for everyone else to use it, but it also requires less work from them at that point. So I think a few have wrongly thought that we have to get millions and millions of websites to get the SSO in order for this all to work, and that's just not true. So I'll take a stab at the verticals. And then, Blake, do you want to add anything at that point or do you want to go first? I think Blake nailed it. At the early phase, we had pharma and CPG and all the things that people were consuming in their houses as we started quarantine a little less than a year ago in most parts of the world. And there's still a bunch to go. So whether it's health and fitness, or food and drink, or home and garden, or automotive or travel, there's still parts of all of those to recover. In fact, many of those -- the majority of them are still sitting on the sidelines. As it relates to who will benefit from a shift away from IDFA, I really think the company that will benefit most will probably be Chrome or Google's Chrome, which will -- by moving away from IDFA, I just think it reinforces that Chrome is a better browser and just the friction in the Apple ecosystem is sort of challenging, or trying to capture the value exchange or the quid pro quo of the Internet that I think is doing well. Everywhere else and is the bias of every consumer and because Google in Chrome, at this point, manages that, I think, pretty well. I think they'll benefit from it. In terms of specific verticals or would CTV benefit from it, I think CTV has so much wind at its back. It can get a little bit more, and that will help. And I do think basically everything else will benefit from it. And because people are being so data driven at this moment, the things that are on sale or performing really well are going to get whatever gets rotated out of a specific sector, and that is going to mean that CTV and Audio are going to benefit most, if you're looking at it via channel. So I'm not quite sure how to quantify in the Q4, specifically what's come from things rotating out of social media. But I will just talk at a high level about what the trend has been in 2020 and continuing into 2021 as it relates to brand safety. And I think the election had a lot to do with this just because in the election, there's a lot of -- I don't know that we've had a more polarizing one in the United States in my lifetime. And there was, of course, concern of misinformation in the middle of that and there's a lower tolerance for misinformation, I think, during a global pandemic. So you put all of those together and people are just more skeptical of user generated content. And so one of the things that has been really great for us and also really great for Connected TV is that there's not much doubt about the premium nature of Connected TV. And people have better visibility on where things are going to fall, I mean, where ads are going to show up. So that scrutiny continues today. There's more and more work that has to be done by everybody, including us, to make certain that we keep the open Internet as clear from bad actors and misinformation as possible. But as we continue to do more work, deploy more technology against it, it continues to get cleaner and cleaner and we're just inherently in a better place than I think any other company of our size and scale in the sense that we are pointed at the most premium parts of the open Internet, and that is inherently a safer place to be."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we finished 2020 incredibly strong, capping off a solid year for our business despite the challenges faced around the world. Q4 revenue was $320 million, a 48% increase from a year ago. For full year 2020, revenue was $836 million, a 26% increase from a year ago. We have been encouraged to see advertisers accelerate their shift to data driven advertising in the second-half of 2020. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the value that The Trade Desk provides to thousands of agencies and brands as they work to connect with their customers across our platform every day. With the strong top line performance in Q4, we generated $153 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 48% of revenue. As you have seen historically, when we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, which it did again in Q4. EBITDA continues to benefit from temporarily lower than expected operating expense growth, partly driven by the impacts related to COVID-19. Even recognizing that, I am proud of our continued ability to substantially grow our top line revenue, while also producing meaningfully positive EBITDA. From the channel perspective, video, which includes CTV, led our growth in Q4, followed by audio, mobile and display, which all grew in the double digits on a year-over-year basis. As Jeff had mentioned, connected TV continued to be our fastest growing channel. Geographically in Q4, similar to last quarter, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. All of our major regions, North America, APAC and Europe, grew spend well into the double digits again year-over-year in Q4. One anecdote we're excited about are early indicators of acceleration in Europe. Gross spend growth in Europe accelerated every month in Q4. And for the full quarter, actually grew faster than North America after excluding spend associated with the US Presidential election. It is still early days for us internationally, but we continue to expand our leadership team and are optimistic about our trends there. In terms of our verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly every category improved during the quarter; health and fitness, our largest vertical in 2020; shopping, which benefited from the holiday season; food and drink and home garden all performed very well. Automotive was also particularly encouraging as it bounced back quite a bit in Q4 versus the prior quarter. Travel continues to stand out in terms of delayed recovery. And while it improved slightly from Q3, it still has a lot of room for growth that we expect will follow as the world returns to normal, whenever that happens. And finally, as you can imagine, we had strong US political spend during the quarter. In Q4, political spend represented a high single digit percent share of our spend. For the full year 2020, political spend represented a mid-single digit percent share of our spend. And importantly, this impact was felt beyond just the second-half of the year. For example, the democratic primary races drove solid spend for us in Q1 as the month of February, in particular, was one of our stronger political spend months during the year. Operating expenses were $213 million in Q4, up 31% year-over-year. I would like to remind you that due to the virtual environment, our operating expense growth continues to benefit from lower than normal employee support costs, including travel and corporate events, which are running significantly lower than the prior year. Income tax was a benefit of $45 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $185 million or $3.71 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was a record $168 million for Q4 and free cash flow was $149 million. The primary drivers were the increase in net income as well as a number of efficiencies gained in working capital, some that occurred throughout the year, including improvement in collections activity, better alignment of payables to receivables and shorter payment terms, primarily due to the political advertising environment. DSOs exiting the quarter were 121 days, up three days from a year ago. DPOs were 101 days, up seven days from a year ago. We exited Q4 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $624 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at the end of the quarter. In early October, we paid off the remaining $72 million of our revolving line of credit that we drew down in the very early days of COVID-19 out of an abundance of caution. At the end of the quarter, we had no revolver debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. During the first month and a half, spend is strong, and we're off to a great start to the year. We estimate Q1 revenue to be between $214 million and $217 million, which would represent growth of between 33% to 35% on a year-over-year basis, a modest acceleration from our Q1 results in 2020. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at least $55 million in Q1. I would remind you that the relative strength in our EBITDA forecast is in part due to the virtual environment our teams are working in. As we think about the full year, we are modeling for an improving digital advertising environment and expect a reasonable acceleration in our revenue growth. That said, our business still continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has significantly affected our advertisers and their demand for advertising. In addition, and this is important as you think about your models, we face relatively easier comps in the first-half of 2021, especially in Q2 and then comped stronger performance in the second-half of the year, in particular Q4, where we significantly benefited from US political ad spend. I want to say a few words about our expected operating expenses. Starting late in Q1 of 2020, we reduced the pace of our spending due to the uncertain operating environment. As we saw demand begin to return in May, we strategically started to increase the pace of our investments. While we have made some progress, as we think about 2021, we do expect to continue to increase our investments over the course of the year as we continue to invest in the long term growth of the business. We expect 2021 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be similar to what we incurred in 2020. We do expect data center and infrastructure spend to represent a larger share of our expenditures relative to office facilities compared to the prior year. Share count is expected to be about 52 million as we exit 2021. In summary, Q4 represented a strong finish to 2020. I cannot say enough about how well the team is focusing on helping our customers, spinning the flywheel and staying mindful of efficiency while driving material spend on our platform while we invest in and scale our business. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Sure. Thanks for the question, Shyam. So I'll try to address them all here. So your math is correct. And so let me just try to walk through it. So 2020 accelerated trends that set us up pretty nicely for 2021 and beyond. But to your point, it's going to be a unique year in terms of comps on the quarters. And so, like I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we'll have an easier comp in the first-half of the year, especially Q2 and then we'll be comping stronger performance in the second-half of the year, especially Q4 because of that strong political spend that you mentioned. So as you think about moving from Q4 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021, it is really important to think about the political impact and strip that out if you're trying to do a sequential year-over-year comparison. So if you strip out the high single-digit percent spend in Q4 of 2020 and then you strip out from Q1 of 2020, that kind of mid-single, which we had referenced for the full-year, you will see that our Q1 guide actually shows acceleration from Q4, excluding political, which is a pretty good setup for us. And there's a lot of -- and then getting to your question about the full-year, there's a lot of positive trends, and Jeff can also add color at the end here regarding those that we're seeing. The obvious one is this continued shift to digital advertising and this just trend -- there's no trend really larger than this move to CTV. We're seeing verticals recovering with room still to grow in many of them. We have the kind of the UID momentum. We have the partnerships' momentum around things, places like Walmart and others that the team are working on. And we also have all the tools and the continuous platform updates associated with things like Solamar. So when you take all those things into account from a top line perspective, it's a pretty strong fundamental business. Just to repeat, we do see a reasonable acceleration for the full-year. And I'm really comfortable about our business and our setup for 2021. With regards to the OpEx component, a reminder that 2020 is a unique year in that in - late in the first quarter, we reduced our pace of investments. As we saw demand return kind of back in late Q2, we started to ramp that up. And then you also have to keep in mind the 2020 expenses were impacted by COVID related to like travel and events and support and things like that. So as I \u2013 as we think about 2021, we do expect to continue to increase the pace of our investments, and there's lots of areas to invest in. I mentioned a few of them, but it's like CTV and platform updates in international and we have identity and measurement. There's all these areas for us that we can focus on. So what I would say about kind of like expenses and/or EBITDA is, I'm really optimistic about our ability to drive meaningful EBITDA at scale. But I would -- and I'd say this generally, relatively frequently, we do not manage to an EBITDA target. We want to invest in areas that drive growth, but we also want to be mindful of efficiency gains we can get as we scale. And so over the long-term, I'm confident that when we do return to normal, whenever that is, your guess is about that's as good as mine. Our margin structure should be as good as it was pre-COVID. And over the long run, as we scale, it could potentially be even better. But again, on a more of a short-term basis, we do not manage to an EBITDA target, and we'll retain that flexibility. I can -- let me just take a stab. I guess on the verticals, so much of it is going to depend on how the world opens up. So I think that that's going to be kind of that leading indicator. Like Jeff mentioned, we've already seen, obviously, some pretty positive trends out of some of our largest verticals. And so then and still room, we think, to grow. I think I mentioned automotive showed a pretty good bounce back from Q3 to Q4. And then Jeff mentioned and I mentioned as well travel, but like the real estate and entertainment verticals. I think that it's going to be a bit of a macro side of that on how and when those open up and when those industries begin to start opening up their investment and their spend accordingly. But that's probably about as detailed of a description as I can get from a vertical standpoint."

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Toth. Please go ahead.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today are our Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that, except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the Q4 holiday season, and results of operations are subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize, or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provides a more meaningful representation of the company\u2019s operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Hello everyone and thank you for joining us. We are excited to announce the results of our third quarter. Despite the headwinds of a global pandemic, we had healthy growth in the third quarter, up 32% year-over-year, far surpassing our own expectations.  As we discussed, 2020 is a year where agility matters more than ever. In this environment, marketers have come to more fully appreciate the power of data-driven advertising. And as that happens, we are becoming indispensable. We have developed closer relationships with the biggest brands and agencies in the world, and we are winning more business, with both new and existing customers. In addition, we continue to see rapid growth in key channels, such as connected TV, which grew more than 100% year-over-year. This was a very encouraging quarter, not only in terms of our revenue and market share growth, but also what it signals about our growth opportunity moving forward. While our growth is very encouraging, we are still operating at a time of great uncertainty for many industries, but even in the midst of that uncertainty, we are clear that our role is to help our customers drive economic recovery. Advertising is an engine of economic growth, and our customers know that their campaigns can fuel growth and drive market share gains for their brands. And because of that, during times of uncertainty, they become much more deliberate.  That's not to say this is a straight line recovery for our customers. It's not. Often our customers are still being hurt by the global pandemic and the economic consequences of most people staying home. But while we are a long way from being completely out of the woods, I do believe that in 2020, so far, we have gained more market share or said another way grabbed more land than at any point in our company's history. We've accomplished this because advertisers have become more deliberate, and we are a part of the solution that helps them manage uncertainty and chart a path to grow. Our rate of grabbing land in Q3 might be the biggest bullish indicator we produced as a publicly traded company. Market share gains in 2020 is a testament to the strength of our value proposition and our customer relationship. That's what makes me more proud of our performance in the third quarter than any other quarter in The Trade Desk's history. Our team navigated uncertainty and helped the most sophisticated advertisers fuel their recovery, with new approaches to channels such as CTV. I'll come back to CTV in a few minutes. Before I do that, I want to give color about the third quarter, because I think it will give insight as to why I'm so bullish on our future. Since April, we've been focused on understanding where we are on the economic recovery curve. Some industries, such as CPG, pharma and healthcare were on the leading edge of that curve, as we would expect. In fact, some companies in those industries never fully shutdown their digital advertising campaigns. Others are a little farther back, restaurants and retailers, for example. They needed to advertise that they were open and message what their new normal looked like in terms of pickup and delivery services. However, their businesses have not yet completely returned to normal. And then further down the curve, of course, you have other industries like, auto and airlines and hospitality that remain in various early stages of recovery. My bullishness isn't because I think the macro environment is back to normal. We all know that's not true. Our positivity about our future is driven by the share gains that are happening during this time of uncertainty and the numbers show it. We've spoken in the past about our 95%-plus retention rate, and we're seeing no deviation from that. In fact, I would assert that customers are relying on us more and more. I see that not only in our growth numbers and the trends underneath those numbers, but also in the conversations that I'm having with advertisers every day. So, today, I'd like to break this discussion down in three ways. First, how we have seen advertisers become more deliberate in 2020 and what that's meant for us. Second, how the tipping point in TV has proven a major factor to our growth in 2020. And three, how all of this adds up to a few things that I'm most excited about for our future, especially starting in 2021. Let's start with the first item. Advertisers have become more deliberate. Brands and agencies that advertise more effectively, who leveraged data to be more nimble and agile are gaining share. In 2020, almost every marketer and every large brand is being asked to do more with less. Every advertising dollar has to be accounted for. CFOs are more involved in marketing and advertising decisions than they've been in years. They become a lot more focused on what business value is created by advertising. And that means that advertisers have to focus on ad opportunities that are measurable and comparable, where the business ROI can be understood and proven. As companies reactivated their ad campaigns, they had an opportunity to let the world know that they are still there and open for business and in what capacity. But because the world changed so fast in March and April, advertisers quickly realized that effective advertising requires new levels of agility. Now national brand campaigns had to be complimented by highly local campaigns specific to the circumstances in a particular region or state. But there was a much greater focus on reaching specific audiences with specific messages. The need for agility impacted more than campaign planning and management teams. Creative teams had to suddenly develop content in days versus months to take account for the constantly changing environment.  Combine those two factors, the need for new kinds of agility and the need to prove ROI. And you can recognize how marketers today need to not only be much more deliberate, but also much more data-driven. To some extent, this is history repeating itself. There are parallels to the 2008 and 2009 recession when programmatic advertising first came on the radar for most marketers. Back then display and mobile advertising were the big winners. They won despite being weaker at winning hearts and minds than video, TV or audio. They won share because they were measurable and comparable, and marketers can prove effectiveness with credibility. Fast forward 12 years to the present and digital is leading the way recovery, instead of just supplementing it. While marketers were incentive to dip their toes in the waters of data and data-driven advertising 12 years ago, today they are all in across all advertising channels. And for the first time, advertisers are aggressively committing to the Open Internet because of the scale and results of connected TV and premium video. I maintain my prediction that eventually all premium video will eventually make up about half of the global advertising pie. Now that advertisers can apply data to their premium video campaigns where hearts and minds are truly one, the long-term opportunity for The Trade Desk could not be more promising. Let me put some additional data behind these assertions. We recently surveyed more than 200 top advertisers, around 85% of them said they are under new pressure from CFOs to justify marketing spend and to measure against business goals. 50% are now having their typical measurement techniques questioned. As a result, almost all of them intend to adopt data-driven measurement strategies. This shift to being more deliberate has been a major driver of our growth this year. But we also see a play out in terms of business performance for those companies that prioritize data-driven advertising. And we see that industry-by-industry in consumer packaged goods, for example, those companies that maintain spend on our platform through the uncertainty performed better from a revenue growth perspective than those that slowed or suspended spending. Over the past three months, one CPG company lifted their same-store sales for one of their brands by over 40% utilizing a combination of CTV, mobile and PC advertising. We've seen similar patterns show up across industries, whether it's pharma or fast food or retail or technology. So, those companies that are advertising effectively are gaining share.  And as I said, if you want one particularly potent microcosm of this and our industry, you have only to look at what's happening within TV. Which brings me to my second point, how it 2020 will go down in media history as a tipping point in TV. Our CTV spend grew more than 100% year-over-year in the third quarter, as advertisers follow consumers to streaming platforms. That consumer shift has created a tipping point. The number of U.S. households with traditional cable TV subscription is dropping to below 80 million this year. According to eMarketer, 77.6 million U.S. households will have cable TV packages this year, down about 7.5% year-over-year. That is a rapid acceleration from the 3% decline that they had been predicting at the beginning of the year. In addition, CNBC recently reported that at least three large U.S. media companies expect the number of U.S. households that subscribed to linear TV bundles will fall to about 50 million in the next five years. That is about 40% drop from here. At the same time, advertisers will be able to reach more than 80 million U.S. households via CTV on our platform this year. The crossover at household reach on our platform versus linear TV bundles is only going to wide, and that's because on-demand streaming content is more convenient to viewers and because many U.S. households remain under considerable economic pressure and are abandoning their expensive cable TV packages. That live sports remain in a state of flux only adds to the acceleration in cord cutting. All of this, of course, has massive implications for broadcasters and advertisers. Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer at P&G, the world's largest advertiser, dropped a bombshell at the ANA conference a few weeks ago. He said that P&G would be moving away from the upfront model of TV ad buying. With TV advertising going digital, it makes no sense to make massive uninformed bets just because that's the way it's been done for decades. Now they can apply data to those decisions and be more deliberate. Relatedly, he also said that programmatic is their fastest growing advertising channel, which speaks to how P&G and other advertisers want to apply data and optimize campaigns across all channels. P&G is not alone, of course. Advertisers such as Unilever and MasterCard are calling for similar rethinks of archaic TV advertising processes. We are also seeing other brands move away from the upfront and look for more agile data-driven options. That's why we're working with our customers to create digital alternatives to processes such as the upfront, which can provide them with a more efficient data-driven and transparent forward market for TV inventory. While these shifts in the TV landscape may have taken a few years, in a normal business climate 2020 accelerated this disruption and innovation into a few months. This transformation of TV isn't the only reason I'm so confident about our growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond, which brings us to the third main topic I want to cover today. Why I am so bullish about our future? It is impossible to talk about the future of The Trade Desk or the future of the Open Internet without talking about connected TV. That's because the shift to CTV is helping reinforce advertiser conviction, that there is a compelling alternative to walled garden. Like last quarter, I have spent a disproportionate amount of my time over the past few months, meeting with agencies and brands. The first question invariably concerns helping them shift from user generated content intent to premium TV content, that's because they are increasingly wary of the divisive nature of UGC, as we discussed in our last quarters update. In fact, in that same survey of 200 advertisers, which I referenced earlier, 90% said they plan to shift ad dollars away from user generated content. Indeed, we have won tens of millions of dollars of spend from UGC platforms in the last quarter alone, and we expect these trends to continue. We're also winning business from linear TV and expect to continue to grab share from that $250 billion worldwide TV market. In the third quarter, one e-commerce giant saw an 11 times return on ad spend for CTV on our platform. As a result of that performance, they shifted 10% of their linear budget to CTV. We're seeing similar shifts across our customer base. But the other side of the CTV coin is the massive surge on the supply side. Broadcasters are all pivoting to CTV. If you listened to Lindy Yaccarino, Chairman of Advertising & Partnerships at NBCUniversal at our recent groundswell festival, you would have heard her talking about how the team TV model has changed permanently. She has working with advertisers in new ways to bridge the world of linear to the incremental reach of CTV, recognizing that they are no longer thinking about advertising in terms of particular content, but in terms of reaching a particular audience. By the way, we've heard the same refrain from all broadcasters, whether it's Disney or Hulu or Channel 4 in the U.K. or ProSieben in Germany and so on. As you know, over the last few years, we have invested heavily to be ready for this opportunity. Indeed, you've heard me say before that the last 10 years has been a dress rehearsal for this moment. Through our comprehensive CTV partnerships, we have access to pretty much all CTV inventory. And increasingly, these are partnerships that offer direct access to that inventory. This includes both broadcasters themselves, or partners such as Magnite or FreeWheel. Our customers are prioritizing these partnerships because they maximize yield management and provide transparent access to a wide range of broadcast or inventory. By contrast broadcast TV is a ticking time bomb, where the economics are unsustainable. The ad to content ratio creates a terrible viewer experience. The cost of cable for the consumer is high. So, not surprisingly the move to CTV is accelerating on the supplier side as well as on the consumer side. Another reason I'm so bullish for our future is product. In 2021, we will launch one of the biggest upgrades to our system in company history. The release is called Solomar [ph]. As some of you saw in 2018, we delivered a massive upgrade to our platform, which accelerated our market share gains. That one was called Next Wave. We are still relentlessly committed to innovating and staying on the leading edge of our industry. We never take leadership for granted, and we are always looking to improve our platform and deepen our relationships with our customers. Solomar will include a better user interface, one that brings all of our customers buying and planning tools together for greater ease-of-use. We're also making it easier than ever to onboard and deploy their first party data. We're improving data management, will continue to expand our identity products around the world, will make planning on our platform even better with a focus on ingesting and achieving customer specific goals and will release a meaningful integrated upgrade to Koa, the machine learning and AI engine that is always powering campaign, even if users are away from their keyboards. Finally, this launch will include a new measurement marketplace that provides advertisers with more transparent reporting. This represents an even more compelling measurement alternative to the walled gardens who continue to grade their own homework. Everything about this release points to the primacy of first party data and the ability to unlock the value of that data in an ad campaign, especially in connected TV. The third reason I'm so optimistic about our future is that we have deepened our relationships with brands. This is an addition to our core agency relationships. Brands understand they need to maximize the value of their first party data and scale its deployment across their marketing function. And increasingly, brands understand the power of data-driven advertising to drive growth. Programmatic is no longer simply a line item on the media plan. It's a central part of the planning process. In most cases, brands will continue to work hand in hand with their agencies, but the amount of brand resources applied to this is growing every quarter. Fourth, I'm very confident about our international growth. Early on in the pandemic, many of our international markets slowed down first. But since we started seeing the green shoots of recovery, many of them have returned to very healthy year-on-year growth, including Tokyo and Paris, which have grown spend over a 100% year-over-year. The same dynamics that are happening here in the U.S. are happening around the world. Innovation and disruption have been accelerated. And in many cases with their advertising ecosystems much more concentrated than in the United States, these markets have the opportunity to leap ahead quickly in areas such as CTV. Lastly, I'm extremely confident in CTV's future because of the industry wide movement that is galvanizing around the Open Internet. Even that phrase, the Open Internet was something that only a few of us were using with any confidence a few years ago, but it's now a movement that has gained considerable momentum. The most important manifestation of this is the collaboration that is now happening outside of the walled gardens. The likes of which we have never seen before. Brands are looking for alternatives to walled gardens and alternatives to user generated content and alternatives to broadcast TV and alternatives that are all data-driven. And, of course, alternatives that can be measured objectively. All of which point to the value of the Open Internet and all of which also mean that once again, the secular tailwinds are getting stronger for The Trade Desk. So, let me try to wrap this up by discussing some of the pressing items facing The Trade Desk and the Open Internet right now. I want to touch on the recent antitrust actions against Google. As many of you have asked about this, particularly in terms of what it might mean for us and the future of cookies. It is very difficult to predict what ultimately will transpire or what remedies might be, if any. All we do know is that it will likely take years. And that it will almost certainly create some level of distraction and change for Google. Ultimately, it doesn't change anything about our strategy. We are focused on offering a compelling alternative to walled garden. One that enables a free and better Open Internet for all participants, for advertisers, data providers, content providers, and consumers. We're trying to distribute power among the competitive media market, not control the market. And as we have seen this year, there is growing demand for such an alternative to walled gardens that can execute at scale across every channel worldwide. The market will not allow Google to be the only company to offer effective ad targeting. There is too much collaboration and understanding of what's at stake for that to happen. As a key element in creating that compelling alternative, we have architected a new identity framework for the entire Open Internet, called Unified ID 2.0. It raises all books [ph], simply put and creates a better and open competitive internet, one that also improves privacy controls for consumers. We have done this with the help and collaboration players across the Open Internet, including governing and regulating bodies, such as the IIB. Large publishers are implementing this solution now. Some of the biggest names on the internet are asking to be involved. The leaders of ad tech companies are working together to make this a success. This is much bigger than The Trade Desk. This is an industry-wide collaboration on a level that we have never seen before in our industry. Because of that, regardless of what Google ends up doing with cookies, we believe that the industry will have a better upgraded alternative for identity, that more effectively explains the value exchange of the internet and provides users with greater control and privacy. I firmly believe that Unified ID 2.0 will reach critical mass and adoption next year. And in doing so as an industry, we will have created a viable scale alternative to third-party cookies, one that is also browser and device agnostic. It's an upgrade across the board. The footprint of IDs that we're already working with is massive. In the last few days, you've heard that LiveRamp and Criteo will make their identity solutions interoperable with this. You've heard that Nielsen will be working with us to deploy Unified ID 2.0 for cross-channel measurement. And in the coming weeks, you'll start to hear from more advertisers and more publishers who are now part of this industry collaboration. If I could have fictionalized how this would go and the response from the market, I couldn't have written a more compelling story than what's actually happening. On a related note, I know some of you will have questions about Apple's recent moves regarding IDFA. We anticipate most users will ultimately opt in to IDFA in order to continue to enjoy personalization of apps across their devices. That includes things like Spotify, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Netflix, Facebook, or thousands of other apps. The last topic I would like to touch on is our most recent proxy filings. Our Board has proposed several amendments, which if approved would ultimately mean that our dual class stock structure will sunset or terminate in five years. I don't want to go over the proposal specifically here today. There'll be time to do that in another forum, but I would like to provide a little context as to why the Board has made this recommendation. Many of you have been with us for our entire four years as a public company. And in that time, we've significantly increased our market valuation by thousands of percentage points. In light of that growth, sometimes it's hard to remember, but if you catch your mind back four years, you'll recall that there was a lot of skepticism around our industry and around our prospects, ad tech as an industry was lowered on Wall Street. Over the last four years, we've delivered significant shareholder return, but we've brought a new level of appreciation and respect for our industry and our role in pioneering the future of media as well. It didn't happen overnight. We climbed out of that ad tech penalty box by making promises and setting expectations, and then meeting them consistently quarter after quarter, because we knew we needed to build your trust. And that trust helped us provide you with a consistent view of our long-term strategy. The trust between The Trade Desk and its shareholders is extremely important, because when you think about areas such as connected TV identity, upgrading our platform, international growth, these are not short-term or ad hoc decisions. These are decisions born of a long-term strategic plan. The next five years will be critical in our history, as advertisers increasingly consider the value of the Open Internet and embrace an alternative to the walled gardens. The next five years will go a long way in determining the winners and losers. Our Board has determined that these changes will enable the company to continue to have that long-term strategic focus. Maintaining that focus, maximizes our chances of continuing to deliver exceptional shareholder value. I just wanted to provide that brief context. As I know that many of you would appreciate that perspective, having been with us for the long haul. Now let me wrap up by coming back to where I started. We are highly encouraged by our strong performance in the third quarter. I have never been more proud of our team's performance than in this quarter. The team has done so much to set up our future and the future of the Open Internet. Because of that performance year-to-date, we're even more bullish about our ability to gain market share moving forward. Advertisers are becoming more deliberate with every ad dollar they spend and shifts in key channels, such as TV are only accelerating that trend. This makes our platform indispensable for our customers and partners. As Lindy Yaccarino said at our recent groundswell festival when asked about why she spent so much time with The Trade Desk, she said, and I quote, it's because they are leading me to the future. With that, let me hand it over to Blake to cover the financials.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to operate in an uncertain and challenging environment. However, as Jeff mentioned, we are seeing advertisers accelerate their shift to data-driven advertising in 2020. I'm really encouraged not only by this shift, but also by our company's execution during this period of uncertainty by working closely with our customers and our results demonstrate our solid operational performance. For Q3, revenue was $216 million, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. This represented a 45 percentage point acceleration from Q2. We benefited from several trends that helped us significantly exceed our expectations. One, existing advertisers shifted more spend to our platform during the quarter. This included CTV, which offers the ability for advertisers to apply data to their TV ad campaigns in ways that are simply not possible with linear. Two, we want a significant amount of new business from our competition, enabling us to gain share. And three, political spends steadily ramped up throughout the quarter and was particularly strong in the month of September. With the strong top line performance in Q3, we've generated $77 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 36% of revenue. As you have seen historically, when we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance dropped down to EBITDA, which it did in Q3. EBITDA also benefited temporarily lower than expected operating expense growth. From the channel perspective, in Q3, we continue to see improvements across all of our channels. For the quarter, spend in our mobile video, which includes connected TV, display, and audio channels all grew on a year-over-year basis. Connected TV spend was the strongest, run over 100% in Q3 on a year-over-year basis. Geographically in Q3, similar to last quarter, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. All of our major regions North America, APAC and Europe grew spend well into the double-digits year-over-year in Q3. In terms of our verticals that represented at least 1% of our spend, nearly every category improved during the quarter, with many exhibiting strong resilience in the face of the economic uncertainty that Jeff discussed. In particular, health and fitness, our largest vertical in 2019, as well as technology and computing, food and drink, and home and garden, all performed well.  Automotive showed consistent improvement as well during the quarter, ending with double-digit growth in Q3. Travel still remain negative on a year-over-year basis, but even that category showed relative improvement during the quarter and is improved on a year-over-year basis versus Q2 performance. Shopping also showed a noticeable turnaround in Q3, ending with growth well into the double-digits. And finally, as you can imagine, we have seen strong political spend in the month of September and also into October. However, it is fair to assume that we will still end 2020 as we had previously indicated, with political spend representing a mid single digit share as a percent of our spend. Operating expenses were $173 million in Q3, up 22% year-over-year. Although, faster than we invested in Q2, our operating expense growth was a bit lower than expected due to a number of factors. First, our employee support costs, including travel and corporate events, ran lower and or down materially from the prior year due to the virtual environment. Second, our bad debt expense for the quarter was lower than we had originally assumed, partially due to strong receivables health. The aging of our receivables actually improved slightly year-over-year despite the volatile economic environment, which we're obviously pleased with. Third, while we continue to produce positive net hiring every month and grew headcount in double-digits year-over-year in Q3, we did not ramp our hiring as quickly as we had hoped, also partially due to the virtual environment. Income tax expense was $1.3 million in the quarter, mainly due to the increase in profitability in the quarter, which was partially offset by employee stock-based awards. The timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $62.7 million or $1.27 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.5 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $66.5 million. The primary driver was the increase in net income and the change in working capital that can vary from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of payments and receivables. DSOs exit in the quarter were 101 days, up five days from a year ago. DPOs were 82 days, also up five days from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $557 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. In Q3, we paid down $70 million debt or about half of our revolving line of credit that we drew down against in the very early days of COVID-19 out of an abundance of caution. Since the end of Q3, we have paid down the remaining $72 million of our outstanding line. And as of today, we have no revolver debt on the balance sheet. I'm going to use the remainder of the time today to discuss Q4. Please be aware, our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has significantly impacted advertiser demand. Q4 has historically been our strongest quarter, driven by holiday ad spend. However, we continue to face a period of higher uncertainty in our business outlook. Assuming that the economy continues to improve, and we do not have any major COVID related setbacks that impact historically strong holiday ad spend, we estimate Q4 revenue to be between $287 million and $291 million, which would represent growth of between 33% to 35% on a year-over-year basis, a modest acceleration from our Q3 results. Under this assumption, we estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at least $115 million in Q4. I would remind you that the relative strengthened our EBITDA forecast is in part due to the virtual environment our teams are working in. While there is continued uncertainty about the economic environment, we are pleased with our momentum, and we remain highly optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for our business. We believe we have the structure in place to accelerate growth and scale our business efficiently, as economic conditions improve and are cautiously optimistic about continued measured improvement through Q4 and into 2021. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Levine with Pivotal Trade Group. Please go ahead. \nMichael Levine: Thanks for the question guys, and terrific results. So, just to dig in a little bit deeper, Jeff, on your comments around CTV, which were super helpful. Two parts. I mean, one, I'm curious if the weakness in linear sports TV ratings actually led to some acceleration. And I guess to secondarily, as your thinking about 2021, anything you guys could basically do to frame how investors should basically think about CTV growth?\nJeff Green: Yeah. Great. First of all, thanks for the question. Of course, there's no place in our business that we're more excited about than in CTV. And I think, it's difficult to argue that we didn't benefit from the struggle that live sports has had in 2020. In 2019, we just had this amazing sort of arm and arm tour with ESPN and just talking about the benefits of live sports. But while time consumption has gone up across the board on connected TV, consumption on both linear, as well as live sports has gone down dramatically, live sports suffering the most. When we asked in a survey, what was the number one reason that people hung on to cable? 60% of consumers said the reason for hanging onto it was live sports. And we think that that's the reason why when we asked them about cord cutting that they're doing that between two and a half and four times the rate that they've been doing that in the past. And that's in part because of just live sports being less compelling when there's not a crowd and it's not the same in this environment. So, we've definitely benefited from that. Will you remind me of the second part of your question?\nMichael Levine: Just some initial thoughts -- just how investors could think about the opportunity for CTV in 2021.\nJeff Green: Yeah. Absolutely. So, the first is just to touch on a little bit the upfront. So, this year, the upfront, which is a way that a lot of advertising spend in TV gets allocated was, especially weak, because just a lot of the decisions and meetings take place last week in March and first week in April, that was the moment that perhaps with the most amount of uncertainty in the global economy and certainly in the media landscape. I think most people -- part of the reason why I quoted Marc Pritchard on that really bold statement that he made that they plan to skip out on upfronts going forward, is in part because of the amount of uncertainty that the media landscape faces continuing going into 2021. What I think all of that means is the way to make television work and scale is going to be to move more to connected TV. I think it means that there's going to be more sold in what is effectively a spot market instead of on upfronts and all of that bodes well for us. That said, I think it's also important to note that we're investing in product to help digital participate in a new version of a forward market. And we're working with multiple players in the premium content space to define that. So, incredibly optimistic about our prospects in 2021 because of the secular tailwinds we have in TV for a variety of reasons, including the macro environment. \nMichael Levine: Terrific. Thanks again, Jeff.\nJeff Green: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question from Shyam Patil from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nShyam Patil: Hey, guys. Congrats on the impressive results. I have a couple of questions. First one, Jeff, you talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about Apple's upcoming IDFA change and how you guys plan to manage that change? And then Blake, I know you're not providing 2021 outlook yet. But are you able to talk a little bit about how you're thinking about areas of investment as well as how margins could trend next year? Thank you. \nJeff Green: Awesome. I'll take the first one and then Blake, if you want to take the lead on the second one, that'd be great. So, first, I'd like to answer the Apple IDFA question in two ways. First, let me just talk about from our company perspective, and then I just want to talk about it on behalf of the Open Internet and bigger perspective. So, about 10% of our spend uses IDFA, and because we've had limited targeting on that 10% for quite a long time continuing to limit it or limited in a new way, doesn't have a material impact to our business. Because we're looking at roughly 12 million ads every single second, when you take a million-ish of those and say, we're going to allow less data to be used on those. We just look more carefully for gems and the other 11 million. So, I don't expect it to have a material impact on our business the way that it will others. So, when you hear Facebook talk about having a big impact, just remember they're 70%-ish mobile, not 10% IDFA so, very different impact to us. That said, I do believe this is Apple trying to mess with Facebook's business and Google's business. They're much more committed, I think, to payment than they are to the advertising ecosystem. But one thing I just think has not been talked about enough is that when you limit the ability to use IDFA by all apps, not just for advertising, but for personalization, like in Netflix or Dropbox or so many others, what that is going to lead to is a massively deprecated consumer experience where consumers are then going to be asked the question, if you would like to upgrade your experience, you have to go to settings and change the following. I believe that that is inevitable, that because there's so much advantage to that personalization and there's so many companies that are committed to doing that in a fair, equitable, responsible way, including us. I believe we've already been through this with location on Apple, and it ended up people giving consent in the places that mattered so that they could have a better experience. I think long-term, we end up with people opting into IDFA and this not being a big setback for the industry of personalization. I don't expect that to happen. But I'll just go back to -- as it relates to us, it's a small portion of our business, given our focus on connected TV and being a gateway to all channels, not just one. Blake?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And I'll try to address this. And then Jeff, if you want to add anything, feel free at the end. With respect to the second question on thoughts around investment and margins, maybe some contexts that I can provide them may help. Just in general, we're very excited about the investment opportunities we have in front of us, whether that's in connected TV, international identity solutions or product development, such as Solomar that Jeff referenced, our focus is to drive investment in areas that drive platform spend growth. As we as we move into 2021, there's still lots of uncertainty around COVID and the macro economy. You saw the bit in Q3 areas like support costs, travel, events, and hiring, they're generally below pre-COVID levels. We're competent that when we do return to normal, whenever that is sometime in 2021, late 2021, 2022, your guess is as good as mine on that. Our margin structure should be as good as it was pre-COVID. And over the long run, as we continue to add scale potentially slightly better. But where I'd end that statement with is that please remember that we do not manage to an EBITDA target. We have areas that we are really excited about investing in and driving growth and we're always looking for those opportunities. So, if we can invest more that will drive future growth with the right long-term ROI, I will really advocate for it. And so just -- we always have to have that balanced perspective.\nJeff Green: I'll just add for 30 seconds. I was on the phone with some of our team in China this morning, just talking about how they are leading the world in global growth for us, they're back to the offices and sort of business as usual and having a phenomenal year for us. I definitely want to make investment there. I want to make investments in the forward market and CTV that we talked about. We talked about the momentum behind Unified ID, definitely a place that we can do more. We're planning the biggest release in our company's history next year in Solomar. There's just a lot of places for us to continue to grow. And we're still just in the very early innings of what is shaping out to be a huge game. So, just really excited, looking for places to make more investments.\nChris Toth: Next question, Chloe. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball. Please go ahead.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Good afternoon. Jeff, wanted to ask you to talk about the decision to deemphasize Amazon publishing services and favor working directly with the apps. I think you announced that several weeks ago. What was the aeration now to do this a little over a year after the PMP was set up? And does that change your approach to other streaming platforms such as Roku? So would appreciate your thoughts on this.\nJeff Green: You bet. So, first, the 2020 is the year where media does three years of worth of change in one year. So, while I had initially thought that this would last longer, I was extremely confident in it being important to our success in the short and medium term, but had less certainty about the long-term. Because of that, the partnership was an amazing success. We proved monetization on Amazon. We continue to monetize on Amazon. It's just not through Amazon published -- publishing services which it's my read that that's not the highest priority inside of Amazon. But instead getting access to the content that runs over Fire and Roku and every other device by creating closer relationships directly with the content owners. There is the same in TV, that content is king, and we continue to get closer to that content where they're more and more committed to doing yield management, either through a very close partner, like a FreeWheel or a Magnite, or doing it in some cases on their own. And we're okay, no matter what. We're sort of agnostic to how they want to do yield management as long as we plug in with them. But APS itself was less than 1.5% of all CTV ad impressions. So, meaning not necessarily Amazon, but those that came through Amazon publishing services. And so getting that more directly, it's actually better for us, better for our advertisers and deepens the relationship with the content owners. So by that measure, this was a smashing success.\nChris Toth: Next question, Chloe.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. \nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you. Hi, Jeff and Blake. Hope you're well. Congratulations on all the progress with the Unified ID 2.0 and getting closer to critical mass. My question is this, even with that degree of adoption there's some checks out there suggesting it's still going to be a lag time before ROI matches what previously existed under the third-party cookies. I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether an air pocket might exist? And how long you think it could take for us to start seeing the benefits of Unified ID play out both for your business and the Open Internet?\nJeff Green: You bet. So, first of all, thanks for the question. It's a somewhat complicated question in large part, because third-party cookies still exist, right? And they will for the next 18 months or so. So, everything that we do in the time between now and the time when they go away inside of Chrome, the Unified ID -- the Unified ID 2.0 is a supplement to the rest of it. Now that said, I believe we'll replace it before they go away. So, I believe that it will be the primary way that people are targeting on the Open Internet before third-party cookies go away. But as people are thinking about, what's the adoption looked like. Just think about the fact that, that LiveRamp and Criteo, and Nielsen have a pretty amazing footprint. And when they talk about interoperability and adoption, it's effectively pooling the footprint that we have of LiveRamp, Criteo, Nielsen and The Trade Desk to start, that's just the start. If I were to give you the list of all the people in media that are engaged with us and with all of us that are working on it, are all the people on the supply side that are working on this, it's actually overwhelming to just keep up with the amount of success. I have never seen anything like this in the history of the internet in terms of adoption. And I think it's just because we got the product right as an industry where we said, okay, we want an upgrade to cookies where it's encrypted. It has a terms of service so that it actually operates better. We get rid of the cookie mapping issues. It's a simple framework for publishers that can better explain the quid pro quo the internet. We're giving consumers better controls. There's this SSO that comes with it, so that people can consent one time per app and website validate their email address one time and then have effectively a pass to go all over the internet, so, with open path. So, I highlight those four components to this to just say, it's an upgrade across the board on all of those things. And especially when you take the momentum that's already there, there's not a good reason for any company not to sign up as that it benefits from this common currency, which has every advertiser, every publisher, even the consumer benefits from that. So, I think we figured out the way to make it a win-win across the board. And that's why the momentum is overwhelming. \nJustin Patterson: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tim Nolan with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nTim Nolan: Great. Thanks very much. Jeff, I have a question also about Unified ID. I hope it's a simple one. Could you help us understand a bit more what your partners are doing in this effort? You've mentioned now, and we've seen the releases in the last couple of weeks with LiveRamp and Criteo and Nielsen. Maybe, is it about them helping create and build the ID itself, or is it them agreeing to make their systems work with it? Just to understand a bit more what they are actually doing with you on that. And relatedly, I think, especially when it comes to Nielsen, you're talking about measurement a bit more I think on this call than you have in previous calls, what role does Unified ID 2.0, play in actually measuring media, especially CTV? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yeah. So, it's -- this is a complicated question. So in the third-party cookie universe, there is all this sinking that has to happen. So, if one company -- let's just say, Google has a cookie that says, and they identify a user as user ABC, and then Facebook has a cookie and they identify that user as one, two, three, in order for them to have a common understanding of the user, they have to pin each other. And so, when you see on the bottom of your browser, all the pixels loading constantly, it's all these companies thinking with each other so that they have a common understanding of the user and create a currency around the internet. What Unified ID 2.0 does, is it replaces that where there's constantly pings happening and sinking, so that there's a common understanding of the user and replaces it with a standard that we all have. And this effectively creates a currency for the internet. It doesn't mean that we aggregate all the data. In fact, it's liberally designed to avoid that. There is this ID where there's no data per se, attached to it. And then the individual companies themselves that have in proper ways gained insight or data, then can use that in their own four walls without having to send the data to all different places. Because everybody has an interest in creating this understanding so we can stop sinking and have a better system. We basically took a recipe from the IAB -- for the IAB has said, this is what the best solution should look like. And we just went one click down on fleshing that out. And then we sent it out to partners like Criteo and like -- which incidentally is a competitor in a lot of levels, but we felt like it was very important to start there so that we were signifying to the industry that this was a collaboration, even though we compete then we did the exact same thing with LiveRamp to just make certain that it was interoperable.  So, you asked whether it was about interoperability or about collaboration, it is about both. But we took something to them that was mostly baked and said, what do we need to modify to get you to adopt it and make it interoperable with your solutions? And that's where we are with all of them. You mentioned measurement. You're absolutely right. One of the things that I think Facebook and Google have done really well and becoming as big as they are in advertising is that they have done a good job of taking credit for what happens in all of advertising, because they touch so many conversions. When they sell something, they're effectively providing analytics to say, yes, we touched it. You sold that product because of us. The Open Internet needs to do a better job of showing the role that it plays, especially given that I believe most hearts and minds are one in things like CTV and audio. So, we need to integrate with the best measurement solutions in the world. You're going to hear a lot more from us about measurement over the next year and about partnerships that we're initiating to make that better. But there's no place better to start than with Nielsen, who's effectively been the gold standard of TV measurement for decades.\nChris Toth: Next question, Chloe.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much and congrats on that really impressive quarter. Jeff, I was just wondering -- so two questions for you. One, how are the potential changes in the political environment could impact -- how are they potentially impacting your ecosystem, especially around what's happening with the walled gardens, with the change in the guards, have a material impact one way or another. And then on a topic that you mentioned briefly earlier, which is China. This was a topic that you stack a lot, a lot more about. It seems like China is now on the other side of this COVID, they've opened up. Their growth has been very, very impressive. How are you looking at that business from a contribution standpoint? I think 2021 was going to be a year where China was going to be starting to basically move the needle. I'm sorry, 2020 was a year where China was going to start moving the needle for you. Well, 2021 will now be that year? Thank you. \nJeff Green: Great. So, first as it relates to the political environment, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume you just mean that amount of scrutiny that -- as I call it big tack is under right now, as that continues.\nYoussef Squali: Right. Right. Potentially worsens, how does that play in your favor potentially or not?\nJeff Green: So, I don't think that it will affect us all of that much. But it -- whatever effect that has is likely to be positive. And here's why -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think adding pressure to Google and especially having lived through sort of the other side of antitrust with -- when I was at Microsoft, more than 10 years ago, the level of scrutiny that I think big tech is under is likely to make the Googles of the world slowdown, be a little more careful dot the I's and cross T's to make certain that they're not violating antitrust. It could likely mean that they make changes to pricing tactics and it could mean that they are less aggressive in going after targeting, even if it is in the name of privacy. So that only they would be the ones to target on the other side of that, if the collective Open Internet didn't work together. So, because of that pressure, I anticipate that we'll see some small benefit. But here's I think the most important thing that I can say on this topic. We were fine with the landscape the way it was. We built a business from the very beginning, that was built on objectivity and we wanted to focus on the demand side so that people knew what we were. And we were to some extent 10 years ago or rebuttal to Google's business model to be involved in every part of the ad tech stack. And instead, we just said, we were going to focus on the buy side, because with that came a level of transparency and objectivity that we knew someone in Google's position could never provide. So, if they have to slowdown, great. If they don't, that's fine. We're going to keep talking about the exact same principles that got us here, and we believe we're more likely to win now than we were 11 years ago and happy to keep going.\nChris Toth: Thank you, Jeff. Next question, Chloe.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mark with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thank you. Hi, Jeff. I appreciate all the color on UID. A lot of excitement and anxiousness, I would say in the industry, as we talked to lots of the companies involved. I'm just curious, if we think about perhaps milestones over the next 12 months, that will indicate that we are trending in the right direction here to fully replace the scale that Chrome cookies offers. Can you maybe talk about a few milestones that we should look for? And then what do you anticipate to be the primary asks of all the parties that are involved here and whether or not the bigger asks will come from the bigger publishers, if I'm thinking about that correctly? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yeah. So, the milestones are mostly measured in interoperability. So, as a publisher or an advertiser says, we want to leverage this to create interoperability between our ID and somebody else's ID. And there are lots of ID initiatives out there. Nearly every agency has one that they're pursuing. Many of them have been pursuing them for multiple years. Those are all different. Most of those are similar to LiveRamp where they're about data onboarding and making it possible for people to use the data that otherwise has not been. That's different than creating a currency, which is all about interoperability. So, every time you see a press release or you see somebody publicly saying we are making our ID interoperable, you're just sort of joining the circles of what otherwise would have been a Venn diagram in the cookie world to just make a bigger circle. And so the thing to be looking for is interoperability. Did I answer the second part of his question?\nChris Toth: Yeah. Did we catch that Mark? Okay. We will answer. You said that he had a second part of his question regarding China. And so, Jeff will take that question right now.\nJeff Green: Great. So, you're absolutely right that we've had high hopes in China for a very long time. We've also been making investments for a few years now. Rather than just quantify when it's going to move the needle, especially as that becomes a bigger target as we continue to grow our business around the world, I'll just reiterate China is leading the world right now for us in terms of growth rate. The green shoots are really remarkable in 2020. I don't know that I would've pointed to the green shoots in years before this year. But they're really remarkable. We continue to just build out the team and build out the products that we need. Our vision is to do for the Chinese speaking world, what we've done for the English speaking world. If you look at like the places where we've had the most amount of growth the countries that we've talked most about in connected TV, it's been in the English speaking world, whether that's in Australia or in London, or in -- of course, the United States. It doesn't mean that we haven't had great success in places like Germany and other places as well, but it's been predominantly English. We think there's something very similar to be done in the Chinese speaking world, which goes beyond just greater China. And we're seeing those green shoots in 2020. So, it's one of the places that I'm interested in making investments in and spending more time in and really eager for the world to get back to some sort of normal. So, I can go back and spend more time in a place I fell in love with it.\nChris Toth: And Chloe will take -- we have time for one more question, and then we'll close it out.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Egbert with Stifel. Please go ahead. \nJohn Egbert: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, it seems like in addition to being a far more efficient channel for large brands than linear TV advertising, CTV seems really tailor made for premium video ads from SMBs and mid-market retailers that never really bought TV ads at a national level, would be the factors like budget limitations, or narrower geographic focus. And these companies are arguably among the largest drivers of digital ad demand today and driving most of the growth for the walled gardens right now. So, I guess, two questions. First, are you working with many companies in these categories through our agency relationships today? And I guess, looking maybe a few years out is your penetration within large advertiser and agency budgets continues to grow, would you consider developing products that better cater to the segment? And I guess, if so, what are some of the challenges to consider there?\nJeff Green: Yeah. So, I could not agree more with the premise of the question, which is that SMBs and mid-market advertisers have been driver of digital, especially for companies like Google and Facebook. We, of course, have done much better among the premium brands and deliberately started there and that continues to be the core of the market that we service. But we fully acknowledge. When we talk about a trillion dollar TAM and we talk about being focused on the demand side so that we can appeal to everybody, that objectivity and that TAM has to include advertisers of smaller sizes. The way that we service those today is largely through agencies and other tech providers that are very focused on servicing those advertisers today. There might be a time down the road that we do some of that ourselves without trying to disintermediate any of them would be the hope. But there's a lot to consider there. You asked what are the considerations? You have to have a relationship that is almost like a B2C relationship in order to service those which, I think it's just really important for us to think about as we continue to expand. So, those things are not lost on us. We're spending a lot of time trying to learn more about that market, but we continue to be focused on that trillion dollar TAM and no, we can't ignore it. \nChris Toth: All right. Last question, Chloe.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. \nBrian Schwartz: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. I've got a question for Blake on the EBITDA margin trajectory. If I look at the second half of this year, you're going to put up about 400 bips of improvement year-over-year and that probably is somewhat on sustainable. I wanted to ask you whether your comments about the lower OpEx growth that you expected in the current quarter and the uptick in investments was intended to perhaps suggest some restraint when we're thinking about that EBITDA margin trajectory. Again, I'm not asking firm margin guidance for next year. I know that will probably come later. But just directionally, how has the experience with COVID and the cost structure? How has that changed if at all your view of the EBITDA margin for trajectory coming out of the pandemic? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Thanks. And I'll try to provide a little more perspective. I think, obviously, in Q3, we've seen the impact. What I refer to as the virtual environment, lower support costs in travel, corporate events, things like that. I mean, it's not just lower than quarter-over-quarter, but it's down significantly year-on-year. I think that -- and then you can obviously look at our EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter and infer in there some sense of continuation of that in those numbers themselves. I think the thing, as far as like thinking about it into the future it goes, one of the reasons why we're able to run with a lower cost base today is that we're in this virtual environment -- our customers are in this virtual environment along with us. We are here to serve our customers and meet with them and help them in any way we can. And so if and when behavior changes on a macro basis, we'll adapt accordingly. But I don't expect that personally. Now the question is the timing of when is everybody's got their own guests and none of us are going to be right about that, the timing of it. But I think it's one of those things. I think where we begin to see benefits on margins and I talked about this a little bit earlier in my answer, I think before is just with scale. As we just got larger and larger, we can gain scale. We should be able to gain efficiencies. But as far as like near term components, that's about the way that I'm thinking. I hope that helps.\nOperator: It does appear we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Chris Toth for any closing remarks.\nChris Toth: Thank you, Chloe. Thank you everyone for joining. I know we ran a few minutes out over the top of the hour, but really good questions, and thanks everyone for joining. We look forward to speaking to you over the remainder of the quarter. Good night, everyone.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Hello everyone and thank you for joining us. We are excited to announce the results of our third quarter. Despite the headwinds of a global pandemic, we had healthy growth in the third quarter, up 32% year-over-year, far surpassing our own expectations.  As we discussed, 2020 is a year where agility matters more than ever. In this environment, marketers have come to more fully appreciate the power of data-driven advertising. And as that happens, we are becoming indispensable. We have developed closer relationships with the biggest brands and agencies in the world, and we are winning more business, with both new and existing customers. In addition, we continue to see rapid growth in key channels, such as connected TV, which grew more than 100% year-over-year. This was a very encouraging quarter, not only in terms of our revenue and market share growth, but also what it signals about our growth opportunity moving forward. While our growth is very encouraging, we are still operating at a time of great uncertainty for many industries, but even in the midst of that uncertainty, we are clear that our role is to help our customers drive economic recovery. Advertising is an engine of economic growth, and our customers know that their campaigns can fuel growth and drive market share gains for their brands. And because of that, during times of uncertainty, they become much more deliberate.  That's not to say this is a straight line recovery for our customers. It's not. Often our customers are still being hurt by the global pandemic and the economic consequences of most people staying home. But while we are a long way from being completely out of the woods, I do believe that in 2020, so far, we have gained more market share or said another way grabbed more land than at any point in our company's history. We've accomplished this because advertisers have become more deliberate, and we are a part of the solution that helps them manage uncertainty and chart a path to grow. Our rate of grabbing land in Q3 might be the biggest bullish indicator we produced as a publicly traded company. Market share gains in 2020 is a testament to the strength of our value proposition and our customer relationship. That's what makes me more proud of our performance in the third quarter than any other quarter in The Trade Desk's history. Our team navigated uncertainty and helped the most sophisticated advertisers fuel their recovery, with new approaches to channels such as CTV. I'll come back to CTV in a few minutes. Before I do that, I want to give color about the third quarter, because I think it will give insight as to why I'm so bullish on our future. Since April, we've been focused on understanding where we are on the economic recovery curve. Some industries, such as CPG, pharma and healthcare were on the leading edge of that curve, as we would expect. In fact, some companies in those industries never fully shutdown their digital advertising campaigns. Others are a little farther back, restaurants and retailers, for example. They needed to advertise that they were open and message what their new normal looked like in terms of pickup and delivery services. However, their businesses have not yet completely returned to normal. And then further down the curve, of course, you have other industries like, auto and airlines and hospitality that remain in various early stages of recovery. My bullishness isn't because I think the macro environment is back to normal. We all know that's not true. Our positivity about our future is driven by the share gains that are happening during this time of uncertainty and the numbers show it. We've spoken in the past about our 95%-plus retention rate, and we're seeing no deviation from that. In fact, I would assert that customers are relying on us more and more. I see that not only in our growth numbers and the trends underneath those numbers, but also in the conversations that I'm having with advertisers every day. So, today, I'd like to break this discussion down in three ways. First, how we have seen advertisers become more deliberate in 2020 and what that's meant for us. Second, how the tipping point in TV has proven a major factor to our growth in 2020. And three, how all of this adds up to a few things that I'm most excited about for our future, especially starting in 2021. Let's start with the first item. Advertisers have become more deliberate. Brands and agencies that advertise more effectively, who leveraged data to be more nimble and agile are gaining share. In 2020, almost every marketer and every large brand is being asked to do more with less. Every advertising dollar has to be accounted for. CFOs are more involved in marketing and advertising decisions than they've been in years. They become a lot more focused on what business value is created by advertising. And that means that advertisers have to focus on ad opportunities that are measurable and comparable, where the business ROI can be understood and proven. As companies reactivated their ad campaigns, they had an opportunity to let the world know that they are still there and open for business and in what capacity. But because the world changed so fast in March and April, advertisers quickly realized that effective advertising requires new levels of agility. Now national brand campaigns had to be complimented by highly local campaigns specific to the circumstances in a particular region or state. But there was a much greater focus on reaching specific audiences with specific messages. The need for agility impacted more than campaign planning and management teams. Creative teams had to suddenly develop content in days versus months to take account for the constantly changing environment.  Combine those two factors, the need for new kinds of agility and the need to prove ROI. And you can recognize how marketers today need to not only be much more deliberate, but also much more data-driven. To some extent, this is history repeating itself. There are parallels to the 2008 and 2009 recession when programmatic advertising first came on the radar for most marketers. Back then display and mobile advertising were the big winners. They won despite being weaker at winning hearts and minds than video, TV or audio. They won share because they were measurable and comparable, and marketers can prove effectiveness with credibility. Fast forward 12 years to the present and digital is leading the way recovery, instead of just supplementing it. While marketers were incentive to dip their toes in the waters of data and data-driven advertising 12 years ago, today they are all in across all advertising channels. And for the first time, advertisers are aggressively committing to the Open Internet because of the scale and results of connected TV and premium video. I maintain my prediction that eventually all premium video will eventually make up about half of the global advertising pie. Now that advertisers can apply data to their premium video campaigns where hearts and minds are truly one, the long-term opportunity for The Trade Desk could not be more promising. Let me put some additional data behind these assertions. We recently surveyed more than 200 top advertisers, around 85% of them said they are under new pressure from CFOs to justify marketing spend and to measure against business goals. 50% are now having their typical measurement techniques questioned. As a result, almost all of them intend to adopt data-driven measurement strategies. This shift to being more deliberate has been a major driver of our growth this year. But we also see a play out in terms of business performance for those companies that prioritize data-driven advertising. And we see that industry-by-industry in consumer packaged goods, for example, those companies that maintain spend on our platform through the uncertainty performed better from a revenue growth perspective than those that slowed or suspended spending. Over the past three months, one CPG company lifted their same-store sales for one of their brands by over 40% utilizing a combination of CTV, mobile and PC advertising. We've seen similar patterns show up across industries, whether it's pharma or fast food or retail or technology. So, those companies that are advertising effectively are gaining share.  And as I said, if you want one particularly potent microcosm of this and our industry, you have only to look at what's happening within TV. Which brings me to my second point, how it 2020 will go down in media history as a tipping point in TV. Our CTV spend grew more than 100% year-over-year in the third quarter, as advertisers follow consumers to streaming platforms. That consumer shift has created a tipping point. The number of U.S. households with traditional cable TV subscription is dropping to below 80 million this year. According to eMarketer, 77.6 million U.S. households will have cable TV packages this year, down about 7.5% year-over-year. That is a rapid acceleration from the 3% decline that they had been predicting at the beginning of the year. In addition, CNBC recently reported that at least three large U.S. media companies expect the number of U.S. households that subscribed to linear TV bundles will fall to about 50 million in the next five years. That is about 40% drop from here. At the same time, advertisers will be able to reach more than 80 million U.S. households via CTV on our platform this year. The crossover at household reach on our platform versus linear TV bundles is only going to wide, and that's because on-demand streaming content is more convenient to viewers and because many U.S. households remain under considerable economic pressure and are abandoning their expensive cable TV packages. That live sports remain in a state of flux only adds to the acceleration in cord cutting. All of this, of course, has massive implications for broadcasters and advertisers. Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer at P&G, the world's largest advertiser, dropped a bombshell at the ANA conference a few weeks ago. He said that P&G would be moving away from the upfront model of TV ad buying. With TV advertising going digital, it makes no sense to make massive uninformed bets just because that's the way it's been done for decades. Now they can apply data to those decisions and be more deliberate. Relatedly, he also said that programmatic is their fastest growing advertising channel, which speaks to how P&G and other advertisers want to apply data and optimize campaigns across all channels. P&G is not alone, of course. Advertisers such as Unilever and MasterCard are calling for similar rethinks of archaic TV advertising processes. We are also seeing other brands move away from the upfront and look for more agile data-driven options. That's why we're working with our customers to create digital alternatives to processes such as the upfront, which can provide them with a more efficient data-driven and transparent forward market for TV inventory. While these shifts in the TV landscape may have taken a few years, in a normal business climate 2020 accelerated this disruption and innovation into a few months. This transformation of TV isn't the only reason I'm so confident about our growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond, which brings us to the third main topic I want to cover today. Why I am so bullish about our future? It is impossible to talk about the future of The Trade Desk or the future of the Open Internet without talking about connected TV. That's because the shift to CTV is helping reinforce advertiser conviction, that there is a compelling alternative to walled garden. Like last quarter, I have spent a disproportionate amount of my time over the past few months, meeting with agencies and brands. The first question invariably concerns helping them shift from user generated content intent to premium TV content, that's because they are increasingly wary of the divisive nature of UGC, as we discussed in our last quarters update. In fact, in that same survey of 200 advertisers, which I referenced earlier, 90% said they plan to shift ad dollars away from user generated content. Indeed, we have won tens of millions of dollars of spend from UGC platforms in the last quarter alone, and we expect these trends to continue. We're also winning business from linear TV and expect to continue to grab share from that $250 billion worldwide TV market. In the third quarter, one e-commerce giant saw an 11 times return on ad spend for CTV on our platform. As a result of that performance, they shifted 10% of their linear budget to CTV. We're seeing similar shifts across our customer base. But the other side of the CTV coin is the massive surge on the supply side. Broadcasters are all pivoting to CTV. If you listened to Lindy Yaccarino, Chairman of Advertising & Partnerships at NBCUniversal at our recent groundswell festival, you would have heard her talking about how the team TV model has changed permanently. She has working with advertisers in new ways to bridge the world of linear to the incremental reach of CTV, recognizing that they are no longer thinking about advertising in terms of particular content, but in terms of reaching a particular audience. By the way, we've heard the same refrain from all broadcasters, whether it's Disney or Hulu or Channel 4 in the U.K. or ProSieben in Germany and so on. As you know, over the last few years, we have invested heavily to be ready for this opportunity. Indeed, you've heard me say before that the last 10 years has been a dress rehearsal for this moment. Through our comprehensive CTV partnerships, we have access to pretty much all CTV inventory. And increasingly, these are partnerships that offer direct access to that inventory. This includes both broadcasters themselves, or partners such as Magnite or FreeWheel. Our customers are prioritizing these partnerships because they maximize yield management and provide transparent access to a wide range of broadcast or inventory. By contrast broadcast TV is a ticking time bomb, where the economics are unsustainable. The ad to content ratio creates a terrible viewer experience. The cost of cable for the consumer is high. So, not surprisingly the move to CTV is accelerating on the supplier side as well as on the consumer side. Another reason I'm so bullish for our future is product. In 2021, we will launch one of the biggest upgrades to our system in company history. The release is called Solomar [ph]. As some of you saw in 2018, we delivered a massive upgrade to our platform, which accelerated our market share gains. That one was called Next Wave. We are still relentlessly committed to innovating and staying on the leading edge of our industry. We never take leadership for granted, and we are always looking to improve our platform and deepen our relationships with our customers. Solomar will include a better user interface, one that brings all of our customers buying and planning tools together for greater ease-of-use. We're also making it easier than ever to onboard and deploy their first party data. We're improving data management, will continue to expand our identity products around the world, will make planning on our platform even better with a focus on ingesting and achieving customer specific goals and will release a meaningful integrated upgrade to Koa, the machine learning and AI engine that is always powering campaign, even if users are away from their keyboards. Finally, this launch will include a new measurement marketplace that provides advertisers with more transparent reporting. This represents an even more compelling measurement alternative to the walled gardens who continue to grade their own homework. Everything about this release points to the primacy of first party data and the ability to unlock the value of that data in an ad campaign, especially in connected TV. The third reason I'm so optimistic about our future is that we have deepened our relationships with brands. This is an addition to our core agency relationships. Brands understand they need to maximize the value of their first party data and scale its deployment across their marketing function. And increasingly, brands understand the power of data-driven advertising to drive growth. Programmatic is no longer simply a line item on the media plan. It's a central part of the planning process. In most cases, brands will continue to work hand in hand with their agencies, but the amount of brand resources applied to this is growing every quarter. Fourth, I'm very confident about our international growth. Early on in the pandemic, many of our international markets slowed down first. But since we started seeing the green shoots of recovery, many of them have returned to very healthy year-on-year growth, including Tokyo and Paris, which have grown spend over a 100% year-over-year. The same dynamics that are happening here in the U.S. are happening around the world. Innovation and disruption have been accelerated. And in many cases with their advertising ecosystems much more concentrated than in the United States, these markets have the opportunity to leap ahead quickly in areas such as CTV. Lastly, I'm extremely confident in CTV's future because of the industry wide movement that is galvanizing around the Open Internet. Even that phrase, the Open Internet was something that only a few of us were using with any confidence a few years ago, but it's now a movement that has gained considerable momentum. The most important manifestation of this is the collaboration that is now happening outside of the walled gardens. The likes of which we have never seen before. Brands are looking for alternatives to walled gardens and alternatives to user generated content and alternatives to broadcast TV and alternatives that are all data-driven. And, of course, alternatives that can be measured objectively. All of which point to the value of the Open Internet and all of which also mean that once again, the secular tailwinds are getting stronger for The Trade Desk. So, let me try to wrap this up by discussing some of the pressing items facing The Trade Desk and the Open Internet right now. I want to touch on the recent antitrust actions against Google. As many of you have asked about this, particularly in terms of what it might mean for us and the future of cookies. It is very difficult to predict what ultimately will transpire or what remedies might be, if any. All we do know is that it will likely take years. And that it will almost certainly create some level of distraction and change for Google. Ultimately, it doesn't change anything about our strategy. We are focused on offering a compelling alternative to walled garden. One that enables a free and better Open Internet for all participants, for advertisers, data providers, content providers, and consumers. We're trying to distribute power among the competitive media market, not control the market. And as we have seen this year, there is growing demand for such an alternative to walled gardens that can execute at scale across every channel worldwide. The market will not allow Google to be the only company to offer effective ad targeting. There is too much collaboration and understanding of what's at stake for that to happen. As a key element in creating that compelling alternative, we have architected a new identity framework for the entire Open Internet, called Unified ID 2.0. It raises all books [ph], simply put and creates a better and open competitive internet, one that also improves privacy controls for consumers. We have done this with the help and collaboration players across the Open Internet, including governing and regulating bodies, such as the IIB. Large publishers are implementing this solution now. Some of the biggest names on the internet are asking to be involved. The leaders of ad tech companies are working together to make this a success. This is much bigger than The Trade Desk. This is an industry-wide collaboration on a level that we have never seen before in our industry. Because of that, regardless of what Google ends up doing with cookies, we believe that the industry will have a better upgraded alternative for identity, that more effectively explains the value exchange of the internet and provides users with greater control and privacy. I firmly believe that Unified ID 2.0 will reach critical mass and adoption next year. And in doing so as an industry, we will have created a viable scale alternative to third-party cookies, one that is also browser and device agnostic. It's an upgrade across the board. The footprint of IDs that we're already working with is massive. In the last few days, you've heard that LiveRamp and Criteo will make their identity solutions interoperable with this. You've heard that Nielsen will be working with us to deploy Unified ID 2.0 for cross-channel measurement. And in the coming weeks, you'll start to hear from more advertisers and more publishers who are now part of this industry collaboration. If I could have fictionalized how this would go and the response from the market, I couldn't have written a more compelling story than what's actually happening. On a related note, I know some of you will have questions about Apple's recent moves regarding IDFA. We anticipate most users will ultimately opt in to IDFA in order to continue to enjoy personalization of apps across their devices. That includes things like Spotify, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Netflix, Facebook, or thousands of other apps. The last topic I would like to touch on is our most recent proxy filings. Our Board has proposed several amendments, which if approved would ultimately mean that our dual class stock structure will sunset or terminate in five years. I don't want to go over the proposal specifically here today. There'll be time to do that in another forum, but I would like to provide a little context as to why the Board has made this recommendation. Many of you have been with us for our entire four years as a public company. And in that time, we've significantly increased our market valuation by thousands of percentage points. In light of that growth, sometimes it's hard to remember, but if you catch your mind back four years, you'll recall that there was a lot of skepticism around our industry and around our prospects, ad tech as an industry was lowered on Wall Street. Over the last four years, we've delivered significant shareholder return, but we've brought a new level of appreciation and respect for our industry and our role in pioneering the future of media as well. It didn't happen overnight. We climbed out of that ad tech penalty box by making promises and setting expectations, and then meeting them consistently quarter after quarter, because we knew we needed to build your trust. And that trust helped us provide you with a consistent view of our long-term strategy. The trust between The Trade Desk and its shareholders is extremely important, because when you think about areas such as connected TV identity, upgrading our platform, international growth, these are not short-term or ad hoc decisions. These are decisions born of a long-term strategic plan. The next five years will be critical in our history, as advertisers increasingly consider the value of the Open Internet and embrace an alternative to the walled gardens. The next five years will go a long way in determining the winners and losers. Our Board has determined that these changes will enable the company to continue to have that long-term strategic focus. Maintaining that focus, maximizes our chances of continuing to deliver exceptional shareholder value. I just wanted to provide that brief context. As I know that many of you would appreciate that perspective, having been with us for the long haul. Now let me wrap up by coming back to where I started. We are highly encouraged by our strong performance in the third quarter. I have never been more proud of our team's performance than in this quarter. The team has done so much to set up our future and the future of the Open Internet. Because of that performance year-to-date, we're even more bullish about our ability to gain market share moving forward. Advertisers are becoming more deliberate with every ad dollar they spend and shifts in key channels, such as TV are only accelerating that trend. This makes our platform indispensable for our customers and partners. As Lindy Yaccarino said at our recent groundswell festival when asked about why she spent so much time with The Trade Desk, she said, and I quote, it's because they are leading me to the future. With that, let me hand it over to Blake to cover the financials. Yeah. Great. First of all, thanks for the question. Of course, there's no place in our business that we're more excited about than in CTV. And I think, it's difficult to argue that we didn't benefit from the struggle that live sports has had in 2020. In 2019, we just had this amazing sort of arm and arm tour with ESPN and just talking about the benefits of live sports. But while time consumption has gone up across the board on connected TV, consumption on both linear, as well as live sports has gone down dramatically, live sports suffering the most. When we asked in a survey, what was the number one reason that people hung on to cable? 60% of consumers said the reason for hanging onto it was live sports. And we think that that's the reason why when we asked them about cord cutting that they're doing that between two and a half and four times the rate that they've been doing that in the past. And that's in part because of just live sports being less compelling when there's not a crowd and it's not the same in this environment. So, we've definitely benefited from that. Will you remind me of the second part of your question? Yeah. Absolutely. So, the first is just to touch on a little bit the upfront. So, this year, the upfront, which is a way that a lot of advertising spend in TV gets allocated was, especially weak, because just a lot of the decisions and meetings take place last week in March and first week in April, that was the moment that perhaps with the most amount of uncertainty in the global economy and certainly in the media landscape. I think most people -- part of the reason why I quoted Marc Pritchard on that really bold statement that he made that they plan to skip out on upfronts going forward, is in part because of the amount of uncertainty that the media landscape faces continuing going into 2021. What I think all of that means is the way to make television work and scale is going to be to move more to connected TV. I think it means that there's going to be more sold in what is effectively a spot market instead of on upfronts and all of that bodes well for us. That said, I think it's also important to note that we're investing in product to help digital participate in a new version of a forward market. And we're working with multiple players in the premium content space to define that. So, incredibly optimistic about our prospects in 2021 because of the secular tailwinds we have in TV for a variety of reasons, including the macro environment. Thank you. Awesome. I'll take the first one and then Blake, if you want to take the lead on the second one, that'd be great. So, first, I'd like to answer the Apple IDFA question in two ways. First, let me just talk about from our company perspective, and then I just want to talk about it on behalf of the Open Internet and bigger perspective. So, about 10% of our spend uses IDFA, and because we've had limited targeting on that 10% for quite a long time continuing to limit it or limited in a new way, doesn't have a material impact to our business. Because we're looking at roughly 12 million ads every single second, when you take a million-ish of those and say, we're going to allow less data to be used on those. We just look more carefully for gems and the other 11 million. So, I don't expect it to have a material impact on our business the way that it will others. So, when you hear Facebook talk about having a big impact, just remember they're 70%-ish mobile, not 10% IDFA so, very different impact to us. That said, I do believe this is Apple trying to mess with Facebook's business and Google's business. They're much more committed, I think, to payment than they are to the advertising ecosystem. But one thing I just think has not been talked about enough is that when you limit the ability to use IDFA by all apps, not just for advertising, but for personalization, like in Netflix or Dropbox or so many others, what that is going to lead to is a massively deprecated consumer experience where consumers are then going to be asked the question, if you would like to upgrade your experience, you have to go to settings and change the following. I believe that that is inevitable, that because there's so much advantage to that personalization and there's so many companies that are committed to doing that in a fair, equitable, responsible way, including us. I believe we've already been through this with location on Apple, and it ended up people giving consent in the places that mattered so that they could have a better experience. I think long-term, we end up with people opting into IDFA and this not being a big setback for the industry of personalization. I don't expect that to happen. But I'll just go back to -- as it relates to us, it's a small portion of our business, given our focus on connected TV and being a gateway to all channels, not just one. Blake? I'll just add for 30 seconds. I was on the phone with some of our team in China this morning, just talking about how they are leading the world in global growth for us, they're back to the offices and sort of business as usual and having a phenomenal year for us. I definitely want to make investment there. I want to make investments in the forward market and CTV that we talked about. We talked about the momentum behind Unified ID, definitely a place that we can do more. We're planning the biggest release in our company's history next year in Solomar. There's just a lot of places for us to continue to grow. And we're still just in the very early innings of what is shaping out to be a huge game. So, just really excited, looking for places to make more investments. You bet. So, first, the 2020 is the year where media does three years of worth of change in one year. So, while I had initially thought that this would last longer, I was extremely confident in it being important to our success in the short and medium term, but had less certainty about the long-term. Because of that, the partnership was an amazing success. We proved monetization on Amazon. We continue to monetize on Amazon. It's just not through Amazon published -- publishing services which it's my read that that's not the highest priority inside of Amazon. But instead getting access to the content that runs over Fire and Roku and every other device by creating closer relationships directly with the content owners. There is the same in TV, that content is king, and we continue to get closer to that content where they're more and more committed to doing yield management, either through a very close partner, like a FreeWheel or a Magnite, or doing it in some cases on their own. And we're okay, no matter what. We're sort of agnostic to how they want to do yield management as long as we plug in with them. But APS itself was less than 1.5% of all CTV ad impressions. So, meaning not necessarily Amazon, but those that came through Amazon publishing services. And so getting that more directly, it's actually better for us, better for our advertisers and deepens the relationship with the content owners. So by that measure, this was a smashing success. You bet. So, first of all, thanks for the question. It's a somewhat complicated question in large part, because third-party cookies still exist, right? And they will for the next 18 months or so. So, everything that we do in the time between now and the time when they go away inside of Chrome, the Unified ID -- the Unified ID 2.0 is a supplement to the rest of it. Now that said, I believe we'll replace it before they go away. So, I believe that it will be the primary way that people are targeting on the Open Internet before third-party cookies go away. But as people are thinking about, what's the adoption looked like. Just think about the fact that, that LiveRamp and Criteo, and Nielsen have a pretty amazing footprint. And when they talk about interoperability and adoption, it's effectively pooling the footprint that we have of LiveRamp, Criteo, Nielsen and The Trade Desk to start, that's just the start. If I were to give you the list of all the people in media that are engaged with us and with all of us that are working on it, are all the people on the supply side that are working on this, it's actually overwhelming to just keep up with the amount of success. I have never seen anything like this in the history of the internet in terms of adoption. And I think it's just because we got the product right as an industry where we said, okay, we want an upgrade to cookies where it's encrypted. It has a terms of service so that it actually operates better. We get rid of the cookie mapping issues. It's a simple framework for publishers that can better explain the quid pro quo the internet. We're giving consumers better controls. There's this SSO that comes with it, so that people can consent one time per app and website validate their email address one time and then have effectively a pass to go all over the internet, so, with open path. So, I highlight those four components to this to just say, it's an upgrade across the board on all of those things. And especially when you take the momentum that's already there, there's not a good reason for any company not to sign up as that it benefits from this common currency, which has every advertiser, every publisher, even the consumer benefits from that. So, I think we figured out the way to make it a win-win across the board. And that's why the momentum is overwhelming. Yeah. So, it's -- this is a complicated question. So in the third-party cookie universe, there is all this sinking that has to happen. So, if one company -- let's just say, Google has a cookie that says, and they identify a user as user ABC, and then Facebook has a cookie and they identify that user as one, two, three, in order for them to have a common understanding of the user, they have to pin each other. And so, when you see on the bottom of your browser, all the pixels loading constantly, it's all these companies thinking with each other so that they have a common understanding of the user and create a currency around the internet. What Unified ID 2.0 does, is it replaces that where there's constantly pings happening and sinking, so that there's a common understanding of the user and replaces it with a standard that we all have. And this effectively creates a currency for the internet. It doesn't mean that we aggregate all the data. In fact, it's liberally designed to avoid that. There is this ID where there's no data per se, attached to it. And then the individual companies themselves that have in proper ways gained insight or data, then can use that in their own four walls without having to send the data to all different places. Because everybody has an interest in creating this understanding so we can stop sinking and have a better system. We basically took a recipe from the IAB -- for the IAB has said, this is what the best solution should look like. And we just went one click down on fleshing that out. And then we sent it out to partners like Criteo and like -- which incidentally is a competitor in a lot of levels, but we felt like it was very important to start there so that we were signifying to the industry that this was a collaboration, even though we compete then we did the exact same thing with LiveRamp to just make certain that it was interoperable.  So, you asked whether it was about interoperability or about collaboration, it is about both. But we took something to them that was mostly baked and said, what do we need to modify to get you to adopt it and make it interoperable with your solutions? And that's where we are with all of them. You mentioned measurement. You're absolutely right. One of the things that I think Facebook and Google have done really well and becoming as big as they are in advertising is that they have done a good job of taking credit for what happens in all of advertising, because they touch so many conversions. When they sell something, they're effectively providing analytics to say, yes, we touched it. You sold that product because of us. The Open Internet needs to do a better job of showing the role that it plays, especially given that I believe most hearts and minds are one in things like CTV and audio. So, we need to integrate with the best measurement solutions in the world. You're going to hear a lot more from us about measurement over the next year and about partnerships that we're initiating to make that better. But there's no place better to start than with Nielsen, who's effectively been the gold standard of TV measurement for decades. Great. So, first as it relates to the political environment, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume you just mean that amount of scrutiny that -- as I call it big tack is under right now, as that continues. So, I don't think that it will affect us all of that much. But it -- whatever effect that has is likely to be positive. And here's why -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think adding pressure to Google and especially having lived through sort of the other side of antitrust with -- when I was at Microsoft, more than 10 years ago, the level of scrutiny that I think big tech is under is likely to make the Googles of the world slowdown, be a little more careful dot the I's and cross T's to make certain that they're not violating antitrust. It could likely mean that they make changes to pricing tactics and it could mean that they are less aggressive in going after targeting, even if it is in the name of privacy. So that only they would be the ones to target on the other side of that, if the collective Open Internet didn't work together. So, because of that pressure, I anticipate that we'll see some small benefit. But here's I think the most important thing that I can say on this topic. We were fine with the landscape the way it was. We built a business from the very beginning, that was built on objectivity and we wanted to focus on the demand side so that people knew what we were. And we were to some extent 10 years ago or rebuttal to Google's business model to be involved in every part of the ad tech stack. And instead, we just said, we were going to focus on the buy side, because with that came a level of transparency and objectivity that we knew someone in Google's position could never provide. So, if they have to slowdown, great. If they don't, that's fine. We're going to keep talking about the exact same principles that got us here, and we believe we're more likely to win now than we were 11 years ago and happy to keep going. Yeah. So, the milestones are mostly measured in interoperability. So, as a publisher or an advertiser says, we want to leverage this to create interoperability between our ID and somebody else's ID. And there are lots of ID initiatives out there. Nearly every agency has one that they're pursuing. Many of them have been pursuing them for multiple years. Those are all different. Most of those are similar to LiveRamp where they're about data onboarding and making it possible for people to use the data that otherwise has not been. That's different than creating a currency, which is all about interoperability. So, every time you see a press release or you see somebody publicly saying we are making our ID interoperable, you're just sort of joining the circles of what otherwise would have been a Venn diagram in the cookie world to just make a bigger circle. And so the thing to be looking for is interoperability. Did I answer the second part of his question? Great. So, you're absolutely right that we've had high hopes in China for a very long time. We've also been making investments for a few years now. Rather than just quantify when it's going to move the needle, especially as that becomes a bigger target as we continue to grow our business around the world, I'll just reiterate China is leading the world right now for us in terms of growth rate. The green shoots are really remarkable in 2020. I don't know that I would've pointed to the green shoots in years before this year. But they're really remarkable. We continue to just build out the team and build out the products that we need. Our vision is to do for the Chinese speaking world, what we've done for the English speaking world. If you look at like the places where we've had the most amount of growth the countries that we've talked most about in connected TV, it's been in the English speaking world, whether that's in Australia or in London, or in -- of course, the United States. It doesn't mean that we haven't had great success in places like Germany and other places as well, but it's been predominantly English. We think there's something very similar to be done in the Chinese speaking world, which goes beyond just greater China. And we're seeing those green shoots in 2020. So, it's one of the places that I'm interested in making investments in and spending more time in and really eager for the world to get back to some sort of normal. So, I can go back and spend more time in a place I fell in love with it. Yeah. So, I could not agree more with the premise of the question, which is that SMBs and mid-market advertisers have been driver of digital, especially for companies like Google and Facebook. We, of course, have done much better among the premium brands and deliberately started there and that continues to be the core of the market that we service. But we fully acknowledge. When we talk about a trillion dollar TAM and we talk about being focused on the demand side so that we can appeal to everybody, that objectivity and that TAM has to include advertisers of smaller sizes. The way that we service those today is largely through agencies and other tech providers that are very focused on servicing those advertisers today. There might be a time down the road that we do some of that ourselves without trying to disintermediate any of them would be the hope. But there's a lot to consider there. You asked what are the considerations? You have to have a relationship that is almost like a B2C relationship in order to service those which, I think it's just really important for us to think about as we continue to expand. So, those things are not lost on us. We're spending a lot of time trying to learn more about that market, but we continue to be focused on that trillion dollar TAM and no, we can't ignore it."

            "content": "Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to operate in an uncertain and challenging environment. However, as Jeff mentioned, we are seeing advertisers accelerate their shift to data-driven advertising in 2020. I'm really encouraged not only by this shift, but also by our company's execution during this period of uncertainty by working closely with our customers and our results demonstrate our solid operational performance. For Q3, revenue was $216 million, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. This represented a 45 percentage point acceleration from Q2. We benefited from several trends that helped us significantly exceed our expectations. One, existing advertisers shifted more spend to our platform during the quarter. This included CTV, which offers the ability for advertisers to apply data to their TV ad campaigns in ways that are simply not possible with linear. Two, we want a significant amount of new business from our competition, enabling us to gain share. And three, political spends steadily ramped up throughout the quarter and was particularly strong in the month of September. With the strong top line performance in Q3, we've generated $77 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 36% of revenue. As you have seen historically, when we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance dropped down to EBITDA, which it did in Q3. EBITDA also benefited temporarily lower than expected operating expense growth. From the channel perspective, in Q3, we continue to see improvements across all of our channels. For the quarter, spend in our mobile video, which includes connected TV, display, and audio channels all grew on a year-over-year basis. Connected TV spend was the strongest, run over 100% in Q3 on a year-over-year basis. Geographically in Q3, similar to last quarter, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. All of our major regions North America, APAC and Europe grew spend well into the double-digits year-over-year in Q3. In terms of our verticals that represented at least 1% of our spend, nearly every category improved during the quarter, with many exhibiting strong resilience in the face of the economic uncertainty that Jeff discussed. In particular, health and fitness, our largest vertical in 2019, as well as technology and computing, food and drink, and home and garden, all performed well.  Automotive showed consistent improvement as well during the quarter, ending with double-digit growth in Q3. Travel still remain negative on a year-over-year basis, but even that category showed relative improvement during the quarter and is improved on a year-over-year basis versus Q2 performance. Shopping also showed a noticeable turnaround in Q3, ending with growth well into the double-digits. And finally, as you can imagine, we have seen strong political spend in the month of September and also into October. However, it is fair to assume that we will still end 2020 as we had previously indicated, with political spend representing a mid single digit share as a percent of our spend. Operating expenses were $173 million in Q3, up 22% year-over-year. Although, faster than we invested in Q2, our operating expense growth was a bit lower than expected due to a number of factors. First, our employee support costs, including travel and corporate events, ran lower and or down materially from the prior year due to the virtual environment. Second, our bad debt expense for the quarter was lower than we had originally assumed, partially due to strong receivables health. The aging of our receivables actually improved slightly year-over-year despite the volatile economic environment, which we're obviously pleased with. Third, while we continue to produce positive net hiring every month and grew headcount in double-digits year-over-year in Q3, we did not ramp our hiring as quickly as we had hoped, also partially due to the virtual environment. Income tax expense was $1.3 million in the quarter, mainly due to the increase in profitability in the quarter, which was partially offset by employee stock-based awards. The timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $62.7 million or $1.27 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $88.5 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $66.5 million. The primary driver was the increase in net income and the change in working capital that can vary from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of payments and receivables. DSOs exit in the quarter were 101 days, up five days from a year ago. DPOs were 82 days, also up five days from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $557 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. In Q3, we paid down $70 million debt or about half of our revolving line of credit that we drew down against in the very early days of COVID-19 out of an abundance of caution. Since the end of Q3, we have paid down the remaining $72 million of our outstanding line. And as of today, we have no revolver debt on the balance sheet. I'm going to use the remainder of the time today to discuss Q4. Please be aware, our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has significantly impacted advertiser demand. Q4 has historically been our strongest quarter, driven by holiday ad spend. However, we continue to face a period of higher uncertainty in our business outlook. Assuming that the economy continues to improve, and we do not have any major COVID related setbacks that impact historically strong holiday ad spend, we estimate Q4 revenue to be between $287 million and $291 million, which would represent growth of between 33% to 35% on a year-over-year basis, a modest acceleration from our Q3 results. Under this assumption, we estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at least $115 million in Q4. I would remind you that the relative strengthened our EBITDA forecast is in part due to the virtual environment our teams are working in. While there is continued uncertainty about the economic environment, we are pleased with our momentum, and we remain highly optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for our business. We believe we have the structure in place to accelerate growth and scale our business efficiently, as economic conditions improve and are cautiously optimistic about continued measured improvement through Q4 and into 2021. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And I'll try to address this. And then Jeff, if you want to add anything, feel free at the end. With respect to the second question on thoughts around investment and margins, maybe some contexts that I can provide them may help. Just in general, we're very excited about the investment opportunities we have in front of us, whether that's in connected TV, international identity solutions or product development, such as Solomar that Jeff referenced, our focus is to drive investment in areas that drive platform spend growth. As we as we move into 2021, there's still lots of uncertainty around COVID and the macro economy. You saw the bit in Q3 areas like support costs, travel, events, and hiring, they're generally below pre-COVID levels. We're competent that when we do return to normal, whenever that is sometime in 2021, late 2021, 2022, your guess is as good as mine on that. Our margin structure should be as good as it was pre-COVID. And over the long run, as we continue to add scale potentially slightly better. But where I'd end that statement with is that please remember that we do not manage to an EBITDA target. We have areas that we are really excited about investing in and driving growth and we're always looking for those opportunities. So, if we can invest more that will drive future growth with the right long-term ROI, I will really advocate for it. And so just -- we always have to have that balanced perspective. Sure. Thanks. And I'll try to provide a little more perspective. I think, obviously, in Q3, we've seen the impact. What I refer to as the virtual environment, lower support costs in travel, corporate events, things like that. I mean, it's not just lower than quarter-over-quarter, but it's down significantly year-on-year. I think that -- and then you can obviously look at our EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter and infer in there some sense of continuation of that in those numbers themselves. I think the thing, as far as like thinking about it into the future it goes, one of the reasons why we're able to run with a lower cost base today is that we're in this virtual environment -- our customers are in this virtual environment along with us. We are here to serve our customers and meet with them and help them in any way we can. And so if and when behavior changes on a macro basis, we'll adapt accordingly. But I don't expect that personally. Now the question is the timing of when is everybody's got their own guests and none of us are going to be right about that, the timing of it. But I think it's one of those things. I think where we begin to see benefits on margins and I talked about this a little bit earlier in my answer, I think before is just with scale. As we just got larger and larger, we can gain scale. We should be able to gain efficiencies. But as far as like near term components, that's about the way that I'm thinking. I hope that helps."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to today's The Trade Desk Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Toth.\nChris Toth: Thank you, Operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today are our Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that, except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations are subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize, or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provides a more meaningful representation of the Company\u2019s operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Hello everyone and thank you for joining us. It\u2019s no secret that the last several months have been among the most trying times for all of us. The global pandemic has changed the way every business in the world operates. For us, The Trade Desk team continues to be resilient, supporting our families, friends, customers and partners. The fact that we have always been so mission driven, with a clear conviction that our greatest asset is our people, has served as a solid foundation that has allowed us to continue to expand our business during these times. While our revenue growth rate continued to be impacted by the disruptions from the COVID pandemic in the second quarter, we\u2019re starting to get a clearer picture of the role that advertising is playing as markets reopen. We talked last time about how data driven advertising would be on the front foot as that happens. And much as the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 caused many advertisers to consider data-driven strategies for the first time, I believe this crisis will cause advertisers to leverage data more aggressively than ever, as they look to make every ad dollar work as hard as possible. And we started to see this play out through our second quarter and into the start of the third. Since ad spend troughed in mid-April, advertisers have been returning and reactivating campaigns, but most of them with new approaches and new creatives given the environment we\u2019re in. They realize that as markets reopen, they have a unique opportunity to gain market share. Many paused in mid-to-late March and even early April, but some advertisers in all categories have seen this as an opportunity to gain share. To do that, they\u2019ve had to be more flexible and agile than ever, as markets open in different ways, at different rates, even within the same country. They are under pressure from their CFOs to prove the value of every advertising dollar, forcing them to prioritize advertising that is measurable and comparable. And they are dealing with a consumer base that is rapidly shifting away from traditional, linear TV. All of this puts data-driven advertising in the front seat. And we saw this reflected in our performance throughout the second quarter. While we ended Q2 with a negative 12.9% year-over-year revenue decline, since April, we saw spend on our platform increase every month and nearly every consecutive week. As advertisers have been more deliberate, ad spend turned positive on a year-over year basis in mid-June. And that trend has continued through the month of July. On a personal note, I was surprised at how unified the ad industry was in pausing activity starting in mid-March. We took a healthy economy, a healthy industry, and collectively hit the pause button. I\u2019m not sure that sort of synchronized response has ever happened before. At the same time, I was equally surprised at how unified the early phases of recovery have been so far. Not just that advertisers have returned in a consistent way, with a renewed focus on programmatic. In fact, nearly all of the largest brands have increased their spend on our platform. This includes spend from industries such as CPGs, food and beverage, technology, healthcare, and automotive. Even travel, while still negative year-over-year, has improved significantly off its mid-April lows. But it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s about the unified view I\u2019ve heard from the market regarding the direction of the advertising industry. Over the last 4 months I have met with more executives at brands and agencies than ever before in such a short period of time. So today I want to share some of that feedback with you, and in particular, the convergence of three forces that are shaping the world of digital advertising. I think this feedback will shed some light on our strategy and our performance and why we are well positioned for the future. The first is how the industry is coming to terms with user-generated content. The second is an important inflection point in CTV which is not unrelated to advertisers coming to terms with user-generated content. And lastly, I want to touch on the future of identity, because creating a solution that works for consumers, advertisers and publishers is the only way we\u2019ll be able to create a better Internet. So perhaps the most important area where I have seen a unified front from advertisers in the last few months is in their approach to user-generated content or UGC. I use the term UGC deliberately, rather than social media platforms or video platforms like YouTube, because in my discussion with advertisers, it\u2019s the nature of the content rather than the platform that\u2019s the problem. To quote Unilever, \u201cthere is much more to be done, especially in the areas of divisiveness and hate speech during this polarized election period in the U.S.\u201d Or Diageo, \u201cWe strive to promote inclusion and diversity, including through our marketing programs. We will continue to discuss with media partners how they will deal with unacceptable content.\u201d Or Starbucks, \u201cwe will continue discussions with our media partners and with civil-rights organizations in the effort to stop the spread of hate speech.\u201d Pretty much every major brand has made public statements to the same effect. The statements were all made as they pulled or suspended advertising from the major platforms that are built around UGC. The issue is not necessarily the platforms themselves. In fact, I think many advertisers believe those platforms are in a very tough spot, and I agree. The content on these platforms reflect the divisiveness in public discourse today, and that divisiveness is only exaggerated as people work through the implications of COVID-19, as social justice issues take center stage, and as we gear up for a major election. Asking social media platforms to be the arbiter of truth on a range of divisive issues is a really tough ask. In some cases, such as with hate content, it might appear straightforward. But broadly speaking, it requires applying judgements, and when you\u2019re making judgements, you\u2019re always at risk of alienating someone. It\u2019s an impossible task for UGC platforms to be asked to judge what is truth or what is hate, especially the largest companies, given the amount of content that is posted to their platforms every day. There is simply no way to keep up. But for advertisers, increasingly, it\u2019s a risk they don\u2019t want to take. Brand safety is a critical issue. They don\u2019t want the divisive argument of the day, played out on social media, sponsored by their brand. And I don\u2019t think this, in and of itself, is the wake-up call that advertisers were waiting for. I think it\u2019s the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. Advertisers have long had their doubts about advertising on UGC. But to date, it\u2019s been an easy way to reach an audience at scale. But what these issues have highlighted is that advertisers have very little transparency and control when spending dollars on user generated content. They don\u2019t know exactly what content their ads will show up against, and they don\u2019t know which consumers have interacted with their brand. By contrast, advertisers increasingly understand that The Trade Desk provides the tools they need to buy only the premium inventory they want to support, and reach only the audiences they value. These conversations have accelerated considerably in the last few months, and we are winning spend from traditional video and social media platforms as a result. One second quarter example of this was a multi-national food and drink company that, through their global agency, began to think differently about how to allocate their digital ad spend and move it away from user-generated content. In this case, they chose The Trade Desk for two main reasons. One was the ability to apply measurement and offline attribution tools to understand exactly who they were reaching. The second was the tools and breadth of premium inventory on the platform for buying CTV instead of UGC. Of course, the rapid emergence of CTV as a viable option is key here. For advertisers, access to a growing base of brand-safe, premium content could not contrast more with what is available today in user generated content. Which brings me to my second point. The surge in CTV. In Q2, despite the impact from COVID, CTV spend grew about 40% year over year. In Q3, we anticipate that the CTV spend growth rate will more than double Q2. We believe the COVID pandemic has permanently accelerated the growth of connected television, changing the TV landscape forever. And no company is better positioned to grab share in CTV than The Trade Desk. As one leading CMO said to me a recently, and I quote, \u201cI want to move as much budget from social to CTV as possible, as soon as possible.\u201d And that\u2019s not an isolated comment. Advertisers are unified about this. They understand that data-driven advertising is a better place to measure performance and target key audiences. And now they can bring that approach to their massive TV ad campaigns. And it\u2019s not just their concerns about user generated content that are forcing this. There are two other major forces at work. One is the rapidly increasing inventory of premium CTV content. The other is the consumer shift toward CTV, accelerated by the COVID pandemic. Let me quickly remind you what we discussed last time on our earnings call. Our research suggested that 11% of U.S. households would cut the cable TV cord by the end of the year. That\u2019s about triple the rate of cord cutting that we\u2019ve come to expect the last few years. That cord cutting rate rises to 18% for the coveted 18-34 year-old demo. And the number one reason households would keep cable TV? Live sports. 60% of them cited live sports as the primary reason they hang on to cable. And you don\u2019t have to take my word for it. Fast-forward three months. ROKU recently issued its annual survey into TV viewing trends. According to their research, 32% of U.S. households have now cut the cord or never had it, and a further 25% are \u201cshaving\u201d their cable TV costs. 45% of those cord shavers said they expect to fully cut the cord by year end. The number one reason? Cost savings. In the current environment, many households are looking at their home entertainment costs and their cable TV bill is often the most expensive part of their TV content line-up. But related to that, the number two reason? Access to free streaming TV services. As more broadcasters make their content available through AVOD services, the cost equation for many households is something of a no brainer. And according to the same survey, even if live sports make a comeback, less than one in five cord cutters said they\u2019d rethink their decision. Because those same sports events are now available over streaming services. So whatever assumptions you had about the shift toward CTV and how many years it would take you can throw those out. COVID has changed everything. Advertisers can\u2019t ignore these shifts in consumer behavior. And they do not want to. As I said, their growing concerns about user generated content, which are only exacerbated by recent events, represent the straw breaking the camel\u2019s back. They want to shift to the premium content that CTV now enables. Their consumers are there. In addition, not only has NBC launched its new streaming service Peacock on July 15, but Pluto reported three times the viewing hours in April that it had at the beginning of the year. Tubi reported that their viewing hours were up 100% in April. Vudu reported an increase of 55% in this stay at home environment. Such is the growth in AVOD, that these platforms have recently been acquired by Viacom, Fox and NBCU respectively. In addition to moving to where viewers are, advertisers also benefit from applying data to their TV campaigns for the first time. For example, after the COVID lockdown started, a large U.S. insurance company wanted to be more data-driven in their TV spend. Their goal was to extend reach while managing frequency. Using a third-party measurement firm through our platform, the results were transformative. Even though CTV CPMs are roughly 3 times those of linear CPMs, using CTV lowered the cost-per-unique household by over 2.5X. Even more eye opening for the brand, using CTV on our platform, they were able to reduce ad frequency to the consumer by over 80% compared with their previous linear campaigns. In this case, site visits were 2X more efficient when using data-driven CTV versus publisher data. Overall, this resulted in a significant reduction in cost per acquisition. As I see advertisers question the value of user generated content, and as they make CTV a more important element of their media mix, I also pick up a more unified sense from advertisers that they want to put more pressure on the industry to uphold certain standards. One of the attractions of CTV is that it\u2019s a more competitive market than UGC, with the standards that typically come with competition. No studio, no channel, no cable company, no MVPD, no one company has the leverage or resources to achieve the market dominance enjoyed by Google in search and Facebook in social. And because we continue to predict video in all its forms will account for about half the trillion-dollar advertising market, we believe that CTV may well be the catalyst that eventually forces all walled gardens to change course. It\u2019s important to remember that in the great scheme of things, the digital advertising industry is relatively young. As with any market that emerges, there comes a time when key participants demand certain market rules. Things like transparency and objectivity. And that\u2019s what I see happening now. CTV may be the most vivid example, but you can also look at how advertisers are now having to do more with less, how they are demanding better measurement transparency, and more market objectivity. You can even look at various regulatory initiatives within our industry, whether it\u2019s here in the U.S., or in Australia, or Europe. There\u2019s pressure on all fronts within the system to have the advertising market conform to the norms of other mature markets. And as I speak with advertisers, they put the debate regarding the future of identity in that exact same context. Which is the third point I want to touch on today. We can discuss the specifics of any one identity offering, and we are examining all of them, but at the core of it are two critical questions that advertisers and publishers think about: How do we explain the value exchange of the Internet and the role of relevant advertising to consumers? And how do we ensure power doesn\u2019t become too concentrated in one place? The moves that Apple announced recently with IDFA represent a step forward. When a consumer logs in to an iOS app, they will be asked to opt-in to tracking in return for personalized ads. That\u2019s a partial step toward explaining the value exchange of the Internet - the understanding that we get to enjoy premium content and experiences in return for relevant advertising. Google is going through the same process. But the issue is complicated for them by the dominant position they enjoy in digital advertising. If they remove cookies from the Open Internet in Chrome and rely on proprietary logins for the advertising business which makes up almost their entire revenue stream, even if using privacy as a shield - it may be seen as an overreach by regulators. In dollars and sense, I don\u2019t think the risk is worth it to them. I expect that they will find a way to preserve relevant advertising for all of the reputable advertisers and advertising platforms in Chrome. Regardless, we have to prepare for a world without third party cookies. Fortunately, we\u2019ve successfully launched and built a ubiquitous ID before - our Unified Open ID. When we developed the first iteration of our Unified ID solution, the core idea was to make sure certain players, particularly Google, didn\u2019t have an unfair cookie coverage advantage over the rest of the internet, and particularly the open internet. This was a huge success as every major SSP and exchange has adopted this ID, which is more important than ever. As more advertisers embrace data-driven advertising, especially with the CTV surge, they want to ensure that the market is competitive and that they can compare one media property to another. That kind of measurement and comparability is key, and it\u2019s not possible within walled gardens. Following the guidelines outlined by the IAB\u2019s Project Rearc, we\u2019ve been focused on ensuring that the next phase of Unified ID will help empower the open internet beyond just cookies. Development is underway with a focus on a few core characteristics: First and most importantly we need an Open ID, which is a major upgrade over current cookie technology, and which will include a hashed and encrypted ID with improved accountability measures. Unlike a cookie, this ID does not live in the browser. This ID can be used in a browser or on any type of device, including a phone or a connected TV and this ID will be free and open-sourced Second, Granular and understandable consumer controls, with the option to opt-out. Third, A simplified consent framework for publishers, which explains the value exchange of content in exchange for relevant advertising for consumers. And Fourth, Single sign on capabilities across the open Internet - so consumers don\u2019t have to consent over and over again. We won\u2019t go this alone of course. As with our initial Unified ID solution, we will work with the industry to drive consensus and standards, and to ensure we build a solution that will drive the required critical mass of adoption. We\u2019re in development and we expect to have beta versions of this solution in market soon. This work is important because cookies are an archaic technology that need to be upgraded. That said, I\u2019m still not convinced that Google, in the end, will get rid of third-party cookies. And even if they do, cookies will be replaced with something else that enables targeted advertising. I do not believe that Google will have the ability to turn off targeted advertising for everyone but them. As I said, advertisers and publishers are starting to demand the kinds of market rules for digital advertising that we\u2019ve come to expect with other mature markets, such as financial markets. Independence, objectivity, and auditable measurement are more important to advertisers than ever before. We\u2019re driven to maintain and build a free and open internet that honors the quid pro quo of the internet. We want an internet that is better for consumers as well as advertisers and publishers. As advertisers commit more of their budgets to digital, especially as they shift more of their TV dollars to CTV, they want to know that they can reach the right audiences, that they can measure and compare performance, and that they can support the right content for them. The move toward a more contemporary approach to identity will be key in building that trust for advertisers. Let me close by just reiterating the consistency of these themes among advertisers. If, like me, during COVID, you\u2019ve been sucked into the world of online webinars and events, you\u2019ll have heard many of the same themes. But I\u2019m excited by it. Advertisers are more tuned in to the power of data-driven advertising than ever before. They understand the role it can play in helping them be agile in the midst of today\u2019s uncertainty. They understand it can help them gain market share. And as they embrace it across their advertising channels, they are demanding more of our industry. This has been an important moment for The Trade Desk. 2020 is a moment where the culture we have built over the last decade is paying dividends, perhaps more than ever. Also, we have always been a company with a vision and a mission, and that has been more valuable in 2020 than any moment in our past. And that\u2019s always been our approach. We\u2019ve spent 10 years getting ready for this moment. While we still have a great deal of uncertainty in front of us, we\u2019re very excited about the future. Now, let me turn the call over to Blake to discuss our financial performance.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I hope you\u2019re all doing as well as possible in this challenging environment. Before turning to results, I wanted to comment briefly on the status of our company\u2019s operations. Today, we are currently operating with the majority of our full-time employees working from home. Safety is the number one priority for our team. We fully support our employees as they either continue to work from home or return to the office based on their preference and where allowed by local regulations, and in Q2 we were pleased to continue to onboard positive net new employees every month, investing in talent that we believe will deliver future value to our clients. Given the circumstances, I really can\u2019t say enough about the dedication, focus and professionalism with which The Trade Desk team is tackling the challenges presented during this period. Now moving on to our results, In Q2, revenue was $139.4 million representing a decline of 12.9% year-over-year. That said, however, the story that developed over the quarter was a positive one. Coming off the lows we experienced in mid-April, spending trends improved throughout the period and by mid-June turned positive on a year-over-year basis and that has continued into July. As we began to see those improvements, we started to increase the pace of our investments to further capitalize on the opportunity that is presenting itself in our business, particularly in CTV. For Q2, despite the year-over-year revenue decline, we generated $14.6 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 10.5% of revenue. With the investments we are making in our people and our solid working capital situation, we believe we are well positioned for future growth acceleration as conditions continue to improve. From the channel perspective, Q2 included strong year-over-year spend growth, relatively speaking, in branded channels where advertisers can really connect with customers. Here Connected TV was up roughly 40% and audio was up 23% year-over-year in Q2. During the month of July we continue to see improvements across all of our channels. Geographically in Q2, similar to last quarter, North America represented 88% of spend and International represented 12% of spend. Some of the spending trends that I mentioned earlier applied to our regions, as North America, APAC and Europe each improved every month during the quarter on a year-over-year basis. In terms of our verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly every category improved between April and June, with many exhibiting strong resilience. In particular, Health & Fitness, our largest vertical in 2019, as well as Technology & Computing, Home and Garden, and Education continued to perform well. While still improving materially from their April lows, Travel and Automotive lagged behind - although in the last few weeks we have seen Automotive turn positive year-over-year and are encouraged about that. We are actively working with large automotive companies and their agencies to activate more campaigns on the platform. Our early May CTV launch provided an opportunity to showcase our ability to deliver incremental reach, with frequency controls and measurement of real business outcomes. As a result, CTV represented a significant amount of these brands ad spend on our platform in Q2. We believe this represents a growing opportunity in the back half of 2020 and into next year. Operating expenses were $155 million in Q2, up 21% year-over-year. This increase reflects continued investment across areas such as our technical talent and business development teams, but also being mindful of our cost structure in this environment and decelerated from 30% year-over-year growth in Q1. This approach to our operating expenses continues to reflect how we actively allocate capital within the company toward areas that can drive future growth. As spend started to recover we began allocating resources to incremental investments. Our goal is to invest heavily in the areas that can drive growth so we can grab share during the recovery. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.6 million in Q2, representing a 10.5% margin. Income tax was a benefit of $41 million in the quarter mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted Net income for the quarter was $44.8 million or $0.92 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $96.3 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $75.5 million. The primary driver for the increase was a change in working capital that can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of payments and receivables. DSOs exiting the quarter were 96 days, down six days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days, down seven days from a year ago. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $555 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. I\u2019d like to remind you that depending on the shape of the recovery curve, our liquidity position will fluctuate as we fund our growth. I am going to use the remainder of the time today to discuss Q3 and how we are managing the company through the current environment. Like last quarter, we do not intend to provide financial guidance for the full year. However, we do want to provide direction for Q3. Please be aware, our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has significantly impacted advertiser demand. Like many companies that are ad-funded, we are facing a period of higher uncertainty in our business outlook. We expect our business performance could be impacted by issues beyond our control, such as shelter-in-place orders that may or may not occur. Assuming that the economy continues to open up and we do not have any major COVID related setbacks that may cause economic conditions to deteriorate, we estimate revenue growth in Q3 to increase 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. Under this assumption, we estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at least $30 million in Q3. We also continue to be mindful of cash management, maintaining liquidity and investing in working capital as spend continues to increase. From an expense management perspective, while we are increasing our investments today, in light of the current environment, I want to remind you that we do have flexibility should things deteriorate. I\u2019m proud of the agility we exhibited in Q2, and we have those levers, and additional ones depending on the environment, as needed. However, we are certainly encouraged and remain motivated by the stabilization trend in spend we have seen since the middle of April. We believe we have the structure in place to accelerate growth and gain share as economic conditions improve and are cautiously optimistic about continued measured improvement through the remainder of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move first to Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead.\nBrian Schwartz: Yes, so thank you for taking my question this afternoon. I have a question, Jeff on the long-term impact from COVID-19 on the connected TV market. There is some investor concern here that COVID might be pulling in accelerating spend for connected TV given your guidance here for connected TV to more than double in 3Q, it's a big step-up from 2Q? But I want to ask you if you really agree with that or do you think what has happened so far as a structural change in the market? So essentially Jeff, what is the shape of this post pandemic demand picture on the connected TV market look like for the Trade Desk? Thank you and congratulations.\nJeff Green: Well, thanks, Brian appreciate the question and the kind words. So yes, so let me start with the punch line. So I think connected TV and television in general has changed forever because of COVID-19. And nothing is going to undo the change that has been instigated. Is there some amount of viewership that is currently on AVOD that will go back to sports or something like that? There is some amount of that, but I'm really drawn to a couple of the big vector number. So first of all, we highlighted in the prepared remarks that cord cutting is typically been around 3% a year is according to our research expected to be around 11%. That's largely because the number one reason that people hang on to cable is sports at 60% of people saying that's their number one reason for hanging onto it. Even a sports comeback, the sports aren't nearly as watch as desirable as they were. But intimately, it's really important to note that as they are coming back, we're getting access to all of them. So even in their limited forms where a lot of people seeing them on demand and we're showing ads for the NDA. The major league baseball, major league soccer, tennis, even UFC - so we're showing ads across all the sports that are coming back. Of course, we've also seen a large surge in unemployment. And that of course, makes everybody and those that have been affected negatively economically, which is almost everyone to look at their TV line up and say what's the most expensive part and where do I need to cut and that almost always leads the cable television. It's really important, and I didn't emphasize this enough in the prepared remarks that cable television and connected TV are both. I think at a really important point, which is that the number of households that we can reach just passed in this quarter, 80 million households. And according to the projections that we have for this year, cable households are subscribers will drop below 80 million for the first time in many years. So there is a bit of a changing of the guard that's happening right now and I don't expect that to ever change again. So I guess the punch line to your question is that CTV has changed the landscape forever. The effects of C-19 have changed them forever. There might be some noise as things get back to normal. But as they get back to normal, people are moving, where they want to go, which is on-demand.\nOperator: We'll move next to Shyam Patil with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the impressive execution. I had a couple of questions. First one Jeff, can you talk a little bit more about the upcoming IDFA changes, what they mean for the Trade Desk? And also, how do you think Android will react to this?\nJeff Green: So first, whenever we started to talk about IDs, it's really easy for me to lose people in the technical details. And so I always like to start with the headline and then just reinforce the headline as we finish, which is I'm extremely confident that The Trade Desk is going to be fine no matter what. I'm extremely confident that quid pro quo of the Internet cannot be disrupted by a single company, whether they are dependent directly on advertising or indirectly on advertising. With that as prefix Apple is indirectly dependent on advertising for what I believe to be the most valuable asset that Apple has which is their app marketplace. So people often make the point that Apple is not in the advertising business. And that's true they're not directly in the advertising business. But they are indirectly in the advertising business which is most of their apps and their ecosystem, again, which I believe to be their most valuable asset are dependent on ads in some form. All of that said, it's only about 10% of our spend uses IDFA in anyway. And one thing that I think is really important to remind everybody else is that we look at millions and millions of ad opportunities every single second, ballpark call 11 million. And with that 11 million, if you were to take away 1 million and say, now you have to fulfill all of your budgets, with only 10 million ads available every single second. We would be just fine. We would just buy a different 10 million. So if IDFA were to go completely away or everybody were to opt out, we would just buy different apps - so it wouldn't have much impact. That said, because Apple is dependent on that, I don't expect that and there might be some short-term surge in opt-outs. But because Apple has made clear that they will do a better job of explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet, which by the way is amazing progress, that's good news for everybody. I do think long-term when people go to apps and find that they don't work as well because in fact you do need to share your location with the Yelp in order for it to work at all. The long-term, everybody is going to become more familiar with the quid pro quo of the Internet and will have access to nearly the same amount of inventory that we have today. So, I don't expect there to be any major disruption in the short-term or the long term. I'm even more confident that there won't be any meaningful disruption in the long-term, which comes to the second part of your question which is Google. If I'm Google especially when I've already made the announcement about the future of cookies inside of Chrome and they've been - Sundar was asked about it directly multiple times in the recent hearings. I'm not going to start this - I'm not going to start a fight on another front. And especially, because here at Google and I'm speaking as if I'm them. We are dependent on ads. So unlike Apple, which is indirectly dependent on ads, we are 95 plus percent of our revenue, I think comes from ads. But so, we're going to wait and learn from what happens with Apple and then make changes. But if Apple overreach, we will benefit because app providers will then start building to our platform first, instead of the Apple's. And then we will gain more market share. So if I'm working at Google, I'm secretly hoping that Apple messes it up, so that we can win share. But given the number of places that - sort of Google is under attack, I would be waiting and watching before acting. So I think both of the strategic positions that they're in their means, that's the quid pro quo of the Internet is just fine, and that brings me back to our headline, which is The Trade Desk is just fine.\nShyam Patil: And if I could sneak in one more for you Blake, thank you for the color on the 3Q EBITDA and investment levels. I was just wondering, I know you don't want to guide beyond 3Q, but just in terms of kind of how you're thinking about OpEx or investment for the fourth quarter? Is there any kind of framework, you could provide us? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure, thanks for the question, Shyam, I appreciate it. Yes, just to back up quickly, I was really pleased with how we manage the second quarter from an expense standpoint. Despite the COVID headwinds, we still generated nearly $15 million in positive EBITDA for the quarter. Our expense growth deceled, we\u2019re up around 30% in Q1 and we deceled up 21% in Q2. So that said, even with the decel from Q1, we're still investing materially in the business and we continue to do so. Like we discussed in the prepared remarks, we did release more investment as we saw trends improve during the quarter. Additional color, I can try to help you with is on the Q1 call you might recall we were targeting our full-year 2020 hiring at more than 50% under our original plan. Today that figure has been reduced, it's probably closer to 30% to 40% as of today. So because of that, the expense growth in the second half, it's likely - if I had to say it's likely closer to what we saw in Q1 from a year-over-year growth perspective than what we saw in Q2. But you know I also would want to add. Remember, we really don't manage to an EBITDA target. We invest where the opportunity is. We invest where we believe the long-term value is, we'll always try and flex around that. And then also we have levers available to us if there was a macro deterioration of any kind. So, we showed that agility in Q2 and I'm really proud of that and so we have not only those levers that we were able to use in Q2, but we also have others available if needed. So we like our positioning where we can invest in growth, but also show the flexibility as needed based on overall macro trends to make the right choices for the company in the long term.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Michael Levine with Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.\nMichael Levine: So, a question for you, Jeff. I wanted to talk a little bit more about connected TV. I mean obviously great numbers for the quarter and where you're looking at on the outlook, but I'd like to really unlock this opportunity to a much greater degree, what are the structural changes you feel like need to happen within the industry? If you think through, let's say, the advertising agencies, the media companies\u2019 behavior that you're seeing at clients and so I'd love to hear your tuitions there?\nJeff Green: Yes, so first of all, thanks for the question. So, one of them, I think it's happening right now and it's sort of indirectly related to connected TV and that is for the first time, a massive amount of really premium content has come into data driven Internet, fuel media and that's AVOD and all the content that's come in to connected TV over the last few years. And so that just changes a number of choices that advertisers have. And so what's really important that they do, and this has really been instigated an accelerated this year is evaluate what is the value of premium content on a relative basis to everything else, especially user generated content. And so I'm really impressed by number one, how much content has come online and how much viewership has come online. I noted the Wall Street Journal made the comment that Disney+ has picked up as many subscribers in the last roughly year as Netflix did in its first eight years. Peacock just launched in July and is off to a good start. We quoted numbers from Pluto and Tubi and others, when we're talking 3x growth in April at 100% growth in April. So all of that coming online at the same time that people are having a discussion about the relative value of premium to UGC is a really important thing to keep unlocking dollars. Also just in general measurement is probably the long pole in connected TV. So this relative value is an important discussion and it also just impacts the measurement discussion, which is the way that GRPs and reach our measured in linear television, it doesn't really penalize advertisers or media companies to show you the same ad over and over and over again, and sometimes that even creates negative brand affinity where if you show me the same ad 100 times, I start liking your brand less. But the way traditional television measurement works, it doesn't penalize that behavior. Rectifying just price and measuring reach and frequency and the fact that you have way more control in connected TV than what you can get with cheap GRPs and traditional television rectifying the way we measure between old TV and new TV is a really important thing that just has to continue to get better, and you'll see us continue to invest in product. We've made some big hires to help us with this, in fact, in this quarter. So it's something very top of mind because that is definitely one of the things that will unlock more spend. But as you can see by the prediction, that we'll do more than double our growth rate of Q2 at 40%. We are extremely confident that in the short term, we'll continue to improve.\nOperator: We'll move next to Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Please go ahead.\nVasily Karasyov: Jeff, you were talking about webinars you were doing all quarter and I listened to a couple of those and you spoke about your unified ID. And I know you touched on it in the prepared remarks, but I think it's such an important topic, given how much identity resolution and privacy is, how central it is to everyone's thoughts about this space. I was wondering if you can talk a little more about it in a little more detail and maybe explain to us in a simpler terms, what do you think potential implications could be and why you are paying so much attention? Why you are leading the charge on that in the industry now? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Yes, thanks. So I've been talking publicly for a few years now about how dissatisfied I am with the way companies like Apple and sometimes even Google have talked about privacy. And especially in the way that they've explained the quid pro quo of the Internet. So we don't always know why we're typing in our Apple ID for the 9,000th time in a month, but it often is because you're getting consent for something that they're not explaining well. And so we look at the current state of discussion on cookies and especially - really this started with GDPR where regulators rightfully said Internet players need to better explain the quid pro quo of the Internet and you need to just give notice in the case while you're providing targeted advertising to pay for your content. And the response to GDPR in part because people didn't quite know what to do with often do just say things like there are cookies, there are cookies on my site. Instead of explaining what those cookies do and explain how the quid pro quo of the Internet works. So what we want to do and what we've announced and we've developed, it is a framework for making that quid pro quo of the Internet better. So we spend a lot of time thinking about how cookies can be improved upon, how we could create an alternative to cookies and make that available to everyone else. So unlike many of the big players in tech who come up with a solution like this and then say, great, now, I can have proprietary advantage over everyone else. All we want is an ecosystem that is better and we're fine if it benefits everyone including Google and Facebook and others. And as our product, we expect to be successful and part of the reason we expect it to be successful is because it is better for all the major players and therefore it's easier for us to invite them to participate. And so, as we mentioned one part of this is that there will be an ID. Historically, all of this in a third-party cookie is an ID, a random number and this ID what actually be encrypted, it would also come with terms of service that are regulated by the ID which is better than cookies on both fronts. It also comes with better opt out so that publishers can actually better explain the quid pro quo of the Internet and we're going to be more prescriptive with publishers as to what we expect them to say so that they better explain that and we're going to spend more money with the publishers that do a better job of explaining that quid pro quo. We're also going to give a framework to companies like Apple, so when they update iOS like they are about to and they give consumers control, we'll give them a place to send us that information so that we can honor. And then we'll also create the most lightweight simple FSO available so that especially long tail publishers will continue to be competitive. If in fact Google were to get rid of third-party cookies and say, well we have logins so we'll use those to our benefit, the long tail publishers, in particular, would be the ones to get hurt. And so by offering them something that is very lightweight as well as not trying to take anything from them, we think it makes it possible to create a much better Internet for everybody. So just like unified ID and I want to be very clear on this, we do not need to go get billions of consumers to sign up for something in order for us to succeed on this. All we need to do is get a few of the most forward thinking publishers and SSPs and exchanges to understand and adopt and then it will be successful because we've already shared this with one of the biggest advertisers in the world who responded by saying, what can we do to help, we'll do everything including getting on stage and talking about how important this is, which that they will come. Secondly, we've already presented this to several of the most sophisticated SSP and exchanges. And they've said - one of their CEO said, this is going to work, it couldn't be pulled off by anybody. But you guys because of the position you play in the ecosystem and it's going to work, what do we have to do to help, tell us what we can do to be a good partner. And that's the general sentiment across the space. So all it requires in order to be successful is adoption from the most sophisticated players in our space and we're extremely confident that just like with unified ID 1.0 we can do that again. So it's a very bold initiative, which will really benefit the entire Internet and we're optimistic that we can do it again.\nOperator: And we will take our next question momentarily.\nChris Toth: One second, please. Did you drop off, [Kali]?\nOperator: My apologies.\nChris Toth: Okay, great.\nUnidentified Analyst: We're back on air. Okay. So one on CTV, one on China. CTV, so we had 40% growth in a quarter just reported were total ad revenue was down, total revenue was down 13% and now we're going to double that 40% growth to 80% next quarter, I assume will be more robust in the fourth quarter. Jeff, can you size for us how big do you think as a percent of total revenue CTV is by the end of 2020 for the Trade Desk? And how much is benefiting from the upfront $7 billion less being spend in upfront. So that's in scatter where you can compete for it. And how much is aiding you from live sports coming back? It sounds like you're getting access to that inventory I think for the first time. So that's the CTV question. And then China, geopolitical risk tensions, we're throwing out TikTok and we've got revenue under pressure in your core business. How do you think about the investment levels and the geopolitical risks of investing in China going forward from here? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Thanks for the question. So in CTV, it is definitely the case that we have benefited from upfronts being weak and as we talk about a perfect storm in traditional television, that could never be more apparent than what happened to this year's upfronts especially because the sharp downturn that the economy especially advertising experienced between the middle of March and middle of April is also the exact time of when the upfronts is, which is, again end of March and April. So we definitely benefited from that being taken out and we definitely benefited from live sports being taken out of traditional television. As sports comes back, I think more and more people are going to be watching it, streaming and we'll benefit from that. As it relates to the mix in total percentage of revenue, we just don't comment on that yet. And the reason why we don't, is just as it's growing at such an amazing rate, we don't want to have to constantly be explaining any change in the shape of the curve that are just blips. But the general direction is all up into the right. We expect that to continue. And of course, when we're growing it, as you point out, 40% this quarter and over 80% next quarter where of course connected TV is leading the way. So if there is any other color, I can give on that, that's more a qualitative, it's simply that our sales team is leading every conversation with connected TV and connected TV is leading the recovery inside of programmatic. On the second question, as it relates to China and just international expansion, there are definitely markets that have been more negatively impacted from COVID than others. And so I think this is going to have a disproportionate effect for good and bad on every market. So every market will be different than they were before. Important to note that of the 25 offices that we have around the world, we only have a handful of them that are open today and the very first one that open was China. They went back to work very first. The numbers that they are putting up specifically are very impressive as a growth rate, but it's also compared against relatively low numbers and as we would say easy comps. So I'm really encouraged by what's happening in China. As it relates to the geopolitical and just that whatever increased tension has come through the back and forth of leaders and attention between the two countries, I think I've noted before. I think there is an economic dependence between each other, meaning, between the U.S. and China that no one can really disrupt, it's not dissimilar from what I talk about the quid pro quo of the Internet, cannot be disrupted the way that products are manufactured and where the biggest consumers in the world are, the biggest manufacturers in the world are, that creates a independence or co-dependence that is so great that I don't think that that can be meaningfully disrupted even though speed bumps can be created. But I just keep looking at it as it's the second largest media market in the world. We definitely save that one for later in our growth cycle, but we have amazing relationships with Baidu, Alibaba Tencent. Our TikTok relationship that started in Asia, it started very strong and we continue to have great expectations for that around the world and just continue to make investments and we continue to see things move up into the right.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Youssef Squali with Truist. Please go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: I have two quick questions. One, Jeff, data revenues has been - have been very, very important piece of the Trade Desk's story and margins. Maybe can you just actually kind of highlight or break down, how much of the revenues last quarter did come from data? How should we thinking about it going forward, in particular, in light of all the changes that you spoke to earlier IDF, Chrome et cetera? And then just a quick one on political spending and maybe the likely impact you're expecting potentially in the second half? Thank you.\nJeff Green: So first as it relates to a percentage of our revenue, we've never broken that out and we don't break it out for a number of reasons not least of which is that, I look at data as something at times, I'm willing to give away in an effort to just help people buy more media, more intelligently. And if that makes our clients more sticky and more invested and especially, see more ROI, I can make up the money that I could have made in charging for that by getting another dollar, if you will. So, meaning, getting another dollar media spend. So we're always making that trade-off, but I'd like to address the sort of bigger picture question that you framed because I think that's really important. And if I even rephrase your question, which is to say, hey, there is a lot of discussion happening with IDFA, with a third-party cookies going away inside of Chrome. There is a lot of things that are saying the way that quid pro quo of the Internet works may change. And if that change, not that the quid pro quo will change, but the mechanics of that quid pro quo may change. If they change, will that be good or bad for data companies? And the short answer is, I think it's good for data companies. So right now cookies in particular, create a really difficult way for data to be onboarded. It's actually created more of a barrier than anything else. Data gets applied more easily to things like direct mail and almost every other form of advertising then it does the browsing Internet. And as the Internet grows and as devices get more fragmented, having something that's more common as well as just better consent, will actually create more opportunities for data companies that do the right thing. So data companies that have been aggressive or deceitful, they're going away. Data companies that do the right thing and operate without being too aggressive on collection or on deployment are going to do really well. And I think if you look forward 20 years, there is more of them than there are now, but there is way less deceit on the Internet, 20 years from now than there is now just like there is less now than there was 10 years ago.\nYoussef Squali: Political?\nJeff Green: The political side, sorry. So a lot of questions about how is political going to be different given the environment. There's lots of discussions about even how people are going to vote in this upcoming election. But I don't think there is that much debate though about the fact that more people are going to be home, more of the debate and discussion is going to be hosted over the Internet, largely because people are having this discussion and debate in their own homes, just because of the nature of C-19. I think also the amount of uncertainty has put a little bit more budget closer to the actual election time, there will be \u2013 that it's possible that there's fewer debates and meaning actual debates where the candidates get next to each other. And if that's the case, then I think every candidate and every party is dependent more on the discussion that happens in digital ecosystems and that includes programmatic advertising. So, I think all of that means that this one is going to be more of a digital election, if you will than any ever before.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Tim Nolan with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nTim Nolan: Jeff, as always, a lot of great color around the CTV universe, and I wanted to follow-up with another question on CTV. And that's we're hearing a lot from media companies on them establishing linear/CTV ad sales platforms. We got another announcement today from ViacomCBS. My understanding is these media companies are not really putting a whole lot of inventory into real-time bidding, but it's more private market transactions and things? And I just wonder if you could maybe address this topic and what I'm wondering is sort of how much real-time bidding actually goes on in CTV ads with the media companies? I'm assuming it's still very low, but I'm also assuming they will be putting more into exchanges and doing more real-time bid impressions, and that I would guess it's very good for the growth of CTV in general. So I wonder if you could just address this topic, please?\nJeff Green: Yes, you bet. I appreciate you're asking it. There is a lot of nuance in this topic. So let me take a step back and try to describe what's happening in CTV as it relates to the mechanics of data driven advertising. So when you're starting the new market, there is this chicken and egg problem. Until you have something to sell, nobody wants to come to your store. If somebody comes to your store, you don't have enough products to sell they don't want to come back. But if you put way too many products in your store then you have people showing up, then you're not going to want to sell the products that way anymore. So there is this chicken and egg problem. And one of the ways that that's getting solved in CTV and has been getting solved over the last few years is to just agree on what the price is going to be or agree on who's going to buy it. And so, the ideal marketplace is to let the market in real-time decide what to pay and decide what inventory to buy, you might not right-size the inventory and you might not right-size the demand. And also because of scarcity, because as CTV has been taking off, right up until this year, there wasn't enough inventory there for people to feel comfortable that they were going to spend the right amounts. So they like to be something a little bit more like a reserve or to have a little bit more of a reassurance that they're actually going to spend. So one of the ways they've done that is to create these private marketplaces where you basically create a deal and you agree on some of the vectors that would otherwise be variables in the future, that includes things like price. So real-time bidding is just another way of saying to leverage more data in real-time, so that you have more of a chance to inspect. While the most sophisticated buyers in the world have made it very clear and that includes people or brands like Procter & Gamble, they have said very loudly they want the power of choice. And they would rather pay a premium and choose what they get and what they pay than to just lock something in and then hand over decisioning to the sell side. That will be more the norm going forward as more and more inventory has come online, more brands are going to say, I'm willing to pay a premium for choice. And given that there is more supply coming on, that's actually an important thing for the supply side to do in order to get that premium. So that is very good for us, that's very good for the industry. In fact, it's really essential for connected TV that things start to move in that direction. So that prices continue to be able to fund the amazing content that all of us get to experience as consumers right now. So, really important question and the trend is heading in the right direction.\nOperator: We'll move next to Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the CMO telling you they want to move spend from social to CTV as rapidly as possible. Beyond some of the near-term \u2013 pressures that you're seeing with boycotts and social unrest and the elections. Do you get a sense that some brand advertisers are kind of beginning to lose faith in feed-based advertising, because they are increasingly \u2013 they're not just getting in front of their consumers within the feed? But now they're being put in a position where they're kind of responsible for the organic content in the feed too. Do you see that trend resonating with advertisers?\nJeff Green: Yes, so it's an interesting way to put it, which is feed-based advertising versus user generated content. I do think the bigger issue is user generated content even though, you could also make the argument about the feed-based simply because it's harder to determine context. But I think when you're very high level about this \u2013 advertisers have more choices than they've ever had. And they have more data and more insight and they're smarter than they've ever been. And so, I think we're having a very important discussion on the Internet right now about what is the value and the risk of user generated content. And I've just been surprised and I mentioned this in the prepared remarks about how coordinated it seems the Internet has been especially the advertisers, the funders of the Internet. How coordinated they've been in saying, hey, especially as we move in to a pretty heated and competitive election, more people are saying in user generated spaces, your politics suck, you're an idiot. You just don't want that to be a brand that says this conversations brought to you by brand X. And so as a result, there, just looking at that same where are safer places. And if there were anything else to contribute to the perfect storm of traditional television that's contributing to connected TV, it's that because they are then saying, while there is this alternative which is all this premium content that I can advertise on and its premium video. It's a big video on a big screen that I know we'll run, and I know what I get. I know what I'm running next to. It's a very compelling alternative as people are struggling with what UGC or as you put it feed-based ads represent so they\u2019re definitely rethinking it.\nOperator: It does appear there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Chris Toth for any closing remarks.\nChris Toth: Great, thank you all for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and look forward to speaking to you again in about three months. Have a good evening everyone.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Hello everyone and thank you for joining us. It's no secret that the last several months have been among the most trying times for all of us. The global pandemic has changed the way every business in the world operates. For us, The Trade Desk team continues to be resilient, supporting our families, friends, customers and partners. The fact that we have always been so mission driven, with a clear conviction that our greatest asset is our people, has served as a solid foundation that has allowed us to continue to expand our business during these times. While our revenue growth rate continued to be impacted by the disruptions from the COVID pandemic in the second quarter, we're starting to get a clearer picture of the role that advertising is playing as markets reopen. We talked last time about how data driven advertising would be on the front foot as that happens. And much as the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 caused many advertisers to consider data-driven strategies for the first time, I believe this crisis will cause advertisers to leverage data more aggressively than ever, as they look to make every ad dollar work as hard as possible. And we started to see this play out through our second quarter and into the start of the third. Since ad spend troughed in mid-April, advertisers have been returning and reactivating campaigns, but most of them with new approaches and new creatives given the environment we're in. They realize that as markets reopen, they have a unique opportunity to gain market share. Many paused in mid-to-late March and even early April, but some advertisers in all categories have seen this as an opportunity to gain share. To do that, they've had to be more flexible and agile than ever, as markets open in different ways, at different rates, even within the same country. They are under pressure from their CFOs to prove the value of every advertising dollar, forcing them to prioritize advertising that is measurable and comparable. And they are dealing with a consumer base that is rapidly shifting away from traditional, linear TV. All of this puts data-driven advertising in the front seat. And we saw this reflected in our performance throughout the second quarter. While we ended Q2 with a negative 12.9% year-over-year revenue decline, since April, we saw spend on our platform increase every month and nearly every consecutive week. As advertisers have been more deliberate, ad spend turned positive on a year-over year basis in mid-June. And that trend has continued through the month of July. On a personal note, I was surprised at how unified the ad industry was in pausing activity starting in mid-March. We took a healthy economy, a healthy industry, and collectively hit the pause button. I'm not sure that sort of synchronized response has ever happened before. At the same time, I was equally surprised at how unified the early phases of recovery have been so far. Not just that advertisers have returned in a consistent way, with a renewed focus on programmatic. In fact, nearly all of the largest brands have increased their spend on our platform. This includes spend from industries such as CPGs, food and beverage, technology, healthcare, and automotive. Even travel, while still negative year-over-year, has improved significantly off its mid-April lows. But it's more than that. It's about the unified view I've heard from the market regarding the direction of the advertising industry. Over the last 4 months I have met with more executives at brands and agencies than ever before in such a short period of time. So today I want to share some of that feedback with you, and in particular, the convergence of three forces that are shaping the world of digital advertising. I think this feedback will shed some light on our strategy and our performance and why we are well positioned for the future. The first is how the industry is coming to terms with user-generated content. The second is an important inflection point in CTV which is not unrelated to advertisers coming to terms with user-generated content. And lastly, I want to touch on the future of identity, because creating a solution that works for consumers, advertisers and publishers is the only way we'll be able to create a better Internet. So perhaps the most important area where I have seen a unified front from advertisers in the last few months is in their approach to user-generated content or UGC. I use the term UGC deliberately, rather than social media platforms or video platforms like YouTube, because in my discussion with advertisers, it's the nature of the content rather than the platform that's the problem. To quote Unilever, \u201cthere is much more to be done, especially in the areas of divisiveness and hate speech during this polarized election period in the U.S.\u201d Or Diageo, \u201cWe strive to promote inclusion and diversity, including through our marketing programs. We will continue to discuss with media partners how they will deal with unacceptable content.\u201d Or Starbucks, \u201cwe will continue discussions with our media partners and with civil-rights organizations in the effort to stop the spread of hate speech.\u201d Pretty much every major brand has made public statements to the same effect. The statements were all made as they pulled or suspended advertising from the major platforms that are built around UGC. The issue is not necessarily the platforms themselves. In fact, I think many advertisers believe those platforms are in a very tough spot, and I agree. The content on these platforms reflect the divisiveness in public discourse today, and that divisiveness is only exaggerated as people work through the implications of COVID-19, as social justice issues take center stage, and as we gear up for a major election. Asking social media platforms to be the arbiter of truth on a range of divisive issues is a really tough ask. In some cases, such as with hate content, it might appear straightforward. But broadly speaking, it requires applying judgements, and when you're making judgements, you're always at risk of alienating someone. It's an impossible task for UGC platforms to be asked to judge what is truth or what is hate, especially the largest companies, given the amount of content that is posted to their platforms every day. There is simply no way to keep up. But for advertisers, increasingly, it's a risk they don't want to take. Brand safety is a critical issue. They don't want the divisive argument of the day, played out on social media, sponsored by their brand. And I don't think this, in and of itself, is the wake-up call that advertisers were waiting for. I think it's the straw that breaks the camel's back. Advertisers have long had their doubts about advertising on UGC. But to date, it's been an easy way to reach an audience at scale. But what these issues have highlighted is that advertisers have very little transparency and control when spending dollars on user generated content. They don't know exactly what content their ads will show up against, and they don't know which consumers have interacted with their brand. By contrast, advertisers increasingly understand that The Trade Desk provides the tools they need to buy only the premium inventory they want to support, and reach only the audiences they value. These conversations have accelerated considerably in the last few months, and we are winning spend from traditional video and social media platforms as a result. One second quarter example of this was a multi-national food and drink company that, through their global agency, began to think differently about how to allocate their digital ad spend and move it away from user-generated content. In this case, they chose The Trade Desk for two main reasons. One was the ability to apply measurement and offline attribution tools to understand exactly who they were reaching. The second was the tools and breadth of premium inventory on the platform for buying CTV instead of UGC. Of course, the rapid emergence of CTV as a viable option is key here. For advertisers, access to a growing base of brand-safe, premium content could not contrast more with what is available today in user generated content. Which brings me to my second point. The surge in CTV. In Q2, despite the impact from COVID, CTV spend grew about 40% year over year. In Q3, we anticipate that the CTV spend growth rate will more than double Q2. We believe the COVID pandemic has permanently accelerated the growth of connected television, changing the TV landscape forever. And no company is better positioned to grab share in CTV than The Trade Desk. As one leading CMO said to me a recently, and I quote, \u201cI want to move as much budget from social to CTV as possible, as soon as possible.\u201d And that's not an isolated comment. Advertisers are unified about this. They understand that data-driven advertising is a better place to measure performance and target key audiences. And now they can bring that approach to their massive TV ad campaigns. And it's not just their concerns about user generated content that are forcing this. There are two other major forces at work. One is the rapidly increasing inventory of premium CTV content. The other is the consumer shift toward CTV, accelerated by the COVID pandemic. Let me quickly remind you what we discussed last time on our earnings call. Our research suggested that 11% of U.S. households would cut the cable TV cord by the end of the year. That's about triple the rate of cord cutting that we've come to expect the last few years. That cord cutting rate rises to 18% for the coveted 18-34 year-old demo. And the number one reason households would keep cable TV? Live sports. 60% of them cited live sports as the primary reason they hang on to cable. And you don't have to take my word for it. Fast-forward three months. ROKU recently issued its annual survey into TV viewing trends. According to their research, 32% of U.S. households have now cut the cord or never had it, and a further 25% are \u201cshaving\u201d their cable TV costs. 45% of those cord shavers said they expect to fully cut the cord by year end. The number one reason? Cost savings. In the current environment, many households are looking at their home entertainment costs and their cable TV bill is often the most expensive part of their TV content line-up. But related to that, the number two reason? Access to free streaming TV services. As more broadcasters make their content available through AVOD services, the cost equation for many households is something of a no brainer. And according to the same survey, even if live sports make a comeback, less than one in five cord cutters said they'd rethink their decision. Because those same sports events are now available over streaming services. So whatever assumptions you had about the shift toward CTV and how many years it would take you can throw those out. COVID has changed everything. Advertisers can't ignore these shifts in consumer behavior. And they do not want to. As I said, their growing concerns about user generated content, which are only exacerbated by recent events, represent the straw breaking the camel's back. They want to shift to the premium content that CTV now enables. Their consumers are there. In addition, not only has NBC launched its new streaming service Peacock on July 15, but Pluto reported three times the viewing hours in April that it had at the beginning of the year. Tubi reported that their viewing hours were up 100% in April. Vudu reported an increase of 55% in this stay at home environment. Such is the growth in AVOD, that these platforms have recently been acquired by Viacom, Fox and NBCU respectively. In addition to moving to where viewers are, advertisers also benefit from applying data to their TV campaigns for the first time. For example, after the COVID lockdown started, a large U.S. insurance company wanted to be more data-driven in their TV spend. Their goal was to extend reach while managing frequency. Using a third-party measurement firm through our platform, the results were transformative. Even though CTV CPMs are roughly 3 times those of linear CPMs, using CTV lowered the cost-per-unique household by over 2.5X. Even more eye opening for the brand, using CTV on our platform, they were able to reduce ad frequency to the consumer by over 80% compared with their previous linear campaigns. In this case, site visits were 2X more efficient when using data-driven CTV versus publisher data. Overall, this resulted in a significant reduction in cost per acquisition. As I see advertisers question the value of user generated content, and as they make CTV a more important element of their media mix, I also pick up a more unified sense from advertisers that they want to put more pressure on the industry to uphold certain standards. One of the attractions of CTV is that it's a more competitive market than UGC, with the standards that typically come with competition. No studio, no channel, no cable company, no MVPD, no one company has the leverage or resources to achieve the market dominance enjoyed by Google in search and Facebook in social. And because we continue to predict video in all its forms will account for about half the trillion-dollar advertising market, we believe that CTV may well be the catalyst that eventually forces all walled gardens to change course. It's important to remember that in the great scheme of things, the digital advertising industry is relatively young. As with any market that emerges, there comes a time when key participants demand certain market rules. Things like transparency and objectivity. And that's what I see happening now. CTV may be the most vivid example, but you can also look at how advertisers are now having to do more with less, how they are demanding better measurement transparency, and more market objectivity. You can even look at various regulatory initiatives within our industry, whether it's here in the U.S., or in Australia, or Europe. There's pressure on all fronts within the system to have the advertising market conform to the norms of other mature markets. And as I speak with advertisers, they put the debate regarding the future of identity in that exact same context. Which is the third point I want to touch on today. We can discuss the specifics of any one identity offering, and we are examining all of them, but at the core of it are two critical questions that advertisers and publishers think about: How do we explain the value exchange of the Internet and the role of relevant advertising to consumers? And how do we ensure power doesn't become too concentrated in one place? The moves that Apple announced recently with IDFA represent a step forward. When a consumer logs in to an iOS app, they will be asked to opt-in to tracking in return for personalized ads. That's a partial step toward explaining the value exchange of the Internet - the understanding that we get to enjoy premium content and experiences in return for relevant advertising. Google is going through the same process. But the issue is complicated for them by the dominant position they enjoy in digital advertising. If they remove cookies from the Open Internet in Chrome and rely on proprietary logins for the advertising business which makes up almost their entire revenue stream, even if using privacy as a shield - it may be seen as an overreach by regulators. In dollars and sense, I don't think the risk is worth it to them. I expect that they will find a way to preserve relevant advertising for all of the reputable advertisers and advertising platforms in Chrome. Regardless, we have to prepare for a world without third party cookies. Fortunately, we've successfully launched and built a ubiquitous ID before - our Unified Open ID. When we developed the first iteration of our Unified ID solution, the core idea was to make sure certain players, particularly Google, didn't have an unfair cookie coverage advantage over the rest of the internet, and particularly the open internet. This was a huge success as every major SSP and exchange has adopted this ID, which is more important than ever. As more advertisers embrace data-driven advertising, especially with the CTV surge, they want to ensure that the market is competitive and that they can compare one media property to another. That kind of measurement and comparability is key, and it's not possible within walled gardens. Following the guidelines outlined by the IAB's Project Rearc, we've been focused on ensuring that the next phase of Unified ID will help empower the open internet beyond just cookies. Development is underway with a focus on a few core characteristics: First and most importantly we need an Open ID, which is a major upgrade over current cookie technology, and which will include a hashed and encrypted ID with improved accountability measures. Unlike a cookie, this ID does not live in the browser. This ID can be used in a browser or on any type of device, including a phone or a connected TV and this ID will be free and open-sourced Second, Granular and understandable consumer controls, with the option to opt-out. Third, A simplified consent framework for publishers, which explains the value exchange of content in exchange for relevant advertising for consumers. And Fourth, Single sign on capabilities across the open Internet - so consumers don't have to consent over and over again. We won't go this alone of course. As with our initial Unified ID solution, we will work with the industry to drive consensus and standards, and to ensure we build a solution that will drive the required critical mass of adoption. We're in development and we expect to have beta versions of this solution in market soon. This work is important because cookies are an archaic technology that need to be upgraded. That said, I'm still not convinced that Google, in the end, will get rid of third-party cookies. And even if they do, cookies will be replaced with something else that enables targeted advertising. I do not believe that Google will have the ability to turn off targeted advertising for everyone but them. As I said, advertisers and publishers are starting to demand the kinds of market rules for digital advertising that we've come to expect with other mature markets, such as financial markets. Independence, objectivity, and auditable measurement are more important to advertisers than ever before. We're driven to maintain and build a free and open internet that honors the quid pro quo of the internet. We want an internet that is better for consumers as well as advertisers and publishers. As advertisers commit more of their budgets to digital, especially as they shift more of their TV dollars to CTV, they want to know that they can reach the right audiences, that they can measure and compare performance, and that they can support the right content for them. The move toward a more contemporary approach to identity will be key in building that trust for advertisers. Let me close by just reiterating the consistency of these themes among advertisers. If, like me, during COVID, you've been sucked into the world of online webinars and events, you'll have heard many of the same themes. But I'm excited by it. Advertisers are more tuned in to the power of data-driven advertising than ever before. They understand the role it can play in helping them be agile in the midst of today's uncertainty. They understand it can help them gain market share. And as they embrace it across their advertising channels, they are demanding more of our industry. This has been an important moment for The Trade Desk. 2020 is a moment where the culture we have built over the last decade is paying dividends, perhaps more than ever. Also, we have always been a company with a vision and a mission, and that has been more valuable in 2020 than any moment in our past. And that's always been our approach. We've spent 10 years getting ready for this moment. While we still have a great deal of uncertainty in front of us, we're very excited about the future. Now, let me turn the call over to Blake to discuss our financial performance. Well, thanks, Brian appreciate the question and the kind words. So yes, so let me start with the punch line. So I think connected TV and television in general has changed forever because of COVID-19. And nothing is going to undo the change that has been instigated. Is there some amount of viewership that is currently on AVOD that will go back to sports or something like that? There is some amount of that, but I'm really drawn to a couple of the big vector number. So first of all, we highlighted in the prepared remarks that cord cutting is typically been around 3% a year is according to our research expected to be around 11%. That's largely because the number one reason that people hang on to cable is sports at 60% of people saying that's their number one reason for hanging onto it. Even a sports comeback, the sports aren't nearly as watch as desirable as they were. But intimately, it's really important to note that as they are coming back, we're getting access to all of them. So even in their limited forms where a lot of people seeing them on demand and we're showing ads for the NDA. The major league baseball, major league soccer, tennis, even UFC - so we're showing ads across all the sports that are coming back. Of course, we've also seen a large surge in unemployment. And that of course, makes everybody and those that have been affected negatively economically, which is almost everyone to look at their TV line up and say what's the most expensive part and where do I need to cut and that almost always leads the cable television. It's really important, and I didn't emphasize this enough in the prepared remarks that cable television and connected TV are both. I think at a really important point, which is that the number of households that we can reach just passed in this quarter, 80 million households. And according to the projections that we have for this year, cable households are subscribers will drop below 80 million for the first time in many years. So there is a bit of a changing of the guard that's happening right now and I don't expect that to ever change again. So I guess the punch line to your question is that CTV has changed the landscape forever. The effects of C-19 have changed them forever. There might be some noise as things get back to normal. But as they get back to normal, people are moving, where they want to go, which is on-demand. So first, whenever we started to talk about IDs, it's really easy for me to lose people in the technical details. And so I always like to start with the headline and then just reinforce the headline as we finish, which is I'm extremely confident that The Trade Desk is going to be fine no matter what. I'm extremely confident that quid pro quo of the Internet cannot be disrupted by a single company, whether they are dependent directly on advertising or indirectly on advertising. With that as prefix Apple is indirectly dependent on advertising for what I believe to be the most valuable asset that Apple has which is their app marketplace. So people often make the point that Apple is not in the advertising business. And that's true they're not directly in the advertising business. But they are indirectly in the advertising business which is most of their apps and their ecosystem, again, which I believe to be their most valuable asset are dependent on ads in some form. All of that said, it's only about 10% of our spend uses IDFA in anyway. And one thing that I think is really important to remind everybody else is that we look at millions and millions of ad opportunities every single second, ballpark call 11 million. And with that 11 million, if you were to take away 1 million and say, now you have to fulfill all of your budgets, with only 10 million ads available every single second. We would be just fine. We would just buy a different 10 million. So if IDFA were to go completely away or everybody were to opt out, we would just buy different apps - so it wouldn't have much impact. That said, because Apple is dependent on that, I don't expect that and there might be some short-term surge in opt-outs. But because Apple has made clear that they will do a better job of explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet, which by the way is amazing progress, that's good news for everybody. I do think long-term when people go to apps and find that they don't work as well because in fact you do need to share your location with the Yelp in order for it to work at all. The long-term, everybody is going to become more familiar with the quid pro quo of the Internet and will have access to nearly the same amount of inventory that we have today. So, I don't expect there to be any major disruption in the short-term or the long term. I'm even more confident that there won't be any meaningful disruption in the long-term, which comes to the second part of your question which is Google. If I'm Google especially when I've already made the announcement about the future of cookies inside of Chrome and they've been - Sundar was asked about it directly multiple times in the recent hearings. I'm not going to start this - I'm not going to start a fight on another front. And especially, because here at Google and I'm speaking as if I'm them. We are dependent on ads. So unlike Apple, which is indirectly dependent on ads, we are 95 plus percent of our revenue, I think comes from ads. But so, we're going to wait and learn from what happens with Apple and then make changes. But if Apple overreach, we will benefit because app providers will then start building to our platform first, instead of the Apple's. And then we will gain more market share. So if I'm working at Google, I'm secretly hoping that Apple messes it up, so that we can win share. But given the number of places that - sort of Google is under attack, I would be waiting and watching before acting. So I think both of the strategic positions that they're in their means, that's the quid pro quo of the Internet is just fine, and that brings me back to our headline, which is The Trade Desk is just fine. Yes, so first of all, thanks for the question. So, one of them, I think it's happening right now and it's sort of indirectly related to connected TV and that is for the first time, a massive amount of really premium content has come into data driven Internet, fuel media and that's AVOD and all the content that's come in to connected TV over the last few years. And so that just changes a number of choices that advertisers have. And so what's really important that they do, and this has really been instigated an accelerated this year is evaluate what is the value of premium content on a relative basis to everything else, especially user generated content. And so I'm really impressed by number one, how much content has come online and how much viewership has come online. I noted the Wall Street Journal made the comment that Disney+ has picked up as many subscribers in the last roughly year as Netflix did in its first eight years. Peacock just launched in July and is off to a good start. We quoted numbers from Pluto and Tubi and others, when we're talking 3x growth in April at 100% growth in April. So all of that coming online at the same time that people are having a discussion about the relative value of premium to UGC is a really important thing to keep unlocking dollars. Also just in general measurement is probably the long pole in connected TV. So this relative value is an important discussion and it also just impacts the measurement discussion, which is the way that GRPs and reach our measured in linear television, it doesn't really penalize advertisers or media companies to show you the same ad over and over and over again, and sometimes that even creates negative brand affinity where if you show me the same ad 100 times, I start liking your brand less. But the way traditional television measurement works, it doesn't penalize that behavior. Rectifying just price and measuring reach and frequency and the fact that you have way more control in connected TV than what you can get with cheap GRPs and traditional television rectifying the way we measure between old TV and new TV is a really important thing that just has to continue to get better, and you'll see us continue to invest in product. We've made some big hires to help us with this, in fact, in this quarter. So it's something very top of mind because that is definitely one of the things that will unlock more spend. But as you can see by the prediction, that we'll do more than double our growth rate of Q2 at 40%. We are extremely confident that in the short term, we'll continue to improve. Yes, thanks. So I've been talking publicly for a few years now about how dissatisfied I am with the way companies like Apple and sometimes even Google have talked about privacy. And especially in the way that they've explained the quid pro quo of the Internet. So we don't always know why we're typing in our Apple ID for the 9,000th time in a month, but it often is because you're getting consent for something that they're not explaining well. And so we look at the current state of discussion on cookies and especially - really this started with GDPR where regulators rightfully said Internet players need to better explain the quid pro quo of the Internet and you need to just give notice in the case while you're providing targeted advertising to pay for your content. And the response to GDPR in part because people didn't quite know what to do with often do just say things like there are cookies, there are cookies on my site. Instead of explaining what those cookies do and explain how the quid pro quo of the Internet works. So what we want to do and what we've announced and we've developed, it is a framework for making that quid pro quo of the Internet better. So we spend a lot of time thinking about how cookies can be improved upon, how we could create an alternative to cookies and make that available to everyone else. So unlike many of the big players in tech who come up with a solution like this and then say, great, now, I can have proprietary advantage over everyone else. All we want is an ecosystem that is better and we're fine if it benefits everyone including Google and Facebook and others. And as our product, we expect to be successful and part of the reason we expect it to be successful is because it is better for all the major players and therefore it's easier for us to invite them to participate. And so, as we mentioned one part of this is that there will be an ID. Historically, all of this in a third-party cookie is an ID, a random number and this ID what actually be encrypted, it would also come with terms of service that are regulated by the ID which is better than cookies on both fronts. It also comes with better opt out so that publishers can actually better explain the quid pro quo of the Internet and we're going to be more prescriptive with publishers as to what we expect them to say so that they better explain that and we're going to spend more money with the publishers that do a better job of explaining that quid pro quo. We're also going to give a framework to companies like Apple, so when they update iOS like they are about to and they give consumers control, we'll give them a place to send us that information so that we can honor. And then we'll also create the most lightweight simple FSO available so that especially long tail publishers will continue to be competitive. If in fact Google were to get rid of third-party cookies and say, well we have logins so we'll use those to our benefit, the long tail publishers, in particular, would be the ones to get hurt. And so by offering them something that is very lightweight as well as not trying to take anything from them, we think it makes it possible to create a much better Internet for everybody. So just like unified ID and I want to be very clear on this, we do not need to go get billions of consumers to sign up for something in order for us to succeed on this. All we need to do is get a few of the most forward thinking publishers and SSPs and exchanges to understand and adopt and then it will be successful because we've already shared this with one of the biggest advertisers in the world who responded by saying, what can we do to help, we'll do everything including getting on stage and talking about how important this is, which that they will come. Secondly, we've already presented this to several of the most sophisticated SSP and exchanges. And they've said - one of their CEO said, this is going to work, it couldn't be pulled off by anybody. But you guys because of the position you play in the ecosystem and it's going to work, what do we have to do to help, tell us what we can do to be a good partner. And that's the general sentiment across the space. So all it requires in order to be successful is adoption from the most sophisticated players in our space and we're extremely confident that just like with unified ID 1.0 we can do that again. So it's a very bold initiative, which will really benefit the entire Internet and we're optimistic that we can do it again. Thanks for the question. So in CTV, it is definitely the case that we have benefited from upfronts being weak and as we talk about a perfect storm in traditional television, that could never be more apparent than what happened to this year's upfronts especially because the sharp downturn that the economy especially advertising experienced between the middle of March and middle of April is also the exact time of when the upfronts is, which is, again end of March and April. So we definitely benefited from that being taken out and we definitely benefited from live sports being taken out of traditional television. As sports comes back, I think more and more people are going to be watching it, streaming and we'll benefit from that. As it relates to the mix in total percentage of revenue, we just don't comment on that yet. And the reason why we don't, is just as it's growing at such an amazing rate, we don't want to have to constantly be explaining any change in the shape of the curve that are just blips. But the general direction is all up into the right. We expect that to continue. And of course, when we're growing it, as you point out, 40% this quarter and over 80% next quarter where of course connected TV is leading the way. So if there is any other color, I can give on that, that's more a qualitative, it's simply that our sales team is leading every conversation with connected TV and connected TV is leading the recovery inside of programmatic. On the second question, as it relates to China and just international expansion, there are definitely markets that have been more negatively impacted from COVID than others. And so I think this is going to have a disproportionate effect for good and bad on every market. So every market will be different than they were before. Important to note that of the 25 offices that we have around the world, we only have a handful of them that are open today and the very first one that open was China. They went back to work very first. The numbers that they are putting up specifically are very impressive as a growth rate, but it's also compared against relatively low numbers and as we would say easy comps. So I'm really encouraged by what's happening in China. As it relates to the geopolitical and just that whatever increased tension has come through the back and forth of leaders and attention between the two countries, I think I've noted before. I think there is an economic dependence between each other, meaning, between the U.S. and China that no one can really disrupt, it's not dissimilar from what I talk about the quid pro quo of the Internet, cannot be disrupted the way that products are manufactured and where the biggest consumers in the world are, the biggest manufacturers in the world are, that creates a independence or co-dependence that is so great that I don't think that that can be meaningfully disrupted even though speed bumps can be created. But I just keep looking at it as it's the second largest media market in the world. We definitely save that one for later in our growth cycle, but we have amazing relationships with Baidu, Alibaba Tencent. Our TikTok relationship that started in Asia, it started very strong and we continue to have great expectations for that around the world and just continue to make investments and we continue to see things move up into the right. So first as it relates to a percentage of our revenue, we've never broken that out and we don't break it out for a number of reasons not least of which is that, I look at data as something at times, I'm willing to give away in an effort to just help people buy more media, more intelligently. And if that makes our clients more sticky and more invested and especially, see more ROI, I can make up the money that I could have made in charging for that by getting another dollar, if you will. So, meaning, getting another dollar media spend. So we're always making that trade-off, but I'd like to address the sort of bigger picture question that you framed because I think that's really important. And if I even rephrase your question, which is to say, hey, there is a lot of discussion happening with IDFA, with a third-party cookies going away inside of Chrome. There is a lot of things that are saying the way that quid pro quo of the Internet works may change. And if that change, not that the quid pro quo will change, but the mechanics of that quid pro quo may change. If they change, will that be good or bad for data companies? And the short answer is, I think it's good for data companies. So right now cookies in particular, create a really difficult way for data to be onboarded. It's actually created more of a barrier than anything else. Data gets applied more easily to things like direct mail and almost every other form of advertising then it does the browsing Internet. And as the Internet grows and as devices get more fragmented, having something that's more common as well as just better consent, will actually create more opportunities for data companies that do the right thing. So data companies that have been aggressive or deceitful, they're going away. Data companies that do the right thing and operate without being too aggressive on collection or on deployment are going to do really well. And I think if you look forward 20 years, there is more of them than there are now, but there is way less deceit on the Internet, 20 years from now than there is now just like there is less now than there was 10 years ago. The political side, sorry. So a lot of questions about how is political going to be different given the environment. There's lots of discussions about even how people are going to vote in this upcoming election. But I don't think there is that much debate though about the fact that more people are going to be home, more of the debate and discussion is going to be hosted over the Internet, largely because people are having this discussion and debate in their own homes, just because of the nature of C-19. I think also the amount of uncertainty has put a little bit more budget closer to the actual election time, there will be \u2013 that it's possible that there's fewer debates and meaning actual debates where the candidates get next to each other. And if that's the case, then I think every candidate and every party is dependent more on the discussion that happens in digital ecosystems and that includes programmatic advertising. So, I think all of that means that this one is going to be more of a digital election, if you will than any ever before. Yes, you bet. I appreciate you're asking it. There is a lot of nuance in this topic. So let me take a step back and try to describe what's happening in CTV as it relates to the mechanics of data driven advertising. So when you're starting the new market, there is this chicken and egg problem. Until you have something to sell, nobody wants to come to your store. If somebody comes to your store, you don't have enough products to sell they don't want to come back. But if you put way too many products in your store then you have people showing up, then you're not going to want to sell the products that way anymore. So there is this chicken and egg problem. And one of the ways that that's getting solved in CTV and has been getting solved over the last few years is to just agree on what the price is going to be or agree on who's going to buy it. And so, the ideal marketplace is to let the market in real-time decide what to pay and decide what inventory to buy, you might not right-size the inventory and you might not right-size the demand. And also because of scarcity, because as CTV has been taking off, right up until this year, there wasn't enough inventory there for people to feel comfortable that they were going to spend the right amounts. So they like to be something a little bit more like a reserve or to have a little bit more of a reassurance that they're actually going to spend. So one of the ways they've done that is to create these private marketplaces where you basically create a deal and you agree on some of the vectors that would otherwise be variables in the future, that includes things like price. So real-time bidding is just another way of saying to leverage more data in real-time, so that you have more of a chance to inspect. While the most sophisticated buyers in the world have made it very clear and that includes people or brands like Procter & Gamble, they have said very loudly they want the power of choice. And they would rather pay a premium and choose what they get and what they pay than to just lock something in and then hand over decisioning to the sell side. That will be more the norm going forward as more and more inventory has come online, more brands are going to say, I'm willing to pay a premium for choice. And given that there is more supply coming on, that's actually an important thing for the supply side to do in order to get that premium. So that is very good for us, that's very good for the industry. In fact, it's really essential for connected TV that things start to move in that direction. So that prices continue to be able to fund the amazing content that all of us get to experience as consumers right now. So, really important question and the trend is heading in the right direction. Yes, so it's an interesting way to put it, which is feed-based advertising versus user generated content. I do think the bigger issue is user generated content even though, you could also make the argument about the feed-based simply because it's harder to determine context. But I think when you're very high level about this \u2013 advertisers have more choices than they've ever had. And they have more data and more insight and they're smarter than they've ever been. And so, I think we're having a very important discussion on the Internet right now about what is the value and the risk of user generated content. And I've just been surprised and I mentioned this in the prepared remarks about how coordinated it seems the Internet has been especially the advertisers, the funders of the Internet. How coordinated they've been in saying, hey, especially as we move in to a pretty heated and competitive election, more people are saying in user generated spaces, your politics suck, you're an idiot. You just don't want that to be a brand that says this conversations brought to you by brand X. And so as a result, there, just looking at that same where are safer places. And if there were anything else to contribute to the perfect storm of traditional television that's contributing to connected TV, it's that because they are then saying, while there is this alternative which is all this premium content that I can advertise on and its premium video. It's a big video on a big screen that I know we'll run, and I know what I get. I know what I'm running next to. It's a very compelling alternative as people are struggling with what UGC or as you put it feed-based ads represent so they're definitely rethinking it."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I hope you're all doing as well as possible in this challenging environment. Before turning to results, I wanted to comment briefly on the status of our company's operations. Today, we are currently operating with the majority of our full-time employees working from home. Safety is the number one priority for our team. We fully support our employees as they either continue to work from home or return to the office based on their preference and where allowed by local regulations, and in Q2 we were pleased to continue to onboard positive net new employees every month, investing in talent that we believe will deliver future value to our clients. Given the circumstances, I really can't say enough about the dedication, focus and professionalism with which The Trade Desk team is tackling the challenges presented during this period. Now moving on to our results, In Q2, revenue was $139.4 million representing a decline of 12.9% year-over-year. That said, however, the story that developed over the quarter was a positive one. Coming off the lows we experienced in mid-April, spending trends improved throughout the period and by mid-June turned positive on a year-over-year basis and that has continued into July. As we began to see those improvements, we started to increase the pace of our investments to further capitalize on the opportunity that is presenting itself in our business, particularly in CTV. For Q2, despite the year-over-year revenue decline, we generated $14.6 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 10.5% of revenue. With the investments we are making in our people and our solid working capital situation, we believe we are well positioned for future growth acceleration as conditions continue to improve. From the channel perspective, Q2 included strong year-over-year spend growth, relatively speaking, in branded channels where advertisers can really connect with customers. Here Connected TV was up roughly 40% and audio was up 23% year-over-year in Q2. During the month of July we continue to see improvements across all of our channels. Geographically in Q2, similar to last quarter, North America represented 88% of spend and International represented 12% of spend. Some of the spending trends that I mentioned earlier applied to our regions, as North America, APAC and Europe each improved every month during the quarter on a year-over-year basis. In terms of our verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly every category improved between April and June, with many exhibiting strong resilience. In particular, Health & Fitness, our largest vertical in 2019, as well as Technology & Computing, Home and Garden, and Education continued to perform well. While still improving materially from their April lows, Travel and Automotive lagged behind - although in the last few weeks we have seen Automotive turn positive year-over-year and are encouraged about that. We are actively working with large automotive companies and their agencies to activate more campaigns on the platform. Our early May CTV launch provided an opportunity to showcase our ability to deliver incremental reach, with frequency controls and measurement of real business outcomes. As a result, CTV represented a significant amount of these brands ad spend on our platform in Q2. We believe this represents a growing opportunity in the back half of 2020 and into next year. Operating expenses were $155 million in Q2, up 21% year-over-year. This increase reflects continued investment across areas such as our technical talent and business development teams, but also being mindful of our cost structure in this environment and decelerated from 30% year-over-year growth in Q1. This approach to our operating expenses continues to reflect how we actively allocate capital within the company toward areas that can drive future growth. As spend started to recover we began allocating resources to incremental investments. Our goal is to invest heavily in the areas that can drive growth so we can grab share during the recovery. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.6 million in Q2, representing a 10.5% margin. Income tax was a benefit of $41 million in the quarter mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted Net income for the quarter was $44.8 million or $0.92 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $96.3 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $75.5 million. The primary driver for the increase was a change in working capital that can vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of payments and receivables. DSOs exiting the quarter were 96 days, down six days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days, down seven days from a year ago. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $555 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. I'd like to remind you that depending on the shape of the recovery curve, our liquidity position will fluctuate as we fund our growth. I am going to use the remainder of the time today to discuss Q3 and how we are managing the company through the current environment. Like last quarter, we do not intend to provide financial guidance for the full year. However, we do want to provide direction for Q3. Please be aware, our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has significantly impacted advertiser demand. Like many companies that are ad-funded, we are facing a period of higher uncertainty in our business outlook. We expect our business performance could be impacted by issues beyond our control, such as shelter-in-place orders that may or may not occur. Assuming that the economy continues to open up and we do not have any major COVID related setbacks that may cause economic conditions to deteriorate, we estimate revenue growth in Q3 to increase 8% to 10% on a year-over-year basis. Under this assumption, we estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at least $30 million in Q3. We also continue to be mindful of cash management, maintaining liquidity and investing in working capital as spend continues to increase. From an expense management perspective, while we are increasing our investments today, in light of the current environment, I want to remind you that we do have flexibility should things deteriorate. I'm proud of the agility we exhibited in Q2, and we have those levers, and additional ones depending on the environment, as needed. However, we are certainly encouraged and remain motivated by the stabilization trend in spend we have seen since the middle of April. We believe we have the structure in place to accelerate growth and gain share as economic conditions improve and are cautiously optimistic about continued measured improvement through the remainder of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Sure, thanks for the question, Shyam, I appreciate it. Yes, just to back up quickly, I was really pleased with how we manage the second quarter from an expense standpoint. Despite the COVID headwinds, we still generated nearly $15 million in positive EBITDA for the quarter. Our expense growth deceled, we're up around 30% in Q1 and we deceled up 21% in Q2. So that said, even with the decel from Q1, we're still investing materially in the business and we continue to do so. Like we discussed in the prepared remarks, we did release more investment as we saw trends improve during the quarter. Additional color, I can try to help you with is on the Q1 call you might recall we were targeting our full-year 2020 hiring at more than 50% under our original plan. Today that figure has been reduced, it's probably closer to 30% to 40% as of today. So because of that, the expense growth in the second half, it's likely - if I had to say it's likely closer to what we saw in Q1 from a year-over-year growth perspective than what we saw in Q2. But you know I also would want to add. Remember, we really don't manage to an EBITDA target. We invest where the opportunity is. We invest where we believe the long-term value is, we'll always try and flex around that. And then also we have levers available to us if there was a macro deterioration of any kind. So, we showed that agility in Q2 and I'm really proud of that and so we have not only those levers that we were able to use in Q2, but we also have others available if needed. So we like our positioning where we can invest in growth, but also show the flexibility as needed based on overall macro trends to make the right choices for the company in the long term."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\nChris Toth: Thank you, Operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the call today are our Founder and CEO Jeff Green, and Chief Financial Officer Blake Grayson. Jeff and I are in the office in Ventura and Blake has dialed in remotely. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that, except for historical information, the matters that we will be describing will be forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provides a more meaningful representation of the Company\u2019s operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Hello and thank you for joining us. It\u2019s been an extremely challenging and unusual last few months for the world. But while there will continue to be uncertainties in the near-term, I am very optimistic about the future. Our number one priority right now is the health and safety of our employees, our families, and the communities we live in. As we take every precaution to self-isolate and ensure that we will emerge from this in a safe and healthy way, we are starting to see our customers plan for that future. With that in mind, I want to cover three main things with you today. First, I want to reiterate our solid financial foundation and how we are operating in this environment. Second, I\u2019ll provide some perspective on the most recent market trends and what we are seeing in our industry. And third, where I would like to spend most of my time, I\u2019d like to talk about the opportunity in front of The Trade Desk. While these are very challenging times for everyone, I think there is a shift in media that started about nine weeks ago that is accelerating the move to data-driven advertising. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Connected TV. And even though it is too early to predict exactly when the economy will start firing on all cylinders again, we do have a sense of the role advertising will play in that. And I\u2019m confident that The Trade Desk will be on the front lines of recovery. It will represent a major land-grab opportunity, and our ability to be successful in that environment rests solely in our own hands. As it relates to what global recovery looks like, keep in mind that in order to grow and reopen for business, companies need to get the word out. We believe that data-driven advertising is on the front lines of recovery where advertising fuels and even ignites growth, and where growth fuels more advertising. As The Trade Desk is one of the leaders in data-driven advertising, we strongly believe that we will play a critical role in the global economic recovery. So first, our financial foundation and how we are operating in this environment. As we have said many times on this call, from the beginning we have always prioritized profitability and building a strong balance sheet. We could have raised more venture capital in the beginning\u2014all of our competitors did. In the last few years, we could have spent more of our earnings - like many of our SaaS peers did - given our unique combination of high growth and profitability. We didn\u2019t because we wanted to grow responsibly. We wanted to instill good discipline that would serve us well in moments like these. In short, from the beginning we wanted our business to be sustainable. That discipline and commitment to sustainability is what enables us to focus on what\u2019s valuable to our customers. It allows us to prioritize, innovate and invest wisely. It also has put us in the enviable position of being able to invest in our technology to ensure we stay years ahead of our competition. It\u2019s why we have historically grown so rapidly. We will never be a commoditized player. It also ensures that we can manage our way through this global crisis. We can weather near-term impacts and continue to invest in our business. Our goal is to emerge from this environment a much stronger company. Beyond the balance sheet, we started asking our employees in Asia to work from home starting at end of January. By the middle of March, we had closed all of our offices, and the vast majority of them remain closed. With Shanghai and Hong Kong among the few where most of our employees are already working in the office again. Nevertheless, globally almost everyone is working remotely. Our teams around the world have responded and we are operating almost as seamlessly as if we were all in the office. As a technology company, we are pretty damn good at utilizing the most effective collaboration technology. Whether it\u2019s for customer meetings, internal collaboration, marketing development, or agile engineering programs, we operate virtually, shoulder to shoulder, as much as we possibly can without being in the same physical proximity. Since I founded the company in 2009, our leadership has had regular communication with all employees on a weekly basis \u2013 a weekly all-hands. That has served us well in this environment, ensuring we are all well connected and informed. There have been some really critical all hands meetings over the years, meetings where we announced fundraising, meetings where we explained we were going public, but I\u2019m not sure any was more important than our all hands on Monday March 16 when all employees were working from home and we tried to offer our teams reassurance and guidance. We reminded them that panicking is not a strategy and we have a critical role to play in the economic recovery. That this is a moment for our team to make a difference. Every week since then we have 1,000 people live on every week\u2019s all hands. Our team is incredibly resilient. I\u2019ve always been impressed by the powerful combination of talent and dedication in our people. They believe in our mission to make data-driven advertising as ubiquitous as electronic trading in equities and they believe in our vision of a healthy, thriving, ad funded, open internet. I\u2019m incredibly proud of all of them, in every corner of the world. That said, let me move on to my second point and provide some color on what\u2019s happening in digital advertising and our business, beginning with a sense of how the last couple of months have progressed. We had an amazing start to 2020, $161 million in revenue, up 33% year-over-year. We were tracking ahead of our original projections in January and February. Connected TV was on pace to more than double through the first two months of the year. That strength was partially offset by rapid declines in the second half of March as most advertisers started indiscriminately pausing budgets and indiscriminately reducing budgets. For a brief period of time, programmatic was hurt by one of its greatest features, its agility. You can easily start and stop programmatic campaigns in ways that are not possible in most other mediums, like linear television, that don\u2019t move as fast. The strong growth rates we saw the first two months of the quarter serve as a reminder of how strong the secular tailwinds are for data-driven advertising and The Trade Desk. In early April we saw more advertisers slow spend or hit the pause button, across every channel. Some verticals cut most of their budgets, such as the Travel vertical. Of course, some did remain active, particularly in health and fitness, technology and computing, and home and garden. In late March and early April, some budgets were cancelled to stop expenses at businesses that knew their businesses were taking a hit from the shelter in place movements around the world. However, many businesses were simply pausing campaigns, not cancelling them to refresh the messaging. The way a CPG or pharma company planned to message in January had to be redone. Messaging had to be reworked. Overall, by mid-April the year-over-year spend decline stabilized. And as April progressed, we started to see stabilization and even some improvement. I believe that\u2019s because there was growing realization among advertisers that panic is not a strategy. Advertisers started to adapt to the current environment. For example, restaurants shifted their messaging to \u201cwe are open\u201d, or \u201cwe deliver\u201d. Consumer products companies turned their focus to pantry loading products. And some travel companies started to message that they would waive all change or cancellation fees for bookings. And beyond the present, many advertisers started to strategize about how they emerge on the other side of this pandemic. Let me give you an analogy I\u2019ve shared with our team. Like many of you, I\u2019m sure, I\u2019ve found myself watching a little more TV in the evenings while working from home. One movie I enjoyed a lot was Ford vs. Ferrari. There\u2019s a scene in the movie where there\u2019s a crash, and there\u2019s a cloud of smoke over the track. As the racing cars come into the cloud, they can\u2019t see the next 15 or 50 meters. Everything in that moment is uncertain. But they know exactly how the track is laid out once they emerge from the smoke cloud. So all they can really do with any certainty is start to plan for that. That\u2019s where we are with the advertising industry right now. We\u2019re still in that smoke cloud. We don\u2019t know exactly when it will lift. And we don\u2019t know exactly what the next few meters will look like. But we do have confidence on what will happen once we emerge from this. And we know what the track looks like. We\u2019ve lived it so many times, but now the opportunity is even greater. This is where I asked our team to focus most of their efforts, preparing for the opportunity on the other side of this cloud; the other side of this uncertainty, which brings us to my third main point, the opportunity for advertisers and The Trade Desk on the other side of this. While advertisers are indiscriminate in what they pause or cancel on the way down, they are very deliberate on the way up. While we can be sure that ad spending will return, we expect it to look a little different than it did immediately before this global health emergency \u2013 especially at first. We expect there will be a staggered return. Some industries will lead, while others, such as travel and entertainment, may lag a little. Some countries will reopen earlier than others. Here in the United States, we\u2019re already seeing different timeframes from different states and localities. This makes flexibility and agility super important for advertisers. But overall, there will be a massive land grab opportunity. And I expect that marketing will be a critical success factor in that land grab. Think about it. If you\u2019re Uber or Lyft, for example, your business is largely on pause. And you\u2019re not advertising much right now. But as we start to emerge from this, companies will start marketing more heavily because that\u2019s the moment a company can gain awareness, loyalty and share. Whichever of those two companies markets more effectively, will gain share. And that same scenario will play out across every industry. Marriott versus Hilton. Domino\u2019s versus Pizza Hut, Toyota versus Ford. All of these companies, and every other company out there, is figuring out, right now, how they use advertising to connect with consumers and gain share once the gears of the economy start cranking again. What will they advertise, using what kind of creative, to what kinds of audiences, in precise locations, using what kind of channel, it\u2019s all being strategized right now. And as they increase their spend again, not only will they do so aggressively, but they will do so much more deliberately than ever before. With this kind of market disruption, companies are under maximum pressure to be as effective as possible with every dollar of expenditure, including, maybe even especially, in advertising. In that way, this is not dissimilar to the 2008 recession. Remember, programmatic advertising came of age during that recession. And that\u2019s because ad spend migrated to where the advertising dollars were measureable and comparable. The GFC and downturn of 2008 and2009 was an important learning experience to prepare for this. Back then, display and mobile advertising were the big winners. They won despite being weaker at winning hearts and minds than video, TV, or audio. They won share because measureable and comparable are what it takes to win outsized budgets during a recovery. CMOs more than ever have to defend their spending to CFOs, that\u2019s of course best done in data-driven advertising. The same dynamic will happen here. Spend will migrate to what works best. Today it is connected TV and digital audio. Advertisers will apply data-driven advertising more aggressively than they did before this. They will place more value on those ad impressions that are measurable and comparable. Nowhere will this be more apparent than in TV advertising. We\u2019ve talked about the CTV opportunity many times before. We\u2019ve talked about the consumer shift to streaming services. We\u2019ve talked about how broadcasters are moving to streaming platforms. And we\u2019ve talked about how advertisers are eager to apply data to their massive TV ad campaigns for the first time. We thought this CTV revolution would play out across the next two years. But the last eight weeks to 10 weeks have changed all of that. I believe that the media landscape has changed forever starting in the middle of March. Every channel and every participant is in a different position today versus a few months ago, because of one dramatic shift. Linear TV\u2019s shelf life has shortened as viewers have moved, en masse, to CTV. The biggest loser in all of this is traditional, linear TV. And CTV is without a doubt is the biggest winner. Let\u2019s outline why Linear is losing. First, consumers are under pressure. Cable is the most expensive item on the TV menu and there are more choices on the menu than ever with all the new OTT options coming from the likes of Disney and NBC. eMarketer predicted in the summer of 2019 that the U.S. would have what\u2019s become standard a 4% annual decline from 86.5 million households having cable to 82.9 million. We did a survey a few weeks ago with thousands of consumers. Across all households,11% of those who still have cable plan to cut the cord by the end of the year, that number goes up to 18% for the 18 to 34 year-old age group. Compared with eMarketer\u2019s estimates, that would be a massive and unprecedented acceleration to cord cutting. Second, according to the same survey, of those that still have cable, the number one reason they were hanging on to it was sports. In fact, according to our research, 60% of those with cable keep it primarily for live sports. The longer live sports remain suspended, the more these audiences move away from those expensive TV packages Sports being cancelled is a big hit to the traditional linear TV business model. Third, not only is the TV audience shifting, but perhaps just as important, the linear TV revenue model is jeopardized. Often the majority of TV ads are sold in the upfront process. The upfronts are usually done in late April and May and those events are largely suspended this year. According to a new IAB survey of 390 media buyers, planners and brands, Linear TV ad spend will fall an estimated 41% in March and April, and buyers expect to spend 20% less in the upcoming upfront marketplace than they had initially planned. That\u2019s because those big in-person fall preview events in NYC and LA are not happening. And for the most part, they don\u2019t even have any new fall content to preview because production is shut down. There\u2019s only so much advertiser interest in Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres broadcasting from home, much as we love those entertainers. For advertisers, this can be liberating. I hear it from brands and agencies every day. For them, the upfronts are a bit of a burden. They\u2019re asked to commit billions of dollars to content they don\u2019t know much about, chasing audiences they can\u2019t measure. Now they have the freedom to be more deliberate, agile and data-driven in their TV ad investments. Now, before I transition to discuss why CTV is the biggest winner in this shifted landscape, let me make one thing clear. This isn\u2019t case of new media companies versus old media companies. It isn\u2019t Disney and NBCU versus Amazon and Netflix. All four companies and hundreds of others can and do create amazing content. The linear pipes will eventually go away because consumers prefer to watch on demand content. But traditional media companies are adapting even faster to the on-demand nature of CTV. Here is why CTV is winning. First, with the vast majority of consumers largely confined to home, the consumption of on demand TV content has skyrocketed. You only have to look at the incredible numbers posted by both the subscription platforms and the ad-supported services. Second, this proved to be a really great moment for new AVOD launches like NBC\u2019s Peacock. At a moment it\u2019s hard to make content and harder to charge for it. On demand AVOD is skyrocketing. Ad inventory on these platforms has skyrocketed too. Ad impressions are up as much as 30% over the last several weeks, as content providers chase these eyeballs and make more content available on more platforms, 30% in weeks that\u2019s something no one could have predicted. This has led to outperformance in Connected TV. Through the first 20 days in April, we estimated Connected TV spend on our platform increased about 20% year-over-year. Over the last 10 days in April Connected TV spend accelerated even more. During that period, we estimated that Connected TV spend increased about 40%. Third, I mentioned before that programmatic\u2019s agility hurt it when advertisers were mostly cutting and pausing campaigns. However, the agility and data-driven nature of our platform is hugely helpful in winning new budgets. As I said, according to eMarketer, total U.S. households with cable would fall below 82.9 million this year. Our research suggests it could be below $80 million. This year we expect to reach well over 80 million households via CTV in the United States. This is an important point. The Trade Desk is the largest aggregator of CTV ad impressions, across every major content provider and that massive scale is a great leading indicator of future spend on our platform. All of this means that in 2020, The Trade Desk will likely surpass traditional TV in reach capabilities for the first time in our history. We\u2019re already seeing this shift as brands strategize on our platform. For example, a large U.S. based restaurant chain was wary of committing millions to the up-fronts, while their business remains severely impacted. They wanted flexibility in their ad spend. And on our platform they can time their campaign launches when they have more certainty on consumer attitudes and intentions. They also can target by location, where their stores are open. With large upfront commitments and national TV ads this is simply not possible. We are seeing this demand for flexibility and precision across all our verticals. Another recent example was a large technology company that was looking to run a major CTV campaign in a short time frame. They needed the flexibility to act quickly and activate against their target audience at scale. Something that could never be accomplished within the confines of an upfront arrangement. On our platform, they were able to successfully meet their reach and frequency goals for their campaign. To quote them directly: CTV scale on The Trade Desk is a given, but it\u2019s the ultimate flexibility on your platform that makes you the DSP of choice. Fourth, CTV is getting what linear is losing from the expectedly weak up-fronts. It\u2019s one main reason why CTV spend has been steadily increasing. We are winning incremental spend that would have historically been committed in the up-fronts. I do not mean to imply that traditional TV broadcasters are not adapting quickly; they are. Every one of them has either launched or is about to launch a major AVOD platform. Disney has Hulu. Fox has Tubi. Viacom/CBS has Pluto. Comcast has Peacock, Xumo, and recently acquired Vudu from WalMart. And we are partnering with all of them directly. We recently announced that we\u2019re integrating with Comcast\u2019s Freewheel Unified Yield products, which allows advertisers to work across direct buying and programmatic buying seamlessly. For premium content providers, our value is only increasing. Relevant ads, higher CPMs and lower ad loads are the only way content owners can compete with subscription services. To capture this opportunity, our engineers have shipped one of our most important product releases in our history. One of the most interesting features of this launch is the ability for advertisers to manage frequency in TV advertising, across all channels and devices. This is a breakthrough for CTV advertisers. Not only is ad frequency the Number 1 consumer frustration about TV advertising, it\u2019s an issue that has been a problem for advertisers as they shift more spend to CTV. They want the ability to manage frequency as the consumer moves between streaming platforms and their multiple devices. And now, for the first time, they can do that. We also continue to strike partnerships that bring the best premium video content and workflows to our clients. Whether it\u2019s a partnership with TikTok in APAC, which we recently announced or deals with Samba TV, Dish TV, RTL, Channel 4 or Freewheel we continue to outwork our competitors in building an ecosystem that allows them to apply data to the widest variety of premium inventory. You might think I\u2019m a bit of a broken record on CTV but let me reiterate why I spend so much time on it. Advertisers view CTV as a way to break their dependence on Walled Gardens. There is no one dominant player in TV as there is in search or social. TV is a much more fragmented market and the cost of content development means that a single dominant player is very unlikely to emerge. No studio, no channel, no cable company, no MVPD, no one has the leverage to pull that off in TV. And because we think video in all its forms will be about half the trillion-dollar advertising pie, we continue to predict that CTV will be the Trojan Horse that eventually forces all walled gardens to change course. And no company is better positioned than The Trade Desk to grab share from the $200 billion linear TV worldwide market as it moves to digital. So to summarize the hardships for linear TV: Number one, the consumer is under an economic pressure they weren\u2019t a few months ago. Number two, live sports are completely cancelled. Number three, the up-fronts are mostly cancelled. Number four, on demand is a better way to watch everything that isn\u2019t live and consumers are binging right now. And number five, once before all add up to what looks to be an unprecedented year in cord cutting. Let me summarize why CTV is winning. One, everyone is consuming more right now. Two, on demand is better for everything, especially when live sports are paused. Three, CTV is data-driven; it\u2019s measureable and comparable in a way that linear isn\u2019t. Number four, the agility of programmatic is picking up dollars that would have otherwise gone to the up-fronts. And number five, AVOD CTV now has close to the same reach in households that linear does and 2020 may represent the changing of the guard for all television content as a result of the changes in the media landscape. Let me wrap this up by reiterating that we are operating in unprecedented times. As I said earlier, we don\u2019t know exactly when this smoke cloud will lift. But we do have some certainty on what it will look like once we\u2019re through it and we are already starting to see some bright spots emerge such as in Connected TV. The secular transition to data-driven advertising was incredibly robust in January and February. But then advertisers just hit the pause button and they did so somewhat indiscriminately. We were impacted because programmatic advertising is easy to just switch off when you have to very rapidly take stock of a changing environment. But what we\u2019ve seen since then is a much more deliberate approach. Advertisers are being much more strategic and data-driven in their decisions as they adjust for the present, and plan for the future. And we will benefit more than most in this recovery as a result. We are already seeing some very positive signs. The front-line industries in the recovery things like: technology, home & garden, consumer-packaged-goods. They represent some of our largest sectors. We will be on the front lines with them, helping them make every advertising dollar count. Data driven precision will be more important than ever. Think about it. Even today in the U.S., cities are reopening at different speeds in different ways. If you\u2019re an advertiser, you need to be able to tailor your message to specific regions at specific times. That can only be accomplished on a platform like ours. And advertisers are eager to jump back in, some already are doing that. Because they understand the recovery will present an opportunity to grow share in that crucial land-grab time. They understand the role advertising plays in driving their growth, and that growth will drive more advertising. Indeed, in the last 10 days of April we saw a gradual improvement in spend on our platform to a negative high-teen\u2019s year-over-year decline, which is an encouraging early signal. A major contributor to this is the relative performance of CTV which has increased about 40% in those same 10 days. While programmatic may have been dialed back indiscriminately at the beginning of this crisis, it will be turned back on more aggressively as we recover from it, because advertisers understand the role it plays in driving their own growth. And no company is better positioned to be on those front lines with them than The Trade Desk. And this gives me confidence in our future. As I said at the outset, we\u2019re financially healthy and off to be able to ride out on the uncertainty. And because of our continued investments in our platform, in our inventory partnerships, and in our amazing team, I\u2019m confident that we will gain share and outperform our competition as this starts to happen. I\u2019d just like to close with something that has been a bit of an upside surprise. As they work through this planning with us, many advertisers and agency partners are using this time to upgrade their skills. We recently re-launched our training platform, The Trade Desk Edge Academy and we\u2019ve made it available to anyone free of charge for the first time, through the end of the year. We\u2019ve already had more than 12,000 advertisers\u2019 agency staff, and brand marketers sign up for the new courseware, the single month since we re-launch. Just for a little perspective, through the first six years of the original trading academy, we handed out 11,000 professional certifications. That one data point alone should provide some indication of the skyrocketing demand for data-driven education during this uncertain time. Personally, that too gives me confidence about the future. Let me turn the time to Blake to discuss the financial performance.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I hope you and your families are all doing well and staying as safe as you can in this unique situation. As Jeff mentioned, Q1 was on pace to be a strong quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $160.7 million representing 33% year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA was $39 million. That said, like other ad-funded companies, we saw a sharp deceleration in the second half of March. The Trade Desk was on track for revenue growth acceleration to start this year and we believe we are well positioned for future growth acceleration when macro conditions improve. From the channel perspective, Q1 included strong year-over-year spend growth in Connected TV, Mobile Video, Mobile in-app and audio channels. Geographically in Q1, North America represented 88% percent of spend and International represented 12% of spend. As Jeff had highlighted, in terms of our verticals, during the last two weeks of March and into April, Auto, Shopping, Style & Fashion and Travel were our weakest verticals for those that represent at least 1% of our spend. We saw resilience in Health and Fitness, our largest vertical in 2019, Technology & Computing, Home and Garden and Education. Operating expenses were $150 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year, while Sales and Marketing and Technology and Development costs both grew more rapidly than our revenue, Platform operations and G&A costs both grew at a much slower pace than revenue. G&A\u2019s deceleration was driven partly by delayed corporate events due to COVID-19. This approach to our operating expenses continues to reflect how we actively allocate capital within the company toward areas that can drive growth and efficiency in the future and that we discussed in our Q4 2019 earnings call. Adjusted EBITDA was $39 million in Q1, up 58% year-over-year and representing a 24% margin. Income tax was a benefit of $13.7 million in the quarter mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $43.4 million or $0.90 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $53 million for Q1 and free cash flow was $33.4 million. I am going to use the remainder of the time today to walk you through what I believe are the key considerations in how we manage the company through the current environment. Everything in the near-term is about being mindful of cash management and maintaining a fair level of liquidity. This is about weathering the storm, retaining our operational flexibility with a strong cash position, and managing expenses deliberately to make sure we continue to focus on the areas we believe will drive our future growth, like CTV. We exited Q1 with a very strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $446 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. In the third-week of March, out of an abundance of caution, we pulled down our revolving line of credit. While we do not see a need to use this additional capital in the foreseeable future, we felt it was prudent to take the funds to the balance sheet to provide ample liquidity. We believe the capital on hand provides flexibility for a number of different scenarios, whether it\u2019s a slower than expected recovery or providing ready working capital to fund growth in a rapid recovery, or opportunistic M&A similar to our approach with Adbrain, the company we acquired in 2017. Our DSOs at the end of Q1 were 92 days, a decrease or improvement of three days from the same period a year ago. DPOs for Q1 were 69 days, a decrease of seven days from the same period a year ago. Given the uncertainty in this environment, at this point, we are not providing specific gross spend, revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the second quarter or full year 2020. Because of this and to be as transparent as possible, I will provide an overview of current trends on our platform that Jeff also alluded to earlier. Like other ad-funded companies, we saw a sharp deceleration in spend during the second half of March. Spend for the last week in March ended in a negative mid-teens year-over-year decline. In early April, the year-over-year decline in spend continued to increase. By mid-April, the year-over-year decline in spend stabilized. During the last 10 days in April we started to see more stabilization and then some improvement primarily driven by CTV as Jeff had described. Over that 10-day period, total spend improved to a negative high-teen\u2019s year-over-year decline. There is still a significant amount of uncertainty in this macro environment, so I caution you extrapolating this most recent data. However, we are encouraged and cautiously optimistic by the stabilization trend and improvements in late April. From an expense management perspective, we\u2019ve already taken a number of actions in light of the current environment, and still have additional levers available to us should things deteriorate from today, although as Jeff said earlier we\u2019re seeing very recent signals of improvement. Some of the actions we\u2019ve taken so far include reducing our 2020 hiring expectations by over 50%; pulling back on Q2 marketing costs by over 50%; pausing discretionary expenses like company events, along with the natural pausing of T&E due to the current situation; and right-sizing future facilities capital investments where we can based on updated hiring plans. We entered this crisis period in a position of strength, as our profitable business model with healthy EBITDA margins allows us the flexibility to handle reductions in top-line relatively well. Adding that to our additional liquidity, we believe sets us up to weather this storm better than most companies in our space. While lower spend in the short-term hurts, and our EBITDA will be impacted, we are well positioned, as we emerge from this to gain trust from our customers and suppliers, differentiate ourselves from peers and gain market share. If conditions were to get worse, we have levers available to us to manage cost even further. But at the same time, we believe we have the structure in place to accelerate growth and gain share when things get better, as we believe they will. By balancing those decisions, we believe that once we get through to the other side of this crisis, we will be more ready to add value to our customers by helping them reach more of their customers than we ever have before. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we'll take our first question from Michael Levine with Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Levine: Two questions. One for Jeff, one for Blake. So Jeff, I'd love to dig in a little bit more around CTV in your optimism. I mean, I guess based on what I've been hearing out in the marketplace, it feels like a greater probability that the up-front conceivably breaks and there certainly should be a lot more scatter inventory as part of the mix looking at the 2021, I think for some of the reasons you outlined. So I'd love to \u2013 I'd love to get your $0.02 on how you think the company is able to adapt to that and become a better partner to the media companies? And then for Blake, I'd love to hear more about your expense management philosophy, just in terms of areas you're going to lean in more aggressively versus not beyond the comments you call \u2013 you call that in your prepared remarks?\nJeff Green: Hey, first of all, thanks for the question Michael. Yes, I'm excited to start by talking about Connected TV because it's the part of our business that I'm absolutely most bullish about. Of course, we started the year on pace to more than double in Connected TV. And that's in large part because there were lots of AVOD options being presented to consumers even before the pandemic. It's really just been a perfect storm for linear television. I was talking to a woman this morning who has been an exact in television for the last 30 years, and just talking about how we've never seen anything like this. And it's really an unfortunate timing for television in the sense that that typically upfront and guarantees are made at the end of April and early may. That's a moment where people have some visibility into the line-up for linear television for the year. And this year there's just no visibility. That will push things to the scatter market, but we'll also push things to the spot market, which is what programmatic is. What all of them are doing is scrambling to make more of their programs available in Connected TV options because they know that people are watching on demand. As we highlighted in the survey that we did, which I find that to be one of the most insightful pieces of research that we've ever done. We highlighted that the primary reason that people are hanging on to linear television subscriptions or to their cable bill, 60% of the time is because they want live sports. And of course this is an environment where you don't have that. So I think the upfront coupled with just the current environment are making it so there's lots of moves to Connected TV and that is another way of saying the spot market \u2013 the data-driven spot market. Blake, you want to take the expense question?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. You know, I guess what I would have to say about our expense philosophy is that our guiding principle is to continue generating quality positive EBITDA over the long-term. The focus now that we want to take is to balance our expense base to stay flexible. So that staying flexible in order to be ready to grab share in our recovery or, and also be disciplined in case the recovery takes longer than we expect and we have additional levers still available to us. One data point that might be helpful is, excluding stock-based comp the actions that we've taken to-date that I referred to in the prepared remarks, they reduced our cost base by over 10% from our original actions that I refer to include reducing hiring expectations by more than 50%, reducing Q2 marketing costs by more than 50%, pausing various discretionary spend like events, some T&E and other areas. And it's important to remember we have other levers still available to us and we'll just adapt based on how the macro environment unfolds.\nMichael Levine: Thank you so much.\nJeff Green: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Shyam Patil [Susquehanna Financial Group]. Please go ahead, sir.\nShyam Patil: Hey guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for all the color on the current trends. Jeff, as you mentioned on the call, this is a time of significant uncertainty, but over time as things return to normal, do you see yourself getting back to the growth rates that you were at previously, the 30% to 40% or higher growth rates? Just wondering if you could just talk about that and just kind of how you see that in terms of the key drivers? Thank you.\nJeff Green: You bet, and thanks for the question Shyam. So this is a moment where there's just not a lot of visibility. So I'm not eager to sign-up for specific numbers over the long-term, but I will say that the opportunity in front of us now is bigger than it's ever been. I'm more bullish on the long-term and because of the fact that we started January and February accelerating our growth again it's certainly not out of the question that we could see that acceleration resume, you have to make a lot of assumptions about what happens in the macro in order to get there. But what has really just happened is that linear television was decaying at a 3% or 4% rate pretty steadily for the last five years. And that has just accelerated because of all the things that we talked about in the prepared remarks. So because of that acceleration, our opportunity has gotten bigger and it just happens to be that this is the year that we also project that the reach of Connected TV will rival and even surpassed the reach of linear TV. So, which I would argue is the feature of linear TV. So I'm more bullish than I was three months ago on the future of Connected TV and our role in it. There's a lot of uncertainty on specific numbers and whatnot, so just not able to sign-up for that at this moment, but my bullishness is higher than ever.\nShyam Patil: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead, sir.\nTim Nollen: Great, thanks. I've got another one about TTD and the up-fronts. Jeff, appreciate your comments. Agree with basically everything you're saying in general. The up-front typically run on Nielsen ratings. So I'd add to your comments about how difficult the difference will be to get done this year, that it'll be very difficult to do guarantees? So I'm wondering what things are buyers and sellers looking at now. What are you talking with them about as we go into the up-front? And the difference of reach is even [indiscernible] we used to reach a large number of consumers who want ads. Now it's about reaching consumers in different households that you couldn't reach on TV anymore. So I'm just wondering sort of what things are you talking with advertisers [indiscernible] as you go into this up-front or not up-front? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yes. So, I love the question because one of the gating issues for growth in Connected TV from an advertiser perspective has been the ability to measure, and it's not because measurement isn't better in Connected TV, it is. It is far better in Connected TV and in all things digital than it is in linear television. But it's new and one other thing that CTV has going for is that Nielsen is sort of a gold standard. It's the only way really to measure. And so the way that we have competed with that and the way that we've made the transition relatively easy, is that we've leaned on Nielsen in the same way of measuring linear television to give that as a baseline in digital and then add to that and every report, on every impression run additional metadata on where you're reaching people, how frequently you're reaching them. One of the biggest issues that linear television has is that you can't really manage reach and frequency. So if you go do a deal with one media company or on one station or even on one show and then do it on another one, you don't necessarily know who you're reaching the same user. And there's no way at a fine grain to know how much waste there is. You're just measuring how \u2013 if you reach them, not how often you touch them and that's something that digital has improved on dramatically, and that's one of the ways that Connected TV and digital is able to afford to reduce the ad-load and increase the relevance, while making all the content fundable. And so, all working in our favor but it's coming from \u2013 we start with the baseline of the same sort of measurements that we have in linear TV and then improve upon it. So we're already giving customers both of those things today. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Please go ahead, sir.\nVasily Karasyov: Yes, good afternoon. So we hear this when people talk about ad-funded companies, it's all about direct response. Direct response, how resilient it is in this environment and so on. So Jeff, I wonder if you could spend a few minutes talking about brand versus direct response. How it evolves on the other side of this environment. Hopefully, we\u2019ll come out of it soon. And what is the mix of your business between brand and DR? Thank you.\nJeff Green: I'm so glad that you've asked this question and not one that we've ever fielded before. And the reason why is because I like many of you listen to lots of other companies that I've been surprised at how often we've heard the term direct response. I struggled to define which ads you put in the direct response buckets and which ones you don't. Because if you're just talking about it from an advertiser perspective is GEICO or progressive, a direct response company or a brand company? They'd be using brands, but they put a 1-800 number and the URL at the end of every single commercial. They are trying to get you to respond directly as quickly as possible. What has become more synonymous with direct response or performance advertising is actually the way things are transacted. And this is actually really important for us to take a minute and just deconstruct and that's the impressions are often sold on a CPM, that\u2019s the way that we transact. That is the finest grain metric to transact in because you're selling every single impression individually. You can of course sell on a CPC, which is the way most search is sold on a click basis or on an action. So what sometimes you see happen with companies who kind of control the ecosystem end-to-end, whether that's a Snap or a Facebook or a Google or a number of other companies, Twitter. When you have an end-to-end solution, you can take ads on a CPC or a CPA basis and then effectively arbitrage into a CPM. So you can say to an advertiser, okay, I know your ad budgets have been cut, I\u2019ll show the ads and only \u2013 you only pay when we sell something. And then what you can do is, you can increase the number of ads that you show per content, so you can have seven ads per page instead of four and it gives you the ability to maintain some amount of advertiser budget. It's a good way to monetize during a downturn, if you control things end-to-end as many of the walled gardens have done. But because we're not a walled gardens, we don't operate up in any form of arbitrage. We're trying to be transparent and open and we've traded that ability to arbitrage, but for transparency and trust so that we are transacting on a CPM basis and the finest grain possible so that we enable the most amount of price discovery and transparency available in advertising. What happens as markets get healthy as they move back towards CPM and they move back towards just price discovery and just healthy transaction methodologies? Doesn't mean that search is ever changing from CPC or anything like that, but on the rest of the business where there are most transparently transacted on a CPM basis, you'll see movement back to that and less sort of arbitrage. So I don't really count much of our business in direct response because I don't think it's about the way that the ad is actually encouraging action. It's more about the way things are transacted and will continue to stick with the CPM metric because of all the benefits that I just said. Most notably is it, does not compromise our objectivity.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks guys. I had a couple of quick questions. One was on frequency capping and Connected TV and it seems to be a bit of a problem, it's getting better. But we were listening to Disney and they said, look we're moving across our disparate brands to Hulu, ESPN, moving to Connected TV and we're going to lean in on programmatic partners to help us solve this frequency capping problem because they get a better purview across the whole universe. And so they can with our help, we can help them manage their frequency capping. So, first question is, what are you seeing with risks back to that dynamic frequency capping and Connected TV? Is it getting better or getting worse, especially as inventory and advertisers move into Connected TV? And then second question was just in \u2013 with respect to your partnership with FreeWheel for video bidding. Do you see that panning out similar to what happened with header bidding on the display [indiscernible], and that was look at, it added transparency to a market and so that was good. There are dislocations in terms of pricing, so you got some better yields on CPMs and you guys actually crafted a tool out of that dislocation and that chaos predictive clearing built in the [indiscernible]. And so is that tucked into your predictive clearing product? Are there opportunities there to help solve that dislocation with video header bidding? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Thanks Brian. Love the nuance questions and it gives us a chance to dive into the details. Thank you. On the frequency for CTV, yes, it brings me a lot of joy to hear Disney talking in that way because, one, we're also really excited about the partnership with them as we are with so many of the greatest media companies in the world. It is true that because television content especially in digital is so fragmented. It is really hard to manage frequency. I was just talking a second ago about how it's really hard to do it here. It's hard to do in linear and you\u2019re isolated to the number of television sets or set top boxes that you have potentially in order to manage frequency. But now in a world where you have phones and you have computers and just so many ways to consume Connected TV content, it makes it so managing frequency can be even harder because there's just more devices involved, let alone managing people across all those devices. So Connected TV does a better job of this than linear ever can, just because of the nature of the technology or the pipes. We've been doing a good job of it. As you point out, the industry can improve dramatically. That's one of the reasons why I spend a little bit of time talking about the release that we just did about a week and a half ago, which we were already planning to do it. We put all hands on deck to make this one of the most important releases in the history of the company. One of the biggest features, maybe the biggest that we shipped in this is just enhancement to frequency capping to do exactly what Disney is asking us to do, which is just make it better for the consumer, make it better for the advertiser to eliminate waste. I think as of this moment, we're doing a better job of it than has ever been done before. And we'll continue to expand on it because of partners like Disney leaning in. As it relates to the partnership with FreeWheel, yes, we call it header bidding for TV only because header bidding is the closest technological comparison to what's been shipped by FreeWheel. It's not necessarily in the header of course, because it's not a webpage, but the concept is exactly the same. The only thing that\u2019s unifying sort of these silos of demand that are a little bit different between what was happening on browser based traffic versus CTV traffic. And let me explain the difference. In an ad server like DoubleClick in the browser, you have these priorities that effectively siloed the demand. And it just made sense for somebody to write some code, so that I could work as a publisher, I could look and see of all the demand I have, which one's going to make the most amount of money on this particular impression at this moment and it just enables better price discovery. So header bidding was very successful in just sort of working around the ad servers, so the publishers had better visibility and that just created a more robust market for everyone. This is happening a little bit less about the ad server priority, although that might be a little bit of it. It's the direct salesforce in television, where your direct salesforce is out selling something usually without very much targeting at all. And that is in comparison to this data driven or targeted advertising where the CPMs are higher and their data is attached to it and figuring out which buckets I put this particular impression and how does it create yield. FreeWheel has done an amazing job of unifying all that yield, so that content owners can maximize the revenue from the content. And they've taken a page out of the browser yield management playbook and that is definitely serving them well \u2013 definitely serving us well, as we continue to increase spend with them. I think it's also very good for their counterparts and NBC. So I'm really excited at the technology that they're shifting. In my view, they're doing absolutely the right game in combining visibilities of the demand that\u2019s siloed and you're creating the optimal level of monetization for a publisher so that they can continue to afford to produce amazing content, which we all just need to be focused on perpetuating, because it's the best time in arguably the history of television for great content.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Jeff, many are curious about your vision of the shape of the ad spend return. You had mentioned a negative high-teen year-over-year decline in the last 10 days. And when you listen to some of the commentary from a lot of the companies that are reporting, they're saying, the U.S. feels like it's bottom and you're seeing improvement week-over-week and it seems like obviously you're seeing a lag here, can you just talk to, how you think this rebuild in the shape of this and what it looks like throughout the year? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Yes, there's a lot of macro that has to be taken into account to make any really good predictions. I mean \u2013 I can talk a little bit about what we've seen in our business and just to reiterate some of the things that Blake said and maybe give a little bit more detail. So, by the way, when I'm finished, Blake, if there's anything you want to hide or clarify or add to it, feel free of course. So, a slowdown that started in the second half of March, there was some amount of acceleration into April, in the middle of April. We saw some stabilization and then we've seen improvement since then. I think it's really important to talk about where we're seeing those green shoots in the time since mid-April when we saw that near bottom to today. First, companies are not all going to recover at the same pace. And if you think about this from a consumer standpoint, you're probably more likely to go back to work and be comfortable being in your office than you are on an airplane tomorrow. There's just going to be some differences, when you're willing to go do certain activities, even though the recovery, a lot of people are optimistic that things happen very quickly. I'm not certain the things will be back to normal right away. Certainly in the verticals that we're seeing spend, there's some indication that's the way the rest of the world looks at it too. It's not just from a consumer standpoint, but that's the way that companies are sort of putting their money where their mouth is. So not surprisingly, you're seeing things like health and fitness, which includes pharma, you're seeing technology and computing, and you're seeing home and garden and some education categories all doing very well at the front end of the recovery. Not surprising, those are the companies that are more likely to be spending right now. If you're a travel company or you're an automotive, you're more likely to be on the back part of the recovery, which there's just fewer green shoots to point to at this moment. But overall I'm encouraged by the trend I see, I definitely see green shoots in those categories. But where I get, of course most optimistic is in TV and in audio where we're just seeing some pretty strong numbers where we're leading sort of out of that bottom with what I think are the most effective channels, which to me is a reason to be bullish about those is if advertising is really about winning hearts and minds, that I'm not certain that there's anything more effective than then video advertising and audio advertising and the fact that those are leading the recovery in those specific verticals. To me, it's a very positive sign. Blake anything I got wrong or you want to add to that?\nBlake Grayson: No, I think you've covered it well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, this is Dan on for Mark. Two, if I could. Just in terms of, we've obviously all seen now the numbers reported and the rates of deceleration from the walled garden companies. Looking, just based on what you disclosed in March and mid-April, Jeff, why do you think the rate of deceleration on Trade Desk ex-CTV are kind of more pronounced than the walled gardens. And how do you think the recovery shapes us versus them? And then in terms of just kind of clients coming to you versus spending through agencies, how has that been trending? I think, you've been getting more spend come you directly has this crisis kind of accelerated that and then what do you think the kind of P&L implications of that long-term? Thank you.\nJeff Green: So, as it relates to the rates of deceleration, why are there more with us than there that was with the walled gardens. The walled gardens often don't break things out much because of the performance advertising or having control over the inventory itself. It when you put all those numbers together, it's not surprising that for instance, if you're in YouTube and you have an increase of impressions, that double-digit increase because everybody's shelter in place. And then you also take on advertisers on a performance basis to supplement your demand, you could offset some of the loss that comes from that. So the theme is \u2013 the thing about what the situation that we're in is that, let's say that, yesterday I got to look at a 100 impressions that I bought 50 of them. Today I get to look at 150 of them and I buy let's say 40 of them just because of pauses or decreases in budget. And then as well the reason I went from a 100 to 150 is because just more impressions available because people are consuming more. In a walled garden scenario that's going to go into their pockets. In our scenario that's going to go into consumer surplus or to our client's advantage where we are now doing a better job of selecting which impressions work for them. So it all gets translated into the efficacy of the ads, which is part of the reason why I'm so bullish about our ability to win share during the downturn, because just the mathematics of programmatic or I get to look at more impression during an environment like this and I have to buy fewer of them. So I get to be more selective, that difference plus the way things are transacted amounts to a difference in our numbers in the short-term, but in my view in the long-term, that will work to our advantage. And then the second part of your question, sorry, is about the direct versus agency. And so well, it is absolutely true that we're having more conversations with brands directly than we ever have before, largely at their request, often at the agency's request, where they're asking us to go arm-in-arm with them to talk to brand so that we can service them better. We definitely have a brand signing directly with us than ever before, so that they can control the activation of their data. And then they are leaning on their agencies for guidance and for strategy and for execution. We see more and more of that, but we're really optimistic about the continued relationship between brands as well as the agencies. I think there's a little bit more pressure on the agencies in this environment than there was before, which might create a little bit more in-housing. It definitely \u2013 this environment definitely makes it, so that brands are being more scrutinizing of where every $0.01 is being spent. But I think in almost all cases that's very good for programmatic and it makes it so the brands are going to be more deliberate about spending where things are measurable and comparable and there's no place where I think that's better than in programmatic. So it's an opportunity for the agencies that to add more value in this moment, but without a doubt that the brands are going to be more involved going-forward because they want to make deliberate choices.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\nOperator: All right. Next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer, please go ahead, sir\nBrian Schwartz: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Jeff, I want to ask you a question about your investment strategy here during the downturn, clearly articulating throughout the entire call, how excited you are about the share shift that you expect to happen in programmatic and Connected TV here, and how the opportunity just got bigger. So I kind of wanted to ask you a different question here, I realized there is a cost here to the margin, but the balance sheet is strong, so doesn't it make sense for you to potentially not slow down hiring here to get the best talent, maybe even invest more to scale the international business faster or \u2013 for an inorganic? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yes, love this question and I'll take the first thing. Blake, I'd love for you to add any color. Blake and I spent a lot of time reviewing and making these decisions together. So when we started to see the downturn in March and in early April you know, as I compared it to a cloud of smoke on the prepared remarks, you don't necessarily know where that's going to go. So we're really encouraged by what we've seen since the middle of April. And so we definitely have the ability to hit the gas again. I'm really happy that we have such a strong balance sheet that unlike so many other companies who, their car was going 100 miles an hour and they had to come to a screeching halt. We took ours from 100 miles an hour to 80 miles an hour and now we're in a position where we can accelerate if we decide to. So we are in the position where we could do that and we'll gain market share during that time. I don't mind sharing with everybody that during that time, we scrutinize every single piece of incremental headcount, every single role, I personally looked at all of them. Blake and I and team reviewed them all, just trying to go as aggressively as we possibly can while also just accommodating to the uncertainty of the moment. But we absolutely have the ability to hit the gas again and it's not that hard to go from 80 to 100 or 110. It's not nearly as hard to go from zero to 110.\nBlake Grayson: The only thing I'll add to what Jeff said is that we did \u2013 we were super diligent about where we choose to hire for the near term. So just to give you some idea, we said we reduced hiring from our full year plan by 50%, of the remaining hires that we have open right now, 75% of those are in sales and marketing, and technology and development. And those are the areas that will give us the ability to be a catalyst to continue our growth. So we're not slowing the business down, that's really important. We're really \u2013 what we're trying to do is be as flexible as possible in order to gain share in the recovery, but also be adaptable depending on where this all goes. And so that's the kind of a balanced mechanism that we're trying to do.\nOperator: And that does conclude our time for questions today. We'll turn the floor back over to our host Chris Toth.\nChris Toth: Great. Thanks, Karen. Hey, thanks everyone for joining today. We really appreciate your time this afternoon. Stay safe everybody. And we look forward to speaking to you again. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Hello and thank you for joining us. It's been an extremely challenging and unusual last few months for the world. But while there will continue to be uncertainties in the near-term, I am very optimistic about the future. Our number one priority right now is the health and safety of our employees, our families, and the communities we live in. As we take every precaution to self-isolate and ensure that we will emerge from this in a safe and healthy way, we are starting to see our customers plan for that future. With that in mind, I want to cover three main things with you today. First, I want to reiterate our solid financial foundation and how we are operating in this environment. Second, I'll provide some perspective on the most recent market trends and what we are seeing in our industry. And third, where I would like to spend most of my time, I'd like to talk about the opportunity in front of The Trade Desk. While these are very challenging times for everyone, I think there is a shift in media that started about nine weeks ago that is accelerating the move to data-driven advertising. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Connected TV. And even though it is too early to predict exactly when the economy will start firing on all cylinders again, we do have a sense of the role advertising will play in that. And I'm confident that The Trade Desk will be on the front lines of recovery. It will represent a major land-grab opportunity, and our ability to be successful in that environment rests solely in our own hands. As it relates to what global recovery looks like, keep in mind that in order to grow and reopen for business, companies need to get the word out. We believe that data-driven advertising is on the front lines of recovery where advertising fuels and even ignites growth, and where growth fuels more advertising. As The Trade Desk is one of the leaders in data-driven advertising, we strongly believe that we will play a critical role in the global economic recovery. So first, our financial foundation and how we are operating in this environment. As we have said many times on this call, from the beginning we have always prioritized profitability and building a strong balance sheet. We could have raised more venture capital in the beginning\u2014all of our competitors did. In the last few years, we could have spent more of our earnings - like many of our SaaS peers did - given our unique combination of high growth and profitability. We didn't because we wanted to grow responsibly. We wanted to instill good discipline that would serve us well in moments like these. In short, from the beginning we wanted our business to be sustainable. That discipline and commitment to sustainability is what enables us to focus on what's valuable to our customers. It allows us to prioritize, innovate and invest wisely. It also has put us in the enviable position of being able to invest in our technology to ensure we stay years ahead of our competition. It's why we have historically grown so rapidly. We will never be a commoditized player. It also ensures that we can manage our way through this global crisis. We can weather near-term impacts and continue to invest in our business. Our goal is to emerge from this environment a much stronger company. Beyond the balance sheet, we started asking our employees in Asia to work from home starting at end of January. By the middle of March, we had closed all of our offices, and the vast majority of them remain closed. With Shanghai and Hong Kong among the few where most of our employees are already working in the office again. Nevertheless, globally almost everyone is working remotely. Our teams around the world have responded and we are operating almost as seamlessly as if we were all in the office. As a technology company, we are pretty damn good at utilizing the most effective collaboration technology. Whether it's for customer meetings, internal collaboration, marketing development, or agile engineering programs, we operate virtually, shoulder to shoulder, as much as we possibly can without being in the same physical proximity. Since I founded the company in 2009, our leadership has had regular communication with all employees on a weekly basis \u2013 a weekly all-hands. That has served us well in this environment, ensuring we are all well connected and informed. There have been some really critical all hands meetings over the years, meetings where we announced fundraising, meetings where we explained we were going public, but I'm not sure any was more important than our all hands on Monday March 16 when all employees were working from home and we tried to offer our teams reassurance and guidance. We reminded them that panicking is not a strategy and we have a critical role to play in the economic recovery. That this is a moment for our team to make a difference. Every week since then we have 1,000 people live on every week's all hands. Our team is incredibly resilient. I've always been impressed by the powerful combination of talent and dedication in our people. They believe in our mission to make data-driven advertising as ubiquitous as electronic trading in equities and they believe in our vision of a healthy, thriving, ad funded, open internet. I'm incredibly proud of all of them, in every corner of the world. That said, let me move on to my second point and provide some color on what's happening in digital advertising and our business, beginning with a sense of how the last couple of months have progressed. We had an amazing start to 2020, $161 million in revenue, up 33% year-over-year. We were tracking ahead of our original projections in January and February. Connected TV was on pace to more than double through the first two months of the year. That strength was partially offset by rapid declines in the second half of March as most advertisers started indiscriminately pausing budgets and indiscriminately reducing budgets. For a brief period of time, programmatic was hurt by one of its greatest features, its agility. You can easily start and stop programmatic campaigns in ways that are not possible in most other mediums, like linear television, that don't move as fast. The strong growth rates we saw the first two months of the quarter serve as a reminder of how strong the secular tailwinds are for data-driven advertising and The Trade Desk. In early April we saw more advertisers slow spend or hit the pause button, across every channel. Some verticals cut most of their budgets, such as the Travel vertical. Of course, some did remain active, particularly in health and fitness, technology and computing, and home and garden. In late March and early April, some budgets were cancelled to stop expenses at businesses that knew their businesses were taking a hit from the shelter in place movements around the world. However, many businesses were simply pausing campaigns, not cancelling them to refresh the messaging. The way a CPG or pharma company planned to message in January had to be redone. Messaging had to be reworked. Overall, by mid-April the year-over-year spend decline stabilized. And as April progressed, we started to see stabilization and even some improvement. I believe that's because there was growing realization among advertisers that panic is not a strategy. Advertisers started to adapt to the current environment. For example, restaurants shifted their messaging to \u201cwe are open\u201d, or \u201cwe deliver\u201d. Consumer products companies turned their focus to pantry loading products. And some travel companies started to message that they would waive all change or cancellation fees for bookings. And beyond the present, many advertisers started to strategize about how they emerge on the other side of this pandemic. Let me give you an analogy I've shared with our team. Like many of you, I'm sure, I've found myself watching a little more TV in the evenings while working from home. One movie I enjoyed a lot was Ford vs. Ferrari. There's a scene in the movie where there's a crash, and there's a cloud of smoke over the track. As the racing cars come into the cloud, they can't see the next 15 or 50 meters. Everything in that moment is uncertain. But they know exactly how the track is laid out once they emerge from the smoke cloud. So all they can really do with any certainty is start to plan for that. That's where we are with the advertising industry right now. We're still in that smoke cloud. We don't know exactly when it will lift. And we don't know exactly what the next few meters will look like. But we do have confidence on what will happen once we emerge from this. And we know what the track looks like. We've lived it so many times, but now the opportunity is even greater. This is where I asked our team to focus most of their efforts, preparing for the opportunity on the other side of this cloud; the other side of this uncertainty, which brings us to my third main point, the opportunity for advertisers and The Trade Desk on the other side of this. While advertisers are indiscriminate in what they pause or cancel on the way down, they are very deliberate on the way up. While we can be sure that ad spending will return, we expect it to look a little different than it did immediately before this global health emergency \u2013 especially at first. We expect there will be a staggered return. Some industries will lead, while others, such as travel and entertainment, may lag a little. Some countries will reopen earlier than others. Here in the United States, we're already seeing different timeframes from different states and localities. This makes flexibility and agility super important for advertisers. But overall, there will be a massive land grab opportunity. And I expect that marketing will be a critical success factor in that land grab. Think about it. If you're Uber or Lyft, for example, your business is largely on pause. And you're not advertising much right now. But as we start to emerge from this, companies will start marketing more heavily because that's the moment a company can gain awareness, loyalty and share. Whichever of those two companies markets more effectively, will gain share. And that same scenario will play out across every industry. Marriott versus Hilton. Domino's versus Pizza Hut, Toyota versus Ford. All of these companies, and every other company out there, is figuring out, right now, how they use advertising to connect with consumers and gain share once the gears of the economy start cranking again. What will they advertise, using what kind of creative, to what kinds of audiences, in precise locations, using what kind of channel, it's all being strategized right now. And as they increase their spend again, not only will they do so aggressively, but they will do so much more deliberately than ever before. With this kind of market disruption, companies are under maximum pressure to be as effective as possible with every dollar of expenditure, including, maybe even especially, in advertising. In that way, this is not dissimilar to the 2008 recession. Remember, programmatic advertising came of age during that recession. And that's because ad spend migrated to where the advertising dollars were measureable and comparable. The GFC and downturn of 2008 and2009 was an important learning experience to prepare for this. Back then, display and mobile advertising were the big winners. They won despite being weaker at winning hearts and minds than video, TV, or audio. They won share because measureable and comparable are what it takes to win outsized budgets during a recovery. CMOs more than ever have to defend their spending to CFOs, that's of course best done in data-driven advertising. The same dynamic will happen here. Spend will migrate to what works best. Today it is connected TV and digital audio. Advertisers will apply data-driven advertising more aggressively than they did before this. They will place more value on those ad impressions that are measurable and comparable. Nowhere will this be more apparent than in TV advertising. We've talked about the CTV opportunity many times before. We've talked about the consumer shift to streaming services. We've talked about how broadcasters are moving to streaming platforms. And we've talked about how advertisers are eager to apply data to their massive TV ad campaigns for the first time. We thought this CTV revolution would play out across the next two years. But the last eight weeks to 10 weeks have changed all of that. I believe that the media landscape has changed forever starting in the middle of March. Every channel and every participant is in a different position today versus a few months ago, because of one dramatic shift. Linear TV's shelf life has shortened as viewers have moved, en masse, to CTV. The biggest loser in all of this is traditional, linear TV. And CTV is without a doubt is the biggest winner. Let's outline why Linear is losing. First, consumers are under pressure. Cable is the most expensive item on the TV menu and there are more choices on the menu than ever with all the new OTT options coming from the likes of Disney and NBC. eMarketer predicted in the summer of 2019 that the U.S. would have what's become standard a 4% annual decline from 86.5 million households having cable to 82.9 million. We did a survey a few weeks ago with thousands of consumers. Across all households,11% of those who still have cable plan to cut the cord by the end of the year, that number goes up to 18% for the 18 to 34 year-old age group. Compared with eMarketer's estimates, that would be a massive and unprecedented acceleration to cord cutting. Second, according to the same survey, of those that still have cable, the number one reason they were hanging on to it was sports. In fact, according to our research, 60% of those with cable keep it primarily for live sports. The longer live sports remain suspended, the more these audiences move away from those expensive TV packages Sports being cancelled is a big hit to the traditional linear TV business model. Third, not only is the TV audience shifting, but perhaps just as important, the linear TV revenue model is jeopardized. Often the majority of TV ads are sold in the upfront process. The upfronts are usually done in late April and May and those events are largely suspended this year. According to a new IAB survey of 390 media buyers, planners and brands, Linear TV ad spend will fall an estimated 41% in March and April, and buyers expect to spend 20% less in the upcoming upfront marketplace than they had initially planned. That's because those big in-person fall preview events in NYC and LA are not happening. And for the most part, they don't even have any new fall content to preview because production is shut down. There's only so much advertiser interest in Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres broadcasting from home, much as we love those entertainers. For advertisers, this can be liberating. I hear it from brands and agencies every day. For them, the upfronts are a bit of a burden. They're asked to commit billions of dollars to content they don't know much about, chasing audiences they can't measure. Now they have the freedom to be more deliberate, agile and data-driven in their TV ad investments. Now, before I transition to discuss why CTV is the biggest winner in this shifted landscape, let me make one thing clear. This isn't case of new media companies versus old media companies. It isn't Disney and NBCU versus Amazon and Netflix. All four companies and hundreds of others can and do create amazing content. The linear pipes will eventually go away because consumers prefer to watch on demand content. But traditional media companies are adapting even faster to the on-demand nature of CTV. Here is why CTV is winning. First, with the vast majority of consumers largely confined to home, the consumption of on demand TV content has skyrocketed. You only have to look at the incredible numbers posted by both the subscription platforms and the ad-supported services. Second, this proved to be a really great moment for new AVOD launches like NBC's Peacock. At a moment it's hard to make content and harder to charge for it. On demand AVOD is skyrocketing. Ad inventory on these platforms has skyrocketed too. Ad impressions are up as much as 30% over the last several weeks, as content providers chase these eyeballs and make more content available on more platforms, 30% in weeks that's something no one could have predicted. This has led to outperformance in Connected TV. Through the first 20 days in April, we estimated Connected TV spend on our platform increased about 20% year-over-year. Over the last 10 days in April Connected TV spend accelerated even more. During that period, we estimated that Connected TV spend increased about 40%. Third, I mentioned before that programmatic's agility hurt it when advertisers were mostly cutting and pausing campaigns. However, the agility and data-driven nature of our platform is hugely helpful in winning new budgets. As I said, according to eMarketer, total U.S. households with cable would fall below 82.9 million this year. Our research suggests it could be below $80 million. This year we expect to reach well over 80 million households via CTV in the United States. This is an important point. The Trade Desk is the largest aggregator of CTV ad impressions, across every major content provider and that massive scale is a great leading indicator of future spend on our platform. All of this means that in 2020, The Trade Desk will likely surpass traditional TV in reach capabilities for the first time in our history. We're already seeing this shift as brands strategize on our platform. For example, a large U.S. based restaurant chain was wary of committing millions to the up-fronts, while their business remains severely impacted. They wanted flexibility in their ad spend. And on our platform they can time their campaign launches when they have more certainty on consumer attitudes and intentions. They also can target by location, where their stores are open. With large upfront commitments and national TV ads this is simply not possible. We are seeing this demand for flexibility and precision across all our verticals. Another recent example was a large technology company that was looking to run a major CTV campaign in a short time frame. They needed the flexibility to act quickly and activate against their target audience at scale. Something that could never be accomplished within the confines of an upfront arrangement. On our platform, they were able to successfully meet their reach and frequency goals for their campaign. To quote them directly: CTV scale on The Trade Desk is a given, but it's the ultimate flexibility on your platform that makes you the DSP of choice. Fourth, CTV is getting what linear is losing from the expectedly weak up-fronts. It's one main reason why CTV spend has been steadily increasing. We are winning incremental spend that would have historically been committed in the up-fronts. I do not mean to imply that traditional TV broadcasters are not adapting quickly; they are. Every one of them has either launched or is about to launch a major AVOD platform. Disney has Hulu. Fox has Tubi. Viacom/CBS has Pluto. Comcast has Peacock, Xumo, and recently acquired Vudu from WalMart. And we are partnering with all of them directly. We recently announced that we're integrating with Comcast's Freewheel Unified Yield products, which allows advertisers to work across direct buying and programmatic buying seamlessly. For premium content providers, our value is only increasing. Relevant ads, higher CPMs and lower ad loads are the only way content owners can compete with subscription services. To capture this opportunity, our engineers have shipped one of our most important product releases in our history. One of the most interesting features of this launch is the ability for advertisers to manage frequency in TV advertising, across all channels and devices. This is a breakthrough for CTV advertisers. Not only is ad frequency the Number 1 consumer frustration about TV advertising, it's an issue that has been a problem for advertisers as they shift more spend to CTV. They want the ability to manage frequency as the consumer moves between streaming platforms and their multiple devices. And now, for the first time, they can do that. We also continue to strike partnerships that bring the best premium video content and workflows to our clients. Whether it's a partnership with TikTok in APAC, which we recently announced or deals with Samba TV, Dish TV, RTL, Channel 4 or Freewheel we continue to outwork our competitors in building an ecosystem that allows them to apply data to the widest variety of premium inventory. You might think I'm a bit of a broken record on CTV but let me reiterate why I spend so much time on it. Advertisers view CTV as a way to break their dependence on Walled Gardens. There is no one dominant player in TV as there is in search or social. TV is a much more fragmented market and the cost of content development means that a single dominant player is very unlikely to emerge. No studio, no channel, no cable company, no MVPD, no one has the leverage to pull that off in TV. And because we think video in all its forms will be about half the trillion-dollar advertising pie, we continue to predict that CTV will be the Trojan Horse that eventually forces all walled gardens to change course. And no company is better positioned than The Trade Desk to grab share from the $200 billion linear TV worldwide market as it moves to digital. So to summarize the hardships for linear TV: Number one, the consumer is under an economic pressure they weren't a few months ago. Number two, live sports are completely cancelled. Number three, the up-fronts are mostly cancelled. Number four, on demand is a better way to watch everything that isn't live and consumers are binging right now. And number five, once before all add up to what looks to be an unprecedented year in cord cutting. Let me summarize why CTV is winning. One, everyone is consuming more right now. Two, on demand is better for everything, especially when live sports are paused. Three, CTV is data-driven; it's measureable and comparable in a way that linear isn't. Number four, the agility of programmatic is picking up dollars that would have otherwise gone to the up-fronts. And number five, AVOD CTV now has close to the same reach in households that linear does and 2020 may represent the changing of the guard for all television content as a result of the changes in the media landscape. Let me wrap this up by reiterating that we are operating in unprecedented times. As I said earlier, we don't know exactly when this smoke cloud will lift. But we do have some certainty on what it will look like once we're through it and we are already starting to see some bright spots emerge such as in Connected TV. The secular transition to data-driven advertising was incredibly robust in January and February. But then advertisers just hit the pause button and they did so somewhat indiscriminately. We were impacted because programmatic advertising is easy to just switch off when you have to very rapidly take stock of a changing environment. But what we've seen since then is a much more deliberate approach. Advertisers are being much more strategic and data-driven in their decisions as they adjust for the present, and plan for the future. And we will benefit more than most in this recovery as a result. We are already seeing some very positive signs. The front-line industries in the recovery things like: technology, home & garden, consumer-packaged-goods. They represent some of our largest sectors. We will be on the front lines with them, helping them make every advertising dollar count. Data driven precision will be more important than ever. Think about it. Even today in the U.S., cities are reopening at different speeds in different ways. If you're an advertiser, you need to be able to tailor your message to specific regions at specific times. That can only be accomplished on a platform like ours. And advertisers are eager to jump back in, some already are doing that. Because they understand the recovery will present an opportunity to grow share in that crucial land-grab time. They understand the role advertising plays in driving their growth, and that growth will drive more advertising. Indeed, in the last 10 days of April we saw a gradual improvement in spend on our platform to a negative high-teen's year-over-year decline, which is an encouraging early signal. A major contributor to this is the relative performance of CTV which has increased about 40% in those same 10 days. While programmatic may have been dialed back indiscriminately at the beginning of this crisis, it will be turned back on more aggressively as we recover from it, because advertisers understand the role it plays in driving their own growth. And no company is better positioned to be on those front lines with them than The Trade Desk. And this gives me confidence in our future. As I said at the outset, we're financially healthy and off to be able to ride out on the uncertainty. And because of our continued investments in our platform, in our inventory partnerships, and in our amazing team, I'm confident that we will gain share and outperform our competition as this starts to happen. I'd just like to close with something that has been a bit of an upside surprise. As they work through this planning with us, many advertisers and agency partners are using this time to upgrade their skills. We recently re-launched our training platform, The Trade Desk Edge Academy and we've made it available to anyone free of charge for the first time, through the end of the year. We've already had more than 12,000 advertisers' agency staff, and brand marketers sign up for the new courseware, the single month since we re-launch. Just for a little perspective, through the first six years of the original trading academy, we handed out 11,000 professional certifications. That one data point alone should provide some indication of the skyrocketing demand for data-driven education during this uncertain time. Personally, that too gives me confidence about the future. Let me turn the time to Blake to discuss the financial performance. Hey, first of all, thanks for the question Michael. Yes, I'm excited to start by talking about Connected TV because it's the part of our business that I'm absolutely most bullish about. Of course, we started the year on pace to more than double in Connected TV. And that's in large part because there were lots of AVOD options being presented to consumers even before the pandemic. It's really just been a perfect storm for linear television. I was talking to a woman this morning who has been an exact in television for the last 30 years, and just talking about how we've never seen anything like this. And it's really an unfortunate timing for television in the sense that that typically upfront and guarantees are made at the end of April and early may. That's a moment where people have some visibility into the line-up for linear television for the year. And this year there's just no visibility. That will push things to the scatter market, but we'll also push things to the spot market, which is what programmatic is. What all of them are doing is scrambling to make more of their programs available in Connected TV options because they know that people are watching on demand. As we highlighted in the survey that we did, which I find that to be one of the most insightful pieces of research that we've ever done. We highlighted that the primary reason that people are hanging on to linear television subscriptions or to their cable bill, 60% of the time is because they want live sports. And of course this is an environment where you don't have that. So I think the upfront coupled with just the current environment are making it so there's lots of moves to Connected TV and that is another way of saying the spot market \u2013 the data-driven spot market. Blake, you want to take the expense question? Thanks Michael. You bet, and thanks for the question Shyam. So this is a moment where there's just not a lot of visibility. So I'm not eager to sign-up for specific numbers over the long-term, but I will say that the opportunity in front of us now is bigger than it's ever been. I'm more bullish on the long-term and because of the fact that we started January and February accelerating our growth again it's certainly not out of the question that we could see that acceleration resume, you have to make a lot of assumptions about what happens in the macro in order to get there. But what has really just happened is that linear television was decaying at a 3% or 4% rate pretty steadily for the last five years. And that has just accelerated because of all the things that we talked about in the prepared remarks. So because of that acceleration, our opportunity has gotten bigger and it just happens to be that this is the year that we also project that the reach of Connected TV will rival and even surpassed the reach of linear TV. So, which I would argue is the feature of linear TV. So I'm more bullish than I was three months ago on the future of Connected TV and our role in it. There's a lot of uncertainty on specific numbers and whatnot, so just not able to sign-up for that at this moment, but my bullishness is higher than ever. Yes. So, I love the question because one of the gating issues for growth in Connected TV from an advertiser perspective has been the ability to measure, and it's not because measurement isn't better in Connected TV, it is. It is far better in Connected TV and in all things digital than it is in linear television. But it's new and one other thing that CTV has going for is that Nielsen is sort of a gold standard. It's the only way really to measure. And so the way that we have competed with that and the way that we've made the transition relatively easy, is that we've leaned on Nielsen in the same way of measuring linear television to give that as a baseline in digital and then add to that and every report, on every impression run additional metadata on where you're reaching people, how frequently you're reaching them. One of the biggest issues that linear television has is that you can't really manage reach and frequency. So if you go do a deal with one media company or on one station or even on one show and then do it on another one, you don't necessarily know who you're reaching the same user. And there's no way at a fine grain to know how much waste there is. You're just measuring how \u2013 if you reach them, not how often you touch them and that's something that digital has improved on dramatically, and that's one of the ways that Connected TV and digital is able to afford to reduce the ad-load and increase the relevance, while making all the content fundable. And so, all working in our favor but it's coming from \u2013 we start with the baseline of the same sort of measurements that we have in linear TV and then improve upon it. So we're already giving customers both of those things today. Next question please. I'm so glad that you've asked this question and not one that we've ever fielded before. And the reason why is because I like many of you listen to lots of other companies that I've been surprised at how often we've heard the term direct response. I struggled to define which ads you put in the direct response buckets and which ones you don't. Because if you're just talking about it from an advertiser perspective is GEICO or progressive, a direct response company or a brand company? They'd be using brands, but they put a 1-800 number and the URL at the end of every single commercial. They are trying to get you to respond directly as quickly as possible. What has become more synonymous with direct response or performance advertising is actually the way things are transacted. And this is actually really important for us to take a minute and just deconstruct and that's the impressions are often sold on a CPM, that's the way that we transact. That is the finest grain metric to transact in because you're selling every single impression individually. You can of course sell on a CPC, which is the way most search is sold on a click basis or on an action. So what sometimes you see happen with companies who kind of control the ecosystem end-to-end, whether that's a Snap or a Facebook or a Google or a number of other companies, Twitter. When you have an end-to-end solution, you can take ads on a CPC or a CPA basis and then effectively arbitrage into a CPM. So you can say to an advertiser, okay, I know your ad budgets have been cut, I'll show the ads and only \u2013 you only pay when we sell something. And then what you can do is, you can increase the number of ads that you show per content, so you can have seven ads per page instead of four and it gives you the ability to maintain some amount of advertiser budget. It's a good way to monetize during a downturn, if you control things end-to-end as many of the walled gardens have done. But because we're not a walled gardens, we don't operate up in any form of arbitrage. We're trying to be transparent and open and we've traded that ability to arbitrage, but for transparency and trust so that we are transacting on a CPM basis and the finest grain possible so that we enable the most amount of price discovery and transparency available in advertising. What happens as markets get healthy as they move back towards CPM and they move back towards just price discovery and just healthy transaction methodologies? Doesn't mean that search is ever changing from CPC or anything like that, but on the rest of the business where there are most transparently transacted on a CPM basis, you'll see movement back to that and less sort of arbitrage. So I don't really count much of our business in direct response because I don't think it's about the way that the ad is actually encouraging action. It's more about the way things are transacted and will continue to stick with the CPM metric because of all the benefits that I just said. Most notably is it, does not compromise our objectivity. Thanks Brian. Love the nuance questions and it gives us a chance to dive into the details. Thank you. On the frequency for CTV, yes, it brings me a lot of joy to hear Disney talking in that way because, one, we're also really excited about the partnership with them as we are with so many of the greatest media companies in the world. It is true that because television content especially in digital is so fragmented. It is really hard to manage frequency. I was just talking a second ago about how it's really hard to do it here. It's hard to do in linear and you're isolated to the number of television sets or set top boxes that you have potentially in order to manage frequency. But now in a world where you have phones and you have computers and just so many ways to consume Connected TV content, it makes it so managing frequency can be even harder because there's just more devices involved, let alone managing people across all those devices. So Connected TV does a better job of this than linear ever can, just because of the nature of the technology or the pipes. We've been doing a good job of it. As you point out, the industry can improve dramatically. That's one of the reasons why I spend a little bit of time talking about the release that we just did about a week and a half ago, which we were already planning to do it. We put all hands on deck to make this one of the most important releases in the history of the company. One of the biggest features, maybe the biggest that we shipped in this is just enhancement to frequency capping to do exactly what Disney is asking us to do, which is just make it better for the consumer, make it better for the advertiser to eliminate waste. I think as of this moment, we're doing a better job of it than has ever been done before. And we'll continue to expand on it because of partners like Disney leaning in. As it relates to the partnership with FreeWheel, yes, we call it header bidding for TV only because header bidding is the closest technological comparison to what's been shipped by FreeWheel. It's not necessarily in the header of course, because it's not a webpage, but the concept is exactly the same. The only thing that's unifying sort of these silos of demand that are a little bit different between what was happening on browser based traffic versus CTV traffic. And let me explain the difference. In an ad server like DoubleClick in the browser, you have these priorities that effectively siloed the demand. And it just made sense for somebody to write some code, so that I could work as a publisher, I could look and see of all the demand I have, which one's going to make the most amount of money on this particular impression at this moment and it just enables better price discovery. So header bidding was very successful in just sort of working around the ad servers, so the publishers had better visibility and that just created a more robust market for everyone. This is happening a little bit less about the ad server priority, although that might be a little bit of it. It's the direct salesforce in television, where your direct salesforce is out selling something usually without very much targeting at all. And that is in comparison to this data driven or targeted advertising where the CPMs are higher and their data is attached to it and figuring out which buckets I put this particular impression and how does it create yield. FreeWheel has done an amazing job of unifying all that yield, so that content owners can maximize the revenue from the content. And they've taken a page out of the browser yield management playbook and that is definitely serving them well \u2013 definitely serving us well, as we continue to increase spend with them. I think it's also very good for their counterparts and NBC. So I'm really excited at the technology that they're shifting. In my view, they're doing absolutely the right game in combining visibilities of the demand that's siloed and you're creating the optimal level of monetization for a publisher so that they can continue to afford to produce amazing content, which we all just need to be focused on perpetuating, because it's the best time in arguably the history of television for great content. Yes, there's a lot of macro that has to be taken into account to make any really good predictions. I mean \u2013 I can talk a little bit about what we've seen in our business and just to reiterate some of the things that Blake said and maybe give a little bit more detail. So, by the way, when I'm finished, Blake, if there's anything you want to hide or clarify or add to it, feel free of course. So, a slowdown that started in the second half of March, there was some amount of acceleration into April, in the middle of April. We saw some stabilization and then we've seen improvement since then. I think it's really important to talk about where we're seeing those green shoots in the time since mid-April when we saw that near bottom to today. First, companies are not all going to recover at the same pace. And if you think about this from a consumer standpoint, you're probably more likely to go back to work and be comfortable being in your office than you are on an airplane tomorrow. There's just going to be some differences, when you're willing to go do certain activities, even though the recovery, a lot of people are optimistic that things happen very quickly. I'm not certain the things will be back to normal right away. Certainly in the verticals that we're seeing spend, there's some indication that's the way the rest of the world looks at it too. It's not just from a consumer standpoint, but that's the way that companies are sort of putting their money where their mouth is. So not surprisingly, you're seeing things like health and fitness, which includes pharma, you're seeing technology and computing, and you're seeing home and garden and some education categories all doing very well at the front end of the recovery. Not surprising, those are the companies that are more likely to be spending right now. If you're a travel company or you're an automotive, you're more likely to be on the back part of the recovery, which there's just fewer green shoots to point to at this moment. But overall I'm encouraged by the trend I see, I definitely see green shoots in those categories. But where I get, of course most optimistic is in TV and in audio where we're just seeing some pretty strong numbers where we're leading sort of out of that bottom with what I think are the most effective channels, which to me is a reason to be bullish about those is if advertising is really about winning hearts and minds, that I'm not certain that there's anything more effective than then video advertising and audio advertising and the fact that those are leading the recovery in those specific verticals. To me, it's a very positive sign. Blake anything I got wrong or you want to add to that? So, as it relates to the rates of deceleration, why are there more with us than there that was with the walled gardens. The walled gardens often don't break things out much because of the performance advertising or having control over the inventory itself. It when you put all those numbers together, it's not surprising that for instance, if you're in YouTube and you have an increase of impressions, that double-digit increase because everybody's shelter in place. And then you also take on advertisers on a performance basis to supplement your demand, you could offset some of the loss that comes from that. So the theme is \u2013 the thing about what the situation that we're in is that, let's say that, yesterday I got to look at a 100 impressions that I bought 50 of them. Today I get to look at 150 of them and I buy let's say 40 of them just because of pauses or decreases in budget. And then as well the reason I went from a 100 to 150 is because just more impressions available because people are consuming more. In a walled garden scenario that's going to go into their pockets. In our scenario that's going to go into consumer surplus or to our client's advantage where we are now doing a better job of selecting which impressions work for them. So it all gets translated into the efficacy of the ads, which is part of the reason why I'm so bullish about our ability to win share during the downturn, because just the mathematics of programmatic or I get to look at more impression during an environment like this and I have to buy fewer of them. So I get to be more selective, that difference plus the way things are transacted amounts to a difference in our numbers in the short-term, but in my view in the long-term, that will work to our advantage. And then the second part of your question, sorry, is about the direct versus agency. And so well, it is absolutely true that we're having more conversations with brands directly than we ever have before, largely at their request, often at the agency's request, where they're asking us to go arm-in-arm with them to talk to brand so that we can service them better. We definitely have a brand signing directly with us than ever before, so that they can control the activation of their data. And then they are leaning on their agencies for guidance and for strategy and for execution. We see more and more of that, but we're really optimistic about the continued relationship between brands as well as the agencies. I think there's a little bit more pressure on the agencies in this environment than there was before, which might create a little bit more in-housing. It definitely \u2013 this environment definitely makes it, so that brands are being more scrutinizing of where every $0.01 is being spent. But I think in almost all cases that's very good for programmatic and it makes it so the brands are going to be more deliberate about spending where things are measurable and comparable and there's no place where I think that's better than in programmatic. So it's an opportunity for the agencies that to add more value in this moment, but without a doubt that the brands are going to be more involved going-forward because they want to make deliberate choices. Yes, love this question and I'll take the first thing. Blake, I'd love for you to add any color. Blake and I spent a lot of time reviewing and making these decisions together. So when we started to see the downturn in March and in early April you know, as I compared it to a cloud of smoke on the prepared remarks, you don't necessarily know where that's going to go. So we're really encouraged by what we've seen since the middle of April. And so we definitely have the ability to hit the gas again. I'm really happy that we have such a strong balance sheet that unlike so many other companies who, their car was going 100 miles an hour and they had to come to a screeching halt. We took ours from 100 miles an hour to 80 miles an hour and now we're in a position where we can accelerate if we decide to. So we are in the position where we could do that and we'll gain market share during that time. I don't mind sharing with everybody that during that time, we scrutinize every single piece of incremental headcount, every single role, I personally looked at all of them. Blake and I and team reviewed them all, just trying to go as aggressively as we possibly can while also just accommodating to the uncertainty of the moment. But we absolutely have the ability to hit the gas again and it's not that hard to go from 80 to 100 or 110. It's not nearly as hard to go from zero to 110."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you and good afternoon everyone. I hope you and your families are all doing well and staying as safe as you can in this unique situation. As Jeff mentioned, Q1 was on pace to be a strong quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $160.7 million representing 33% year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA was $39 million. That said, like other ad-funded companies, we saw a sharp deceleration in the second half of March. The Trade Desk was on track for revenue growth acceleration to start this year and we believe we are well positioned for future growth acceleration when macro conditions improve. From the channel perspective, Q1 included strong year-over-year spend growth in Connected TV, Mobile Video, Mobile in-app and audio channels. Geographically in Q1, North America represented 88% percent of spend and International represented 12% of spend. As Jeff had highlighted, in terms of our verticals, during the last two weeks of March and into April, Auto, Shopping, Style & Fashion and Travel were our weakest verticals for those that represent at least 1% of our spend. We saw resilience in Health and Fitness, our largest vertical in 2019, Technology & Computing, Home and Garden and Education. Operating expenses were $150 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year, while Sales and Marketing and Technology and Development costs both grew more rapidly than our revenue, Platform operations and G&A costs both grew at a much slower pace than revenue. G&A's deceleration was driven partly by delayed corporate events due to COVID-19. This approach to our operating expenses continues to reflect how we actively allocate capital within the company toward areas that can drive growth and efficiency in the future and that we discussed in our Q4 2019 earnings call. Adjusted EBITDA was $39 million in Q1, up 58% year-over-year and representing a 24% margin. Income tax was a benefit of $13.7 million in the quarter mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $43.4 million or $0.90 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $53 million for Q1 and free cash flow was $33.4 million. I am going to use the remainder of the time today to walk you through what I believe are the key considerations in how we manage the company through the current environment. Everything in the near-term is about being mindful of cash management and maintaining a fair level of liquidity. This is about weathering the storm, retaining our operational flexibility with a strong cash position, and managing expenses deliberately to make sure we continue to focus on the areas we believe will drive our future growth, like CTV. We exited Q1 with a very strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $446 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. In the third-week of March, out of an abundance of caution, we pulled down our revolving line of credit. While we do not see a need to use this additional capital in the foreseeable future, we felt it was prudent to take the funds to the balance sheet to provide ample liquidity. We believe the capital on hand provides flexibility for a number of different scenarios, whether it's a slower than expected recovery or providing ready working capital to fund growth in a rapid recovery, or opportunistic M&A similar to our approach with Adbrain, the company we acquired in 2017. Our DSOs at the end of Q1 were 92 days, a decrease or improvement of three days from the same period a year ago. DPOs for Q1 were 69 days, a decrease of seven days from the same period a year ago. Given the uncertainty in this environment, at this point, we are not providing specific gross spend, revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the second quarter or full year 2020. Because of this and to be as transparent as possible, I will provide an overview of current trends on our platform that Jeff also alluded to earlier. Like other ad-funded companies, we saw a sharp deceleration in spend during the second half of March. Spend for the last week in March ended in a negative mid-teens year-over-year decline. In early April, the year-over-year decline in spend continued to increase. By mid-April, the year-over-year decline in spend stabilized. During the last 10 days in April we started to see more stabilization and then some improvement primarily driven by CTV as Jeff had described. Over that 10-day period, total spend improved to a negative high-teen's year-over-year decline. There is still a significant amount of uncertainty in this macro environment, so I caution you extrapolating this most recent data. However, we are encouraged and cautiously optimistic by the stabilization trend and improvements in late April. From an expense management perspective, we've already taken a number of actions in light of the current environment, and still have additional levers available to us should things deteriorate from today, although as Jeff said earlier we're seeing very recent signals of improvement. Some of the actions we've taken so far include reducing our 2020 hiring expectations by over 50%; pulling back on Q2 marketing costs by over 50%; pausing discretionary expenses like company events, along with the natural pausing of T&E due to the current situation; and right-sizing future facilities capital investments where we can based on updated hiring plans. We entered this crisis period in a position of strength, as our profitable business model with healthy EBITDA margins allows us the flexibility to handle reductions in top-line relatively well. Adding that to our additional liquidity, we believe sets us up to weather this storm better than most companies in our space. While lower spend in the short-term hurts, and our EBITDA will be impacted, we are well positioned, as we emerge from this to gain trust from our customers and suppliers, differentiate ourselves from peers and gain market share. If conditions were to get worse, we have levers available to us to manage cost even further. But at the same time, we believe we have the structure in place to accelerate growth and gain share when things get better, as we believe they will. By balancing those decisions, we believe that once we get through to the other side of this crisis, we will be more ready to add value to our customers by helping them reach more of their customers than we ever have before. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open it up for questions. Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. You know, I guess what I would have to say about our expense philosophy is that our guiding principle is to continue generating quality positive EBITDA over the long-term. The focus now that we want to take is to balance our expense base to stay flexible. So that staying flexible in order to be ready to grab share in our recovery or, and also be disciplined in case the recovery takes longer than we expect and we have additional levers still available to us. One data point that might be helpful is, excluding stock-based comp the actions that we've taken to-date that I referred to in the prepared remarks, they reduced our cost base by over 10% from our original actions that I refer to include reducing hiring expectations by more than 50%, reducing Q2 marketing costs by more than 50%, pausing various discretionary spend like events, some T&E and other areas. And it's important to remember we have other levers still available to us and we'll just adapt based on how the macro environment unfolds. No, I think you've covered it well. The only thing I'll add to what Jeff said is that we did \u2013 we were super diligent about where we choose to hire for the near term. So just to give you some idea, we said we reduced hiring from our full year plan by 50%, of the remaining hires that we have open right now, 75% of those are in sales and marketing, and technology and development. And those are the areas that will give us the ability to be a catalyst to continue our growth. So we're not slowing the business down, that's really important. We're really \u2013 what we're trying to do is be as flexible as possible in order to gain share in the recovery, but also be adaptable depending on where this all goes. And so that's the kind of a balanced mechanism that we're trying to do."

In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of our operations in addition to potential supply chain disruptions that could disrupt advertising spend are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we also present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Q4 2021 was another outstanding quarter for The Trade Desk and an exclamation point on a terrific year. Across the board, we exceeded all our goals for 2021 which culminated in crossing the billion dollar revenue mark, ending the year with $1.2 billion in annual revenue, an increase of 43% year-over-year. Total platform spend was almost $6.2 billion. It's only 10 years ago, May of 2011, when we received our first penny of spend, to think last year we passed $6 billion in spend. It is both astonishing and inspiring. I say that because I truly believe that we are just getting started with our innovation, our amazing team, our unrivaled customer service, and a growing roster of global partnerships, I am convinced that we will continue to outperform in an addressable advertising market that is racing toward a $1 trillion TAM. One aspect of our business in 2021 that was particularly encouraging was the pace at which we signed major customer agreements. As the year progress, we signed an increasing number of long-term commitments with some of the largest brand advertisers in the world. Last year, the Top 25 advertisers on our platform increased their spend on the platform more than 50% compared to the prior-year. And that's before some of these long-term agreements have fully activated. Momentum is also growing due to increased awareness and understanding of our value among brand marketers and their agencies. And I will just spend my time today looking back on the highlights of 2021, but also discuss the factors that are shaping 2022 into what I expect will be the most impactful year, TTD has ever had. I believe this will provide color on why brand marketers are increasingly gravitating to our platform. Looking back on 2021, one of the highlights was the launch of our biggest product ever, Solimar. As you know, we launched Solimar on 7/7, after years of investment. But as with any major platform overhaul, there's always the question of exactly what the impact will be. The answer is that Solimar has been an upgrade to our business in every way. It helps advertisers and agencies embrace completely new ways of thinking about data, measurement, goal setting and campaign optimization. And I'm pleased to report that as of today, the majority of ad impressions on our platform are now bought via Solimar. At the current pace, we expect to deprecate the legacy platform before the fourth quarter of this year. To accomplish a complete transition to the new platform within about a year is an impressive feat by anyone's standards. And it speaks to the value that advertisers are realizing with Solimar. Solimar was created to help advertisers make better data driven decisions at every step of the marketing funnel and in doing so take full advantage of the power of the Open Internet. We wanted to make setup easier and decisions more data driven. We also wanted to make certain that our AI and machine learning product branded as Koa was always on when the benefit was obvious. With a better blend of human and machine, advertisers can apply the right data automatically. And Solimar can optimize everything from predictive clearing to audience targeting to price discovery. Every ad campaign becomes more effective, every ad dollar is working as hard as it can. And as a result, the flywheel spins faster activating even more campaign dollars. Let me share some data about how the move to Solimar is going. First, co-adoption on Solimar is now over 90%, nearly 50% higher than with the legacy platform. Now nearly all of our advertisers are getting richer data driven insights and recommendations on how to reach and measure their target audiences most effectively and across the full scope of channels to optimize performance. In fact, average channel usage for Solimar campaigns has also increased about 50%. With Solimar, advertisers get a better perspective on cross channel performance and insight into how an omni channel campaign can take a consumer through an integrated advertising experience. And finally, and probably one of the most important changes. For those advertisers that have switched to Solimar, the average number of data elements applied to each impression has more than doubled. Many of the amazing results we are seeing from Solimar are due to restructuring of our data marketplace, and the courage of our data partners to try something new in the hopes of upgrading the entire Open Internet. As a result, Solimar is a bit of a twofer one, a better decisioning engine and a better data marketplace. Let me spend a moment on the improved data marketplace as it represents a significant upgrade to how the entire industry currently thinks about data and data pricing. Until now I would describe the marketplace for data in digital advertising is somewhat anemic. And that's largely because of the way that data has traditionally been priced across the web. In Walled Garden, data pricing is opaque with effectively zero price discovery. In the Open Web, historically data pricing has been more fixed than variable, which leaves little room for price discovery or even value discovery is akin to a real estate agent, charging a fixed dollar rate regardless of the value of the home that's been sold. In the case of data that has meant that each data element could be too expensive relative to the value of the impression. This also then becomes an inhibitor to advertisers who want to apply a full scope of data to every impression. But with Solimar and the new data marketplace, we have shifted our data pricing model away from fixed rates toward percentage of CPM. This would never have been possible without the support and commitment of the hundreds of data partners who participate on our platform and who were willing to make this change. This allows for much greater flexibility and data deployment based on both value and relevance. We have created a market where there's more accurate price discovery for data, which is more closely aligned to the value it creates instead of high fixed rates. Additionally, there's another major data marketplace design change that will fully roll out in the first half of '22. This change will address the major obstacle to cure the Open Internet data anemia. Currently, there is a disincentive to layer multiple data elements onto the same impression because the cost is prohibitive and price discovery has been a problem. With variable pricing now universal in our data marketplace, we can now add fractional pricing. This means we can offer for example, a basket of data options for customers that in total doesn't necessarily cost them more, but activates more data sources and pay supplier based on precise value created for the advertiser. In doing so data providers have the opportunity to make more money in aggregate. This creates incentive to use data whenever it adds value, and rewards data companies for the value they create. We expect that this will create the most robust data marketplace ever on the Open Internet. Not only will the Open Internet benefit, but we will be able to layer in more data significantly enriching each ad impression for the advertiser. In total, this increases the use of data. As we enrich each impression, advertisers on our platform become more effective and they invest more. Already our data marketplace changes have been so successful that we have seen advertiser bid win rates increase significantly, because they have been much more precise in understanding the value of each ad impression. Again, this means advertisers are inclined to spend more because they are achieving even better ROI making the flywheel spin faster. Looking back on another highlight from this last year, we blaze new trails in the rapidly emerging world of shopper marketing, another green field that is open to us because of the use of data. As of the fourth quarter, we're up and running with the Walmart DSP with select major advertisers. The initial results have been very encouraging. BIC is one of the early adopters as you probably know BIC is headquartered in France, but is a global leader in consumer products such as ballpoint pens, lighters, and grooming. And Walmart is a major retail partner for them. In December BIC ran holiday campaigns for some key products, including men's and women's razors using the new Walmart DSP. The results were even better than we hoped for. BIC achieved return on ad spend or ROAS of just under 500%. That means for every advertising dollar, they drove $5 in consumer purchases. This data is significant for a few reasons. First, with closed loop measurement, BIC is able to get a very rapid assessment of ROAS, the shopper data available in the Walmart DSP makes it much easier for brands like BIC to make the connection between campaign spend, and consumer purchase. And second ROAS of 500% is well above the industry average. According to Nielsen, a good ROAS as is around 270%. So to take an industry standard benchmark and almost double it is pretty staggering. Matt De Paolo is BIC Senior Manager of omnichannel growth, and he recently spoke about the power of the Walmart DSP. To quote him directly, he said, I don't want to overstate it. But this is something the industry has been waiting for, for a very long time. And now we finally have at our disposal, we had suspected that The Trade Desk would be a powerful complement to Walmart's capabilities, and this validated our suspicions. This represents the sentiment of many advertisers. They want retail data to help them improve and their ad spend in digital. They want to better understand how media moves people through the purchase journey. I firmly believe that 2022 will be the year that advertisers start to realize the power of shopper marketing. Walmart is leading the charge here. Amy Lanzi is the Commerce Practice Lead at Publicis for North America. She recently spoke with The Current, our online news site about how the Walmart DSP is capturing the attention of CMOs, who previously weren't as hands on with the retailers. To quote her directly, she said it used to be that you would negotiate how you've got a better display in a physical store now is a dynamic conversation that includes their digital shelves, and how brands can reach Walmart shoppers who are outside the retailers ecosystem. In the coming quarters, I'll have more to say about how we're partnering with other retailers in innovative ways to unlock the power of shopper marketing data for advertisers. As I mentioned, this is just one of the areas where brand marketing leaders are gaining a greater appreciation of the value of programmatic. When looking back on the amazing success and land grab year that was 2021, it is impossible to not spend some time talking about the rise of CTV. In 2021, CTV was once again the largest driver of spend on our platform. Last year, more than 15,000 advertisers spent on CTV on our platform, and we saw the number of advertisers that spent over $1 million in CTV, almost double compared to 2020. And I highlight, CTV again, because it is such an important driver of the brand shift to programmatic more broadly. For most brands TV is the largest element of their advertising campaigns. The TV team is often the power center of our brand marketing department as TV digitizes, thanks to the massive consumer shift to streaming, advertisers are embracing the power of programmatic in their most significant channel. Once TV advertisers realize its potential to focus rapidly shifts to the value of programmatic in an omnichannel context. And this is what I mean when I said in the past, that CTV is probably the most important driver of change across digital advertising. Of course, it is not just the consumer shift that's driving advertisers to embrace CTV. TV content companies are also evolving their models at warp speed, and we continue to partner with all of the major CTV providers worldwide. Each year, the inventory avails on our platform continue to rapidly increase. And as we enter this year's upfront season, I expect we'll continue to see large TV companies further prioritize CTV as a part of that process. Indeed, The Trade Desk has already been invited to participate in some of the digital upfront program this year. And while we've talked a lot in recent quarters about partnerships with major TV content companies in North America and Europe, the same dynamic is happening now in Asia, where viewers are also rapidly shifting to CTV, or OTT. For example, we recently launched with GYAO!, one of the fastest growing streaming platforms in Japan. Regardless of location, major brand advertisers increasingly realized the vital role that CTV plays in reaching audiences that have left or were never present on linear TV. We recently ran a campaign for one of Europe's top carmakers Renault in Spain, working with our agency, Omnicom. That campaign focused on a launch of a new SUV in Spain and Renault wanted to reach as many potentially interested car buyers as possible. With CTV, Renault achieved a significant double-digit incremental reach over linear, we're seeing the same phenomenon with brand advertisers around the world. They're embracing CTV as an essential element of their massive TV ad campaigns. And because of the outsized effect that TV has on most marketing departments, this growing adoption spins the flywheel faster for us across all advertising channels. Now switching gears a bit, I'd like to talk about the future and why 2022 is set up to be our biggest year ever, not just in financial performance, but also in strategic leadership, and increasing our market share. Yesterday, we announced another very big initiative, OpenPath. This is the biggest direct step we've made yet to improve the supply chain for our clients, us and the Open Internet. Let me take a moment to explain what this is, OpenPath is a product that enables content owners from TV and across the web to plug in to CTV directly. OpenPath is a direct pipeline to publisher inventory for any publisher that chooses to integrate directly with us. An inefficient supply chain is bad for advertisers and for publishers. We're very pleased to launch OpenPath with some of the largest journalistic publishers in the world, including The Washington Post, Conde Nast, Reuters, the Tribune, and USA Today. OpenPath is especially helpful for larger publishers and content owners that want to do their own yield management. We're not competing with SSPs or becoming an ad network, we represent the advertisers in the auction. Our goal in creating this product is to provide a high bid directly to publishers and content owners who want to do their own yield management. One of our core operating principles since our inception is the pursuit of a level playing field for digital advertising with transparency on all sides. We believe that's the best way to build trust in digital advertising, which will drive overall market growth and we also believe that on a level playing field, everyone gets to compete fairly on the value they provide. As a demand side platform, we're confident that on a level playing field, we will continue to outperform and gain more market share of the growing TAM. With this product launch, we also announced that we are no longer buying from Google so called Open Bidding or OB product. You may recall that Open Bidding is one of the main focus areas of recent antitrust lawsuits against Google, including the one from the Texas State Attorney General's Office. With this and as part of our ongoing supply chain optimization initiatives, we will continue to prune supply paths that are opaque, unfair or inefficient. That said, we plan to continue to buy on Google's Ad Exchange. Where all the SFPs that provide yield optimization for publishers, we expect that this product and policy change will result in more spend to them. You might be interested as to why we started with journalism in terms of our initial partners. Journalism has more stake than perhaps any other market segment here. Journalism relies on advertising. And the ad model for newspapers of 30 years ago has evolved into something very different today. It's vital that we preserve the value exchange of advertising for journalism content, because journalism is such an important factor in the free flow of trusted information in any functioning society. But OpenPath will scale to any publisher that wants a direct path to our demand. Let me just reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSP or the supply side business. This is not about that at all. We won't be getting into yield management or any of the various value propositions that a number of the great SSPs provide. Open path is simply a direct path in the inventory. This is something that our advertising clients have been asking us for a long time. And they become more aware of the supply side inefficiencies over the past few months. The impact will be positive for SSPs that have invested in their publisher relationships and are offering value in terms of yield management from companies such as Magnite, Pubmatic and Index Exchange. As with any maturing market, as it becomes more efficient, the companies that succeed will be the ones that provide clear value and differentiate themselves to customers.  As I said, we are launching OpenPath in partnership with some of the world\u2019s leading journalistic outlets. They have been incredibly enthusiastic about this initiative. Hopefully you saw some of the press coverage yesterday, but just to quote a couple of them. Conde Nast said, we are pleased to be working with The Trade Desk on OpenPath to enable deeper conversations with our clients about inventory transparency and performance. The Washington Post said, we have long believed that a more streamlined supply chain benefits both advertisers and publishers. And McClatchy said OpenPath aligns with our objective to build a transparent, well-lit digital ad environment, driven by journalism that strengthens the communities we serve. Those are just a few, but I could not be more excited about the early momentum for OpenPath. Of course, another area I'm especially excited about for 2022 is the progress the industry is making with UID2. More major publishers around the world are committing to UID2, and more advertisers are transacting on UID2 on our platform. KG Media, Indonesia's biggest media network, is the latest publisher in Asia to announce its support of UID2. KG boasts an extensive portfolio of publishing properties including newspapers, TV networks, and retail. They believe that UID2 is not just a replacement but a significant upgrade to cookies as a common currency of the open internet, creating a better experience for both consumers and advertisers. That was certainly the experience for CoCoVillage, a manufacturer and retailer of high-end children\u2019s toys and furniture, servicing the North American market. They wanted to secure an easy way to leverage their valuable first party CRM data to find new audiences for their products. Working with UID2 they were able to model new potential customer groups, drive incremental reach of almost 40%, and a return-on-ad-spend of more than a 1000%. Additionally, we believe many of the same publishers that are signing up for OpenPath will also sign up for UID2. We expect that these two products, which both improve the Open Internet, and will help to increase the adoption of the other. In addition to publishers and advertisers who are adopting UID2, important industry trade groups are also weighing in with their support. Perhaps one of the most important groups is the MMA, because they represent the voice of the brand marketer, and their board comprises many of the world\u2019s leading CMOs. I was invited to join their board last year, precisely because brand marketers want to be fully engaged in new approaches to identity and measurement. The MMA views UID2 as a solution that can solve for the identity needs of the open internet. To quote their CEO, Greg Stuart, directly: \"identity is the key to the future of marketing, and especially important to marketers in taking full advantage of the larger reach and need for transparency to consumer consent that the open web affords. UID2 has a great potential to be a solution that the whole industry can work on collectively to craft a compliant and effective identity solution for everyone. To finish, let me just summarize why I\u2019m so bullish about 2022 and our future. More than ever, the biggest brands in the world appreciate the value of data driven advertising, and increasingly they are embracing our platform. I\u2019ve spent time today talking about some of the more compelling recent drivers of that growing interest. And over the years, we have built trust with those advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver premium value to their campaigns. This business model is key in generating alpha in revenue and market share growth. We continue to have a customer retention rate over 95%. Our engineering teams continue to lead the industry in innovation, charting new value opportunities for our advertisers. As a result, we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Our profitability and positive cash generation allow us to make the long-term investments that will ensure we can continue to provide that premium value that includes Solimar, which is creating new value for advertisers by unleashing data and driving a greater return-on-ad-spend, spinning the flywheel for advertisers\u2019 campaigns. It\u2019s driving our leadership in CTV, the fastest-growing channel in digital advertising, and a driver of new thinking across the marketing spectrum. It positions us to make the supply chain that is more efficient for our advertisers and agencies in 2022, with initiatives like OpenPath. It enables us to do pioneer work in shopper marketing, a $100 billion market. You\u2019ll see us forge partnerships with major retailers worldwide, including Walgreens. Just yesterday, they announced that advertisers will be able to leverage new audience data services on our platform, based on anonymized Walgreens' shopper data. It has allowed us to become a leader in political advertising. 2022 will be an important midterm election year in the United States. We have spent years building an objective and independent platform, open to registered candidates on all sides, that can help drive discussions of substance in the political arena. In 2022 we will make meaningful progress with partners and industry bodies to make measurement better, especially for CTV and all digital spend outside of the U.S. Profitability and free cash flow will also allow us to invest for global growth. Roughly two-thirds of global advertising spend is outside the U.S. This is a major focus for us. Once again, we saw strong growth in our international markets in the fourth quarter, driven by CTV. In fact, our CTV share of spend more than doubled in Europe in the quarter. And we continue to open promising new markets, such as Taiwan, India, Italy and the Nordics, with impressive leaders who are making very rapid inroads. We are a global company and we expect our international revenue to outpace North America over the long-term because of the investments we\u2019re making in these markets. We are very well positioned for 2022 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we\u2019ve discussed today. And what I\u2019m most excited about is the shift we\u2019re seeing among more and more senior brand marketers. In a variety of dimensions, marketers are becoming more familiar and enthusiastic about programmatic advertising. Whether it\u2019s the performance value of Solimar, the holy grail of retail data, the CTV revolution, or new supply path models, they understand the power of data-driven advertising to help them differentiate and drive growth in their businesses. And that\u2019s the most rewarding thing of all. I could not be more excited about the opportunity in front of us and our growth prospects into 2022 and beyond. And with that, I\u2019ll pass the baton to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you Jeff, and good morning everyone. We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, capping off a great year for our business. Q4 revenue was $396 million, a 24% increase from a year ago. Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections which represented a high-single digit percentage share of our business in Q4 of 2020, revenue increased approximately 36% year-over-year. That represented a slight acceleration from the prior year which is impressive considering we experienced a strong recovery at the end of 2020. For 2021, we ended the year with almost $6.2 billion in spend on our platform and nearly $1.2 billion in revenue, representing 43% year-over-year revenue growth. We also ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of just over $500 million and generated nearly $320 million in free cash flow in 2021. We are enthusiastic that the combination of our business strategy -- of being the default DSP for the open internet where we only represent the buy-side and avoid conflicts too often prevalent in our industry by those who own inventory, along with a proven business model that generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, is producing solid and consistent growth, as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market of around $1 trillion. We have been encouraged to see advertisers accelerate their shift to data-driven advertising in 2021. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the value that The Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they work to connect with their customers across our platform every day. For both the quarter and the full-year, Connected TV continued to be our fastest growing channel at scale around the world. As Jeff mentioned, Solimar is now over 50% adoption and we are seeing promising results as customers, on average, are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously. In Q4, our partnership with Walmart officially kicked off, UID2 had significant momentum and as we have consistently stated, we have seen no material impact on our business from the iOS platform changes in 2021. In addition to the strong top-line performance in Q4, we generated $192 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 48% of revenue. When we outperform on the top-line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, which it did again in Q4. EBITDA continued to benefit from temporarily lower than expected operating expense growth partly driven by the continued virtual environment that we are still predominantly operating in. Even recognizing that, we are extremely proud of our continued ability to substantially grow our top-line revenue while also producing meaningfully positive EBITDA. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. For Q4, Video, which includes CTV and mobile each represented the largest percent share of spend. Display, which also grew very nicely in Q4, and audio ended the year representing about 15% and 5% of our business, respectively. Geographically, North America represented 86% and International represented 14% of our business for the quarter. Shanghai and Hong Kong drove spend growth in Northern APAC and Australia and Singapore led our growth in Southern APAC. In terms of EMEA, our London and Paris offices led the way. CTV growth across EMEA was again quite strong in Q4, and still represents a fraction of the share of spend we see in North America. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them exhibited healthy growth during the quarter. Shopping, which includes ecommerce, Hobbies & Interest, and business were the strongest performers in Q4. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. The Law & Politics vertical decelerated materially year-over-year in Q4, as expected, due to the comparison against the 2020 U.S. election cycle. Operating expenses were $421 million in Q4, up 97% from a year ago. As expected, the growth in operating expenses during the quarter was driven primarily by stock-based compensation, specifically $158 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a long-term CEO performance award that was recorded in G&A expense. The $158 million expense included a tranche of the grant that accelerated based on stock price achievement and relative benchmark performance thresholds during Q4. In Q4, excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $216 million, up 23% year-over-year. For the full year, we gained significant operating leverage in both our platform operations and G&A areas as we scaled the business and improved our efficiency. Income tax was a benefit of $35 million in the quarter mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $208 million or $0.42 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $163 million and free cash flow was $151 million in Q4. The strong cash generation during the quarter was driven predominantly by our operating results. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis. DSOs exiting Q4 were 107 days, down 14 days from a year ago. DPOs were 91 days, down 10 days from a year ago. We exited Q4 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $959 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning now to our outlook. The year has started out strong and we estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $303 million which would represent growth of 38% on a year-over-year basis which is a slight acceleration over the prior year. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $91 million in Q1. Turning now to expenses. In 2022, we anticipate our stock-based compensation to rise from our normal run-rate. This is being driven by approximately $265 million of stock-based compensation expense we expect to include in 2022 related to the long-term CEO performance award. At the end of 2021, the performance award had $661 million in unrecognized stock-based compensation, which is expected to be included in our G&A expense over approximately four years but could be accelerated if the threshold criteria is met earlier than expected. The total amount expensed is unrelated to whether any of the performance award thresholds are ever met. Only shares that have met the threshold criteria outlined in the performance plan are factored into our total shares outstanding. Excluding the performance grant, for 2022, we expect total operating expense growth to increase on a year-over-year basis. Considering our ability to generate strong EBITDA and cash flow, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business with a massive available market in front of us that can generate long term growth, such as the generational shift to connected TV, the expanding retail data opportunity and the expectation that our international operations will grow faster than North America over the long-term. To help take advantage of those opportunities, we expect to increase our rate of hiring over pandemic affected periods and will do so in a competitive hiring market. We also expect that return-to-work expenses will begin to revert to pre-pandemic levels, including live events, travel and other related activities. Understanding all of that, we do expect the operating expense structure of the company to be better than it was prior to the pandemic, and over the long term expect Sales & Marketing and Technology & Development areas to represent a larger share of our investment. We are proud of the fact that we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that can consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We expect 2022 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be at least $75 million. We expect data center and infrastructure spend to drive the majority of the growth year-over-year and represent a larger share of our expenditures relative to office facilities compared to the prior year. And finally, with regards to tax -- absent any changes to U.S. tax laws, we expect our full-year 2022 tax rate to be about 25%. This is obviously impacted by any tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. In closing, we are pleased with the momentum of our business and the strong start to the year. We are highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. With large growth drivers such as CTV, our international business, our retail data opportunity that just kicked off in Q4 with the Walmart DSP, the 2022 mid-term elections in the US, and our recent platform upgrade in Solimar, I believe we have significant opportunities to grow our business. In addition, we are in a position to drive not only long-term growth but also to scale our business efficiently and continue to improve in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions\nOperator: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from Shyam Patil from Susquehanna. Your line is live.\nShyam Patil: Hey guys, congrats on the fourth quarter results and the strong outlook. I've got one question, Jeff. There's some news out this morning. I was hoping you comment on, just curious for your initial thoughts on the Android News. And just what kind of impact you see for The Trade Desk and the industry? Thank you.\nJeff Green: You bet. Well, first of all, thanks, Shyam for the kind words, I'm incredibly proud of the team. I'm proud of what we accomplished in 2021 and especially just an amazingly strong finish in Q4. And then I'm just equally encouraged by the momentum so far this year. So I just want to really underline that, because I do think that there's a lot of discussion, including much of my morning was just reading about Google's announcement. And I will just say, I'm incredibly encouraged by the way this is rolling out. So first, I don't believe that this will have a negative impact on our business. And I think it has a good chance of having a positive impact on our business. And so in order to understand that though, of course, you just have to acknowledge that Google is getting hit from all sides as it relates to antitrust scrutiny, as well as privacy scrutiny. So this move by Google is not a surprise, it's not like Android could just sit around and be the only platform not to pull back on implicit data sharing. But they created an amazing transition period, which I think is very good for the industry. And something that just they've learned from, I would say Apple's mistake on this. And the rhetoric is really focused on improving the Internet. And a lot of things that they're saying now are different than things that they've said in the past. So from our perspective, we say bring on the explicit opt in future. When the UID is present, and we get an opt in, great. And when we don't, we'll do modeling, and we're going to be fine, no matter what. I'll also just note that Google has recently of course, tested FLoC and topics, and neither have gone very well. And they haven't been very received very well in the antitrust discussions in particular, but also in especially FLoC's case, in the privacy discussions. So I'm really encouraged by Google pressing the point that they are committed to treating themselves equally as for their agreements with regulators. In other words, foundationally, Google needs targeted advertising. And as a result, that makes them a good partner of ours in this fight to just get things right between that balance of the quid pro quo of the Internet. As it relates to mobile specifically, mobile device IDs are of course, relevant to in app advertising. But that isn't all of mobile. So just important note there. And then, Facebook and others have to monetize every impression and most of those impressions are mobile, but we look at all the ad opportunities and choose the ones that are best. So I always use an example, it's not uncommon for a Fortune 500 company to be looking at $10 million to PSVR platform, and then they select the 1,250 that are the best for them. If that denominator changes a little bit, if it moves from $11 million to $10 million, then they just choose a different set of impressions. But I've used that before. In this case, that isn't actually the right way to think about this one, we're actually still getting the $11 million QPS, they're just slightly less appealing, because of perhaps less metadata. So we're still going to get to choose and it doesn't really change our value proposition at all, it does perhaps shift some dollars to impression that just have more metadata, most notably into CTV. But if I'm Google, and I just want to encourage everybody to think about this for a second, and I have to respond to all of these pressures from all these different areas. I actually want to see things like UID 2 succeed but I'm under way too much scrutiny to endorse it or especially to propose it myself, but I want to see it succeed. So in other words, I can't carry the ball, but I can block. To me what they did today is they are blocking. This is an amazing setup for UID 2, and it makes CTV advertising even more appealing. Everything at CTV has a login. And that login is controlled by the content owners. And those content owners none of them have a monopoly and none of them own a sizable OHS. So the login makes personalization up to the content owners. Lastly, related to this, Apple is doing more and more non-ad personalization using their Apple ID. I think this is indicative of the future. It's an opt-in future with clear consent to provide personalization perpetuating the very amazing quid pro quo of the Open Internet and to me that sounds a lot like what we've been after from the very beginning. So, like we said, bring on the explicit opt-in future.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research. Your line is live.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you very much. Jeff, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on shopper marketing. So can you give us more details about how Walmart launch went in Q4, and the way your relationship with Walmart is going this year and maybe in the future, and also Walgreens announcement yesterday, how different is that from what you're doing with Walmart? And are you talking to other retailers and if you are, what kind of pushback or gating factors are you seeing there?\nJeff Green: You bet, thanks Vasily. So first, Walmart has been a fantastic partner. We're working very closely to just pioneer new thinking about retailer and brand relationships, and of course, shopper marketing and retail data. As you know, we launched in Q4, it was really a test phase, where we had roughly 20 large brands that were running on a Walmart DSP, of course powered on our platform. We are continuing to just partner with more and more retailers. Most notably, we just announced yesterday, our partnership with Walgreens, where they are launching their own self service and cleanroom solutions on our platform. So I want to emphasize the shopper marketing TAM is at least $100 billion. A lot of discussion about antitrust these days and I don't think there's much antitrust reasoning to be in retail because of how fragmented and how many opportunities there are in that space. Of course, we're talking to many of them. And it's just a reminder, of really what closing the loop, the value of that sort of Holy Grail of retail data is about closing the loop.  So we read a lot about just measurement being affected in Facebook's earnings. But that is very different in a world where you have data on at the time of conversion. And so to me, like, all the landscape changes that have happened in the last few months are just actually pointing to the need for these retail partnerships, as well as the strategies that we're seeing deployed by many of the biggest retailers in the world. So we're very encouraged by it, we expect more partnerships to come. And we expect retail and shopper marketing to continue to grow, '22 is going to be an amazing year for that growing up.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Justin Patterson from KeyBanc. Your line is live.\nJustin Patterson: Great, thank you very much. Jeff, could you please expand on why OpenPath isn't a threat to the SSPs as well as just the significance in dropping Google's Open Bidding and then for Trade Desk specifically, how should we think about the potential benefit to spend in unit economics on the platform from this type of initiative, particularly as it starts to pair up with Unified ID 2, thank you so much.\nJeff Green: You bet. So let me first start by explaining that what Open Bidding is and then I'll talk about what OpenPath is because there's two separate strategic moves that were made on the same day. So earlier this week, we announced that we were doing these two things, the first of which was that we were no longer going to bid or participate in Open Bidding, or Google's alternative to header bidding. Many of you who've been involved with us for a while, remember that the advent of header bidding was one of the best things that ever happened to us as a company. And one of the best things that happened to the Open Internet. What header bidding did is it made the market more competitive and it took the publisher decisioning, of which ad to show away from Google and put it into this open source header technology. It's called header bidding, because it's code that just gets placed in the header tag of a webpage. But Google created OB as a response to it. And it definitely had a positive effect for Google. But we don't believe that it created a level playing field certainly favored some part over others. If you read that Texas Attorney General's complaint, and you read about Jedi Blue and some of the allegations there, those are all related to Open Bidding. So naturally, we wanted to turn that off knowing that nearly every publisher in there has another path to that inventory. So we don't lose out on any of the inventory, we just bias towards paths that are a little bit more transparent, and more fair, which we think is good for our advertisers and good for everybody else. So the only people that it's not good for those that were benefiting unfairly or wouldn't compete and wouldn't be able to compete in a fair marketplace. So, as a result, we also decided to launch OpenPath, which basically gives publishers the ability to integrate with us directly. Now I just want to be emphatically clear here. This is not us getting into the SSP business, at the core of SSP is providing yield management, trying to give publishers the highest yield possible. And they typically are trying to manage a large chunk of their inventory. Instead, what we're doing is we're enabling them to integrate with us directly. So in the cases where we want to bid, they will get that bid directly to them. And then they can compare that to their other sources of demand, so that they can do their own yield management, we expect this will often be the case with very large publishers. And we think this will have a very positive effect on the state of the supply chain, in both CTV and especially in journalism. We wanted to start with journalism, because that was the one most affected by header bidding for the positive and in some ways, most negatively affected by all the changes that have happened in the supply chain and the fight that's happening over identity. Meanwhile, there's all of these journalistic outlets that are trying to monetize as optimally as possible. And with all these feuds over identity, including many of which that are dependent on mobile apps, they need high CPM to just stay in business. So we're so excited that what this represents at launch is 70% of the newspaper readership in the United States, between Reuters, Washington Post's, USA Today, Hearst, Conde Nast, Tribune, and just many, many others. We think this represents just a huge lifeline to the journalistic community. I do want to just underline one more time, there is nothing more important to us than preserving our objectivity. That means that we're in this for the buyer, we're representing advertisers and agencies in the decisions that we make that will continue. We're just willing to transmit that bid directly to the content owner when it's possible, and when they want that. And as a result, we think that creates a more effective supply chain, and gives more momentum to the Open Internet that is largely being fueled by Connected TV.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Your line is live.\nTim Nollen: Thanks very much. I'd like to turn back to the CTV topic, if I could, Jeff. You mentioned the upfront markets coming up and your role in the digital upfront, wonder if you could talk a bit more about maybe the upfront in general, I think it's not just digital and sort of what you're doing with the network groups and the agencies in that process. Relatedly, could you address the availability of ad impressions in CTV, which I guess fluctuated over the years from being in short supply to being more plentiful? Maybe what is the current state overall, and within all of these OTT services that you're servicing? And then lastly, if I could just talk one in relatedly, as well, you mentioned measurement for CTV, any more color you could give us on your efforts in helping measure CTV more effectively would be great. Thanks.\nJeff Green: You bet, so first I'll just say I've never been more bullish on CTV than we are right now. And that's in large part because of all of our partnerships with the content owners. And again, just as we've integrated it with them directly more and more as time has gone on. And as we've seen them grow as we've seen them test AVOD, SVOD and hybrid models, we're seeing more and more of move towards AVOD. And that that speaks to your, I think the third part of your question, which is about what's happening to inventory. It started out that most of us that are consuming and I'm speaking as a consumer per minute, most of us did our consumption on Amazon and Netflix SVOD offerings. And then over time, we were introduced to things like Hulu and now so many others that are AVOD or hybrid, like in Hulu's case. And as we've learned from so many of them, it's often a better way for them to monetize, to be an AVOD company. And it also is what the consumer typically prefers as in Hulu's case, 80% of consumers prefer the ads. Now, some of that has been a phenomenon for many years. But that predates what I'll describe as what is now peaking, which is subscription fatigue. So that was true at Hulu many years ago, it's still it's even more true today because of course, there's more subscriptions, it takes more work to figure out where to watch, what you want to watch for the average American household to be paying for 15 subscriptions, instead of two or three that they were a few years ago, the cost is prohibitive. So in AVOD and now all of those companies are graded on subscribers, how many subscribers do they get, and just some pretty impressive numbers across the board. And just from many of them as we watched, how they recorded on their last year. But in order for them to keep those subscribers, they have to make it affordable. So we expect to see more and more of them adopting advertising, they need that to be relevant, so that they show a fewer ads that are more relevant to the user, so that they keep an amazing experience for the consumer. But then the consumer can also afford it. So I believe strongly. Excuse me, that's the most promising part of our future is in CTV because of those market dynamics. Now, the last part of your question about upfront. Basically, for those of you that are unaware of upfront process, what used to happen is everybody would come together at certain seasons of the year to buy all the ads on an upfront basis. And you would try to bet on the shows that you thought were going to be successful. And the model was really built before there was anything digital and when there weren't that many content companies. But nevertheless, there is still this desire to go to an event or an upfront schedule, and get some sense of plan for the rest of the year and get some sense of inventory and to make commitments, where sometimes big advertisers can use their size to get a better deal, if you will. And then publishers are willing to trade that better deal for assurances that they're going to get spent. But what's increasingly brought into the equation is the need for audience and data. And that's not really conducive to just signing an insertion order or contract that sells all the inventory to one company, you need to put your audience data to work, you need real time decisioning, you don't really know who's going to be watching, what the characteristics are. And so as a result, more and more of those upfront discussions are bringing us into the middle between those two entities, so that we can enable better decisioning and higher CPMs for the publisher, and of course, better decisions for the advertisers. So we're very encouraged by the invitation to the upfronts by the type of deals that are being struck, and by how often audience and full data decisioning is now being brought into upfront discussions, which we believe are going to transform the upfronts in years, over the next few years. But that's all good news for us. That's good news for decisioning. That's good news for CPM. That's good news for the TV landscape, which is getting more and more competitive and gravitating more and more towards AVOD.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is live.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you very much, Jeff, congrats on the consistent performance. Two questions, please, for Unified ID 2.0, you're clearly getting a lot of adoption within agencies, within streaming media networks, et cetera. Can you maybe speak to adoption within the large advertiser base, maybe anything to share in terms of adoption within the Top 100, can you give maybe examples of how they're actually using it and on Solimar, thanks for the some of the metrics you shared, but can you maybe share some additional color on any learnings from the upgrade in terms of the customer experience, and maybe the lift in spend relative to either the previous platform you had or even relative to your expectations? Thanks.\nJeff Green: You bet. So first of all, thanks for the question. Excited to talk on both of these topics. So first, I was prepared to answer a question like this by saying something like, as I look back on last year, I don't think the momentum could have been any better. But now that I look at today's announcements from Google, I expect this to help our momentum. So when I say momentum couldn't have been any better. Given all the macro environment, it couldn't have been any better than but it's going to be even better now. So, our January avails with UID's presence reached an all time high in January, we continue to grow rapidly outside the United States. And we're just partnering all over the place with those that create infrastructure for the Internet. So many people don't, I think properly understand or value, the partnerships that we have, when we partner with companies like LiveRamp or a Snowflake that are providing infrastructure for the Internet. Many of the largest advertisers on our platform are now transacting a UID, or in the process of implementing Solimar does make that much, much easier to implement and OpenPath will have a huge impact on just accelerating UID as well, because as we integrate directly with many of the publishers, of course, the SDK will include both capabilities and some amount of encouragement that to of course implement UID so that we can provide more data driven advertising that provides higher CPMs. We're seeing significant increases around the world, maybe most notably in APAC, but the numbers are just very impressive. At this point, we're on over billions of devices. So with the footprint that we have today, we're incredibly encouraged. And then with these sort of other external pressures on other players, and the discussion on privacy and antitrust, those are actually creating secular tailwinds for UID 2.0, as it relates to Solimar, amazing attraction as well, I had hoped that we would have the majority of our impressions on it by this quarter, or at least by the end of this quarter. We did it last quarter, so now over 50% of impressions are bought on Solimar. We expect over 100% by the end of the year. And I think that could even come sooner if things go really well. But we are looking at 100% of impressions bought on our new product are on Solimar before the end of this year. So pretty amazing transition, given we just launched that on 7/7. But that's great. And it makes it so that we have a better user experience. And we think that we have more stickiness because that experience is also just much easier for people to use and make decisions. But it also is driving more data usage where that's the number of data elements applied to each impressions more than doubled. There's more usage of Koa, which is our AI and ML where adoptions now over 90%, average number of channels has increased by 50%. So channels being things like mobile, display, CTV, video, audio, so when you see that increased by 50%, what you're seeing is people being holistic in the way that they're buying, and for the first time ever we're doing I think unprecedented work and comparing apples to oranges in the media landscape. And then just seeing a massive increase in first-party data usage. And that has encouraged as well as enabled by UID as well. So I expect Solimar to have a positive impact on UID, which was already going incredibly well. I expect OpenPath to have a positive impact and I expect Google's recent announcements also have a positive impact on UID 2.0. So really, both of those things are some of the brightest spots of our 2022 ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Laura Martin from Needham. Your line is live.\nLaura Martin: Good morning. Can you hear me okay, Jeff?\nJeff Green: We can, how are you, Laura?\nLaura Martin: Hi, I'm great, Jeff. Thanks. So the question I've gotten more frequently this morning after you guys reported earnings for CTV. So you said a couple of times that CTV is growing faster and driving your growth, so the question then becomes, you grew your total year revenue at 42%. But the fourth quarter 24%, does that mean that CTV growth essentially had and any kind of metrics you can give us and how big is CTV today as a percent of your total revenue. Any kind of clarity you can give us about CTV size and momentum and whether it's flowing, love that, second business model housekeeping item, very excited about the data marketplace, you talked about a lot today. My question is, do you have a rev share like Android does the data that's bought on your platform or you just getting more spend on your platform? And that's how you're making more money from implementing that data marketplace? Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Green: You bet. And I'll take first crack at the both questions and then if Chris or Blake want to add anything on the numbers, we don't break out any of our channels specifically as a total, I will say that CTV is definitely growing faster than the rest of our business. And I do believe CTV growth is leading the way, there's some unique things about comps and whatnot that I think they can talk about, but I don't think that's indicative of the growth of our business or the growth of CTV. So I'm not certain that that comparison gives you any insight into the business or CTV specifically. As it relates to the business model on our data marketplace, we do make money on the data that gets purchased. So it's not just about creating spend in media, we make money on all forms of spend meaning whether they buy media or whether they buy data. So we are incentivized to get data to be used more often. But of course, what we do is create models so that we never use the data and left, it is mathematically obvious to create benefit for the advertiser. And so what that has enabled is us to constantly be doing work to make certain that we're adding more value than we're extracting. That's actually one of the reasons why I'm so bullish about the changes that we've made to the data marketplace is there, we are creating way more value for the advertiser. Now on unit economics, we don't expect that to change. So in other words, I don't expect our take rate to meaningfully change in either direction, positive or negative as a result of this, but I do expect the flywheel to spin faster. We do make money on data however. So we're encouraged to either put it towards working media or put it toward data, but we better earn our keep, which is exactly what our clients want from us. The fact that we're using more data just means that we're using that data in an intelligent way to make certain that the incremental usage is worth it to the advertiser. The fact that's working across the board, I think is actually separating that from the path with everybody else, in part because we have that objectivity and alignment with the advertisers.\nBlake Grayson: And then Laura, I will just move on really quickly on top of Jeff, I think when you think about this, from a comparison perspective, the Q4 results of the 24% revenue growth, they're comparing against our hardest comp from last year because of the U.S. Election, which was a high single digit share of our spend. So when you exclude that Election spend, Q4 actually accelerated year-on-year from 34%, up to 36% in Q4 '21. So really encouraged by that because Q4 of 2020 also besides the Election comp, we had a kind of a pretty big flash recovery that came out in Q4. So we're pretty excited about that. And then with regards to the kind of wait for the next video, including CTV in mobile, each represent around 40% share of the business and then display and audio represent about 15% and 5% each, so that should give you some idea of that mix going to work.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Laura.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom White from D.A. Davidson. Your line is live.\nTom White: Great, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice results. Just on the OpenPath announcement, can you just elaborate, maybe a bit more on the future of that strategy? For example, does it you see it going beyond just the web and maybe into other channels like mobile or CTV, and then maybe for Blake, maybe comment on the impact to your financial from the strategy over time, just curious about how we should think about maybe savings on infrastructure costs, and maybe possible revenue capture from the publishers that participate? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yes, so as it relates to OpenPath, we definitely see this as extensible into CTV, which we've already indicated will happen, but also potentially into mobile. So I think increasingly, publishers are interested in cleaning up the supply path. Increasingly, advertisers are interested in cleaning up the supply path. And we've always looked at it as we have to earn our keep, and everybody in the supply path does. And we just want to make it so that the market can be as efficient as possible because the Open Internet in order to compete with the Walled Garden strategy has to be operating efficiently. That requires a bit more moving parts. But that's a better global economy. That's a better ecosystem, that's a better internet for the world. And in order for us to enable that, we think we have to continue to enable direct integration when content owners and publishers want to do their own yield management. I think it's really important that you highlighted CTV because nowhere is a more true that content owners want to do their own yield management than in CTV. But I do want to underline that we are not trying to become an SSP. We are not getting into yield management, that is a job of an SSP, or in the case for content owners want to do it themselves. It's of course their job. But that's something that we believe in order to protect our objectivity, we should stay out of which we expect to do as far as we can see in the future.\nBlake Grayson: And just to follow on and even try to be more clear. We expect no material impact to P&L or take rate from this like just said, like, there's opportunities to spin the flywheel that we're excited about. And in the support of the open Internet. We don't have any incentive to steer purchases, and we're not doing yield management. It's -- we continue to represent the buy side in what we do. And so no material impact on the P&L side.\nTom White: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is live.\nBrent Thill: Jeff, everyone would love to hear your perspective on the international opportunity. I know you've put a lot of investment in time in trying to crack the code there. What's your view there? And for Blake, can you maybe just talk about the magnitude of Q4 upside was a little bit lower than we've seen? Was there anything on supply chain or advertisers pulling a little bit at the end of the quarter? Given the COVID overhang or any thoughts you have on that side? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Thank you. Yes, I'm very excited about the international prospects. So I'm always -- I start macro, which is, we're a few years away from being at that trillion dollar Tam, and roughly 60% plus to that is outside of the United States or outside of North America. So, of course, we want to capture that opportunity. And because we work with the biggest brands in the world, who advertise all over the world, they don't want 200 DSPs as partners, they would like one, to take them all over the world and especially to use their learnings in any market to benefit all the other markets. And so, as of course, our focus has been on expanding CTV all over the world. CTV more than doubled across APAC, CTV and EMEA grew by more than Forex in 2021. Shanghai and Hong Kong have been driving our growth in Northern Asia Pacific. And just some amazing partnerships across APAC with Samsung Smart TV devices now reaching over 50 million viewers and that's having access there. Xiaomi in India or Disney+ Hotstar in India. Again, China was our fastest growing office again, which when the numbers are small, that's less significant, but when you do it over and over again, it continues to be it especially significant, especially when you look at China and just say that's the second largest media market in the world, it's roughly half the size of the U.S., but it's growing at twice the pace. So with that being true. We think that represents a tremendous opportunity. And we're in a unique position to many others who are looking at that market in that we are representing the largest brands in the world who wants to spend in China. So unlike many other non-China based companies, who've been hurt by trying to go into market in China, we come to the market, mostly with a focus spend in market. And then to do expansion where Chinese brands and products will reach all over the rest of the world, which of course, they want more distribution. So I'm very encouraged by the fact that, that we've seen all this growth in those in those areas. But I can't underscore enough how important it is for us to continue to lead in CTV, we believe we've done that in the U.S. And we've proved that in the U.S. and Australia, arguably years ago in 2020. In 2021, I think we started to show amazing green shoots across other markets in EMEA, most notably in the U.K. and Germany. So with all of the progress of CTV around the world, and the pressure on content owners, that is sometimes slightly different than other markets. But the general trend that is happening in the U.S. is happening there too, just with slightly less content. But that makes a bot even more valuable in some way that makes the add more scares. But it makes auction dynamics, and real time pricing even more valuable for those markets, which we think time just lends to our business model. So we expect to continue to lead in CTV around the world.\nBlake Grayson: And then the following up on your Q4 question. The quarter was fundamentally really strong. We have the hardest comp, that in a long time in Q4, compared against Q4 at '20. Not just because of the elections, but also because we have that ramp back at a COVID. That was really a real accelerator for us in 2020. So thinking about those issues, I think that the Q4 look really good. I know supply chain, issues to call out at all. I think you know, another data point is that you just look at a two year simple stack on growth rates in q4, just the year over year 20. And 21. Q4 was faster than the full-year for us. And so just goes to the strength and the momentum that we've seen in that, we've now kind of disclose now in our guidance. So we're really excited about.\nBrent Thill: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Matt Swanson at RBC. Your line is live.\nMatt Swanson: All right. Thank you guys so much for squeezing me in here. I'll ask too quickly, but first for Jeff, thinking about ramp time for shopper data. And kind of in two ways. One as far as how long it takes a partnership like what we're seeing with Walgreens to come together. And then also on the Walmart side, the milestones, you're thinking of how that's going to ramp over time. Recognize it early. And then for Blake Q1 guidance is really strong the 38% growth, even accelerating off the adjusted 36%. I guess the two things be one, you mentioned a really strong start to the year if you want to elaborate on that. And then is there anything from a seasonality standpoint, when we're trying to maybe make an inference to a full-year number that you would point out as being different or special in 2022? Thank you.\nJeff Green: First of all, thanks for the question, Matt. So the patient ramp up in shopper marketing data or retail data that is largely dependent on the strategy that we deployed. And of course, we agree on with the retailer, and then their ability to move fast. So it often takes some time because winning hearts and minds and then trying to be very strategic. And everybody is extremely sensitive about privacy today. So they're all doing lots of work to just make certain that they're respecting consumer privacy. One thing I just want to highlight on this point is that, especially brands, especially advertisers, who are in the business of creating long-term relationships with consumers, they don't want to piss off consumers. They don't want them to be upset with them. And so as a result, they're trying to make very deliberate choices, so that they can provide the very best to consumers. That of course, is bringing them personalization, while of course at the same time respecting privacy. In order to set up those structures and then also to create the right economics can be very different from partner-to-partner, partly because of their agility. But also, because there's a whole bunch of different ways to deploy that, that insight. It all, I think it at end days looks very similar, which is, people are trying to leverage their data so that every advertiser is optimizing to selling products in that store, whether it's Walmart, or Walgreens, or those that are next. And that is very good for the retailer. And that is providing end-to-end measurement that is more difficult to find in other environments, especially the walled gardens, where they're doing sort of measurement on their own without validation. So that holy grail of end to end measurement is coming from many retailers and the pace at which that is on boarded up to that.\nBlake Grayson: And then roof regards to your Q1 question, Matt. Yes, strong start to the year. It's broad based, I don't have anything unique to call out with regards to any single area to highlight. I think that it's just momentum we've seen in January that has continued in the, early part of February so far. And just the many positive trends for this business, which, you know, you hear us speak to a lot or just tend to continue, which is, CTV is leading the way we have exciting international opportunities, the shopper marketing opportunity as well. You've heard about Solimar ramping and UID scaling. And so just all those tailwinds, I think, you know, drove us essentially to that to that guide on the 38% year-over-year growth, which does represent the acceleration that you call that from prior year. With regards to your seasonality question, assuming no major disruptions, like related to the macroenvironment. So if that's COVID or if something from supply chain were to kind of be activated. It's possible that this year in 2022, and then 2023 start looking a little closer to have I would say the pre-pandemic years looked in terms of seasonality patterns, but that said. Every year is a little different. So if we're a few points better or worse for that from a seasonality perspective I wouldn't recommend reading into it too much.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Matt. And thanks for everyone for joining today.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This conclude today's event. You may now disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day.

Q4 2021 was another outstanding quarter for The Trade Desk and an exclamation point on a terrific year. Across the board, we exceeded all our goals for 2021 which culminated in crossing the billion dollar revenue mark, ending the year with $1.2 billion in annual revenue, an increase of 43% year-over-year. Total platform spend was almost $6.2 billion. It's only 10 years ago, May of 2011, when we received our first penny of spend, to think last year we passed $6 billion in spend. It is both astonishing and inspiring. I say that because I truly believe that we are just getting started with our innovation, our amazing team, our unrivaled customer service, and a growing roster of global partnerships, I am convinced that we will continue to outperform in an addressable advertising market that is racing toward a $1 trillion TAM. One aspect of our business in 2021 that was particularly encouraging was the pace at which we signed major customer agreements. As the year progress, we signed an increasing number of long-term commitments with some of the largest brand advertisers in the world. Last year, the Top 25 advertisers on our platform increased their spend on the platform more than 50% compared to the prior-year. And that's before some of these long-term agreements have fully activated. Momentum is also growing due to increased awareness and understanding of our value among brand marketers and their agencies. And I will just spend my time today looking back on the highlights of 2021, but also discuss the factors that are shaping 2022 into what I expect will be the most impactful year, TTD has ever had. I believe this will provide color on why brand marketers are increasingly gravitating to our platform. Looking back on 2021, one of the highlights was the launch of our biggest product ever, Solimar. As you know, we launched Solimar on 7/7, after years of investment. But as with any major platform overhaul, there's always the question of exactly what the impact will be. The answer is that Solimar has been an upgrade to our business in every way. It helps advertisers and agencies embrace completely new ways of thinking about data, measurement, goal setting and campaign optimization. And I'm pleased to report that as of today, the majority of ad impressions on our platform are now bought via Solimar. At the current pace, we expect to deprecate the legacy platform before the fourth quarter of this year. To accomplish a complete transition to the new platform within about a year is an impressive feat by anyone's standards. And it speaks to the value that advertisers are realizing with Solimar. Solimar was created to help advertisers make better data driven decisions at every step of the marketing funnel and in doing so take full advantage of the power of the Open Internet. We wanted to make setup easier and decisions more data driven. We also wanted to make certain that our AI and machine learning product branded as Koa was always on when the benefit was obvious. With a better blend of human and machine, advertisers can apply the right data automatically. And Solimar can optimize everything from predictive clearing to audience targeting to price discovery. Every ad campaign becomes more effective, every ad dollar is working as hard as it can. And as a result, the flywheel spins faster activating even more campaign dollars. Let me share some data about how the move to Solimar is going. First, co-adoption on Solimar is now over 90%, nearly 50% higher than with the legacy platform. Now nearly all of our advertisers are getting richer data driven insights and recommendations on how to reach and measure their target audiences most effectively and across the full scope of channels to optimize performance. In fact, average channel usage for Solimar campaigns has also increased about 50%. With Solimar, advertisers get a better perspective on cross channel performance and insight into how an omni channel campaign can take a consumer through an integrated advertising experience. And finally, and probably one of the most important changes. For those advertisers that have switched to Solimar, the average number of data elements applied to each impression has more than doubled. Many of the amazing results we are seeing from Solimar are due to restructuring of our data marketplace, and the courage of our data partners to try something new in the hopes of upgrading the entire Open Internet. As a result, Solimar is a bit of a twofer one, a better decisioning engine and a better data marketplace. Let me spend a moment on the improved data marketplace as it represents a significant upgrade to how the entire industry currently thinks about data and data pricing. Until now I would describe the marketplace for data in digital advertising is somewhat anemic. And that's largely because of the way that data has traditionally been priced across the web. In Walled Garden, data pricing is opaque with effectively zero price discovery. In the Open Web, historically data pricing has been more fixed than variable, which leaves little room for price discovery or even value discovery is akin to a real estate agent, charging a fixed dollar rate regardless of the value of the home that's been sold. In the case of data that has meant that each data element could be too expensive relative to the value of the impression. This also then becomes an inhibitor to advertisers who want to apply a full scope of data to every impression. But with Solimar and the new data marketplace, we have shifted our data pricing model away from fixed rates toward percentage of CPM. This would never have been possible without the support and commitment of the hundreds of data partners who participate on our platform and who were willing to make this change. This allows for much greater flexibility and data deployment based on both value and relevance. We have created a market where there's more accurate price discovery for data, which is more closely aligned to the value it creates instead of high fixed rates. Additionally, there's another major data marketplace design change that will fully roll out in the first half of '22. This change will address the major obstacle to cure the Open Internet data anemia. Currently, there is a disincentive to layer multiple data elements onto the same impression because the cost is prohibitive and price discovery has been a problem. With variable pricing now universal in our data marketplace, we can now add fractional pricing. This means we can offer for example, a basket of data options for customers that in total doesn't necessarily cost them more, but activates more data sources and pay supplier based on precise value created for the advertiser. In doing so data providers have the opportunity to make more money in aggregate. This creates incentive to use data whenever it adds value, and rewards data companies for the value they create. We expect that this will create the most robust data marketplace ever on the Open Internet. Not only will the Open Internet benefit, but we will be able to layer in more data significantly enriching each ad impression for the advertiser. In total, this increases the use of data. As we enrich each impression, advertisers on our platform become more effective and they invest more. Already our data marketplace changes have been so successful that we have seen advertiser bid win rates increase significantly, because they have been much more precise in understanding the value of each ad impression. Again, this means advertisers are inclined to spend more because they are achieving even better ROI making the flywheel spin faster. Looking back on another highlight from this last year, we blaze new trails in the rapidly emerging world of shopper marketing, another green field that is open to us because of the use of data. As of the fourth quarter, we're up and running with the Walmart DSP with select major advertisers. The initial results have been very encouraging. BIC is one of the early adopters as you probably know BIC is headquartered in France, but is a global leader in consumer products such as ballpoint pens, lighters, and grooming. And Walmart is a major retail partner for them. In December BIC ran holiday campaigns for some key products, including men's and women's razors using the new Walmart DSP. The results were even better than we hoped for. BIC achieved return on ad spend or ROAS of just under 500%. That means for every advertising dollar, they drove $5 in consumer purchases. This data is significant for a few reasons. First, with closed loop measurement, BIC is able to get a very rapid assessment of ROAS, the shopper data available in the Walmart DSP makes it much easier for brands like BIC to make the connection between campaign spend, and consumer purchase. And second ROAS of 500% is well above the industry average. According to Nielsen, a good ROAS as is around 270%. So to take an industry standard benchmark and almost double it is pretty staggering. Matt De Paolo is BIC Senior Manager of omnichannel growth, and he recently spoke about the power of the Walmart DSP. To quote him directly, he said, I don't want to overstate it. But this is something the industry has been waiting for, for a very long time. And now we finally have at our disposal, we had suspected that The Trade Desk would be a powerful complement to Walmart's capabilities, and this validated our suspicions. This represents the sentiment of many advertisers. They want retail data to help them improve and their ad spend in digital. They want to better understand how media moves people through the purchase journey. I firmly believe that 2022 will be the year that advertisers start to realize the power of shopper marketing. Walmart is leading the charge here. Amy Lanzi is the Commerce Practice Lead at Publicis for North America. She recently spoke with The Current, our online news site about how the Walmart DSP is capturing the attention of CMOs, who previously weren't as hands on with the retailers. To quote her directly, she said it used to be that you would negotiate how you've got a better display in a physical store now is a dynamic conversation that includes their digital shelves, and how brands can reach Walmart shoppers who are outside the retailers ecosystem. In the coming quarters, I'll have more to say about how we're partnering with other retailers in innovative ways to unlock the power of shopper marketing data for advertisers. As I mentioned, this is just one of the areas where brand marketing leaders are gaining a greater appreciation of the value of programmatic. When looking back on the amazing success and land grab year that was 2021, it is impossible to not spend some time talking about the rise of CTV. In 2021, CTV was once again the largest driver of spend on our platform. Last year, more than 15,000 advertisers spent on CTV on our platform, and we saw the number of advertisers that spent over $1 million in CTV, almost double compared to 2020. And I highlight, CTV again, because it is such an important driver of the brand shift to programmatic more broadly. For most brands TV is the largest element of their advertising campaigns. The TV team is often the power center of our brand marketing department as TV digitizes, thanks to the massive consumer shift to streaming, advertisers are embracing the power of programmatic in their most significant channel. Once TV advertisers realize its potential to focus rapidly shifts to the value of programmatic in an omnichannel context. And this is what I mean when I said in the past, that CTV is probably the most important driver of change across digital advertising. Of course, it is not just the consumer shift that's driving advertisers to embrace CTV. TV content companies are also evolving their models at warp speed, and we continue to partner with all of the major CTV providers worldwide. Each year, the inventory avails on our platform continue to rapidly increase. And as we enter this year's upfront season, I expect we'll continue to see large TV companies further prioritize CTV as a part of that process. Indeed, The Trade Desk has already been invited to participate in some of the digital upfront program this year. And while we've talked a lot in recent quarters about partnerships with major TV content companies in North America and Europe, the same dynamic is happening now in Asia, where viewers are also rapidly shifting to CTV, or OTT. For example, we recently launched with GYAO!, one of the fastest growing streaming platforms in Japan. Regardless of location, major brand advertisers increasingly realized the vital role that CTV plays in reaching audiences that have left or were never present on linear TV. We recently ran a campaign for one of Europe's top carmakers Renault in Spain, working with our agency, Omnicom. That campaign focused on a launch of a new SUV in Spain and Renault wanted to reach as many potentially interested car buyers as possible. With CTV, Renault achieved a significant double-digit incremental reach over linear, we're seeing the same phenomenon with brand advertisers around the world. They're embracing CTV as an essential element of their massive TV ad campaigns. And because of the outsized effect that TV has on most marketing departments, this growing adoption spins the flywheel faster for us across all advertising channels. Now switching gears a bit, I'd like to talk about the future and why 2022 is set up to be our biggest year ever, not just in financial performance, but also in strategic leadership, and increasing our market share. Yesterday, we announced another very big initiative, OpenPath. This is the biggest direct step we've made yet to improve the supply chain for our clients, us and the Open Internet. Let me take a moment to explain what this is, OpenPath is a product that enables content owners from TV and across the web to plug in to CTV directly. OpenPath is a direct pipeline to publisher inventory for any publisher that chooses to integrate directly with us. An inefficient supply chain is bad for advertisers and for publishers. We're very pleased to launch OpenPath with some of the largest journalistic publishers in the world, including The Washington Post, Conde Nast, Reuters, the Tribune, and USA Today. OpenPath is especially helpful for larger publishers and content owners that want to do their own yield management. We're not competing with SSPs or becoming an ad network, we represent the advertisers in the auction. Our goal in creating this product is to provide a high bid directly to publishers and content owners who want to do their own yield management. One of our core operating principles since our inception is the pursuit of a level playing field for digital advertising with transparency on all sides. We believe that's the best way to build trust in digital advertising, which will drive overall market growth and we also believe that on a level playing field, everyone gets to compete fairly on the value they provide. As a demand side platform, we're confident that on a level playing field, we will continue to outperform and gain more market share of the growing TAM. With this product launch, we also announced that we are no longer buying from Google so called Open Bidding or OB product. You may recall that Open Bidding is one of the main focus areas of recent antitrust lawsuits against Google, including the one from the Texas State Attorney General's Office. With this and as part of our ongoing supply chain optimization initiatives, we will continue to prune supply paths that are opaque, unfair or inefficient. That said, we plan to continue to buy on Google's Ad Exchange. Where all the SFPs that provide yield optimization for publishers, we expect that this product and policy change will result in more spend to them. You might be interested as to why we started with journalism in terms of our initial partners. Journalism has more stake than perhaps any other market segment here. Journalism relies on advertising. And the ad model for newspapers of 30 years ago has evolved into something very different today. It's vital that we preserve the value exchange of advertising for journalism content, because journalism is such an important factor in the free flow of trusted information in any functioning society. But OpenPath will scale to any publisher that wants a direct path to our demand. Let me just reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSP or the supply side business. This is not about that at all. We won't be getting into yield management or any of the various value propositions that a number of the great SSPs provide. Open path is simply a direct path in the inventory. This is something that our advertising clients have been asking us for a long time. And they become more aware of the supply side inefficiencies over the past few months. The impact will be positive for SSPs that have invested in their publisher relationships and are offering value in terms of yield management from companies such as Magnite, Pubmatic and Index Exchange. As with any maturing market, as it becomes more efficient, the companies that succeed will be the ones that provide clear value and differentiate themselves to customers.  As I said, we are launching OpenPath in partnership with some of the world's leading journalistic outlets. They have been incredibly enthusiastic about this initiative. Hopefully you saw some of the press coverage yesterday, but just to quote a couple of them. Conde Nast said, we are pleased to be working with The Trade Desk on OpenPath to enable deeper conversations with our clients about inventory transparency and performance. The Washington Post said, we have long believed that a more streamlined supply chain benefits both advertisers and publishers. And McClatchy said OpenPath aligns with our objective to build a transparent, well-lit digital ad environment, driven by journalism that strengthens the communities we serve. Those are just a few, but I could not be more excited about the early momentum for OpenPath. Of course, another area I'm especially excited about for 2022 is the progress the industry is making with UID2. More major publishers around the world are committing to UID2, and more advertisers are transacting on UID2 on our platform. KG Media, Indonesia's biggest media network, is the latest publisher in Asia to announce its support of UID2. KG boasts an extensive portfolio of publishing properties including newspapers, TV networks, and retail. They believe that UID2 is not just a replacement but a significant upgrade to cookies as a common currency of the open internet, creating a better experience for both consumers and advertisers. That was certainly the experience for CoCoVillage, a manufacturer and retailer of high-end children's toys and furniture, servicing the North American market. They wanted to secure an easy way to leverage their valuable first party CRM data to find new audiences for their products. Working with UID2 they were able to model new potential customer groups, drive incremental reach of almost 40%, and a return-on-ad-spend of more than a 1000%. Additionally, we believe many of the same publishers that are signing up for OpenPath will also sign up for UID2. We expect that these two products, which both improve the Open Internet, and will help to increase the adoption of the other. In addition to publishers and advertisers who are adopting UID2, important industry trade groups are also weighing in with their support. Perhaps one of the most important groups is the MMA, because they represent the voice of the brand marketer, and their board comprises many of the world's leading CMOs. I was invited to join their board last year, precisely because brand marketers want to be fully engaged in new approaches to identity and measurement. The MMA views UID2 as a solution that can solve for the identity needs of the open internet. To quote their CEO, Greg Stuart, directly: \"identity is the key to the future of marketing, and especially important to marketers in taking full advantage of the larger reach and need for transparency to consumer consent that the open web affords. UID2 has a great potential to be a solution that the whole industry can work on collectively to craft a compliant and effective identity solution for everyone. To finish, let me just summarize why I'm so bullish about 2022 and our future. More than ever, the biggest brands in the world appreciate the value of data driven advertising, and increasingly they are embracing our platform. I've spent time today talking about some of the more compelling recent drivers of that growing interest. And over the years, we have built trust with those advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver premium value to their campaigns. This business model is key in generating alpha in revenue and market share growth. We continue to have a customer retention rate over 95%. Our engineering teams continue to lead the industry in innovation, charting new value opportunities for our advertisers. As a result, we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Our profitability and positive cash generation allow us to make the long-term investments that will ensure we can continue to provide that premium value that includes Solimar, which is creating new value for advertisers by unleashing data and driving a greater return-on-ad-spend, spinning the flywheel for advertisers' campaigns. It's driving our leadership in CTV, the fastest-growing channel in digital advertising, and a driver of new thinking across the marketing spectrum. It positions us to make the supply chain that is more efficient for our advertisers and agencies in 2022, with initiatives like OpenPath. It enables us to do pioneer work in shopper marketing, a $100 billion market. You'll see us forge partnerships with major retailers worldwide, including Walgreens. Just yesterday, they announced that advertisers will be able to leverage new audience data services on our platform, based on anonymized Walgreens' shopper data. It has allowed us to become a leader in political advertising. 2022 will be an important midterm election year in the United States. We have spent years building an objective and independent platform, open to registered candidates on all sides, that can help drive discussions of substance in the political arena. In 2022 we will make meaningful progress with partners and industry bodies to make measurement better, especially for CTV and all digital spend outside of the U.S. Profitability and free cash flow will also allow us to invest for global growth. Roughly two-thirds of global advertising spend is outside the U.S. This is a major focus for us. Once again, we saw strong growth in our international markets in the fourth quarter, driven by CTV. In fact, our CTV share of spend more than doubled in Europe in the quarter. And we continue to open promising new markets, such as Taiwan, India, Italy and the Nordics, with impressive leaders who are making very rapid inroads. We are a global company and we expect our international revenue to outpace North America over the long-term because of the investments we're making in these markets. We are very well positioned for 2022 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we've discussed today. And what I'm most excited about is the shift we're seeing among more and more senior brand marketers. In a variety of dimensions, marketers are becoming more familiar and enthusiastic about programmatic advertising. Whether it's the performance value of Solimar, the holy grail of retail data, the CTV revolution, or new supply path models, they understand the power of data-driven advertising to help them differentiate and drive growth in their businesses. And that's the most rewarding thing of all. I could not be more excited about the opportunity in front of us and our growth prospects into 2022 and beyond. And with that, I'll pass the baton to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter. You bet. Well, first of all, thanks, Shyam for the kind words, I'm incredibly proud of the team. I'm proud of what we accomplished in 2021 and especially just an amazingly strong finish in Q4. And then I'm just equally encouraged by the momentum so far this year. So I just want to really underline that, because I do think that there's a lot of discussion, including much of my morning was just reading about Google's announcement. And I will just say, I'm incredibly encouraged by the way this is rolling out. So first, I don't believe that this will have a negative impact on our business. And I think it has a good chance of having a positive impact on our business. And so in order to understand that though, of course, you just have to acknowledge that Google is getting hit from all sides as it relates to antitrust scrutiny, as well as privacy scrutiny. So this move by Google is not a surprise, it's not like Android could just sit around and be the only platform not to pull back on implicit data sharing. But they created an amazing transition period, which I think is very good for the industry. And something that just they've learned from, I would say Apple's mistake on this. And the rhetoric is really focused on improving the Internet. And a lot of things that they're saying now are different than things that they've said in the past. So from our perspective, we say bring on the explicit opt in future. When the UID is present, and we get an opt in, great. And when we don't, we'll do modeling, and we're going to be fine, no matter what. I'll also just note that Google has recently of course, tested FLoC and topics, and neither have gone very well. And they haven't been very received very well in the antitrust discussions in particular, but also in especially FLoC's case, in the privacy discussions. So I'm really encouraged by Google pressing the point that they are committed to treating themselves equally as for their agreements with regulators. In other words, foundationally, Google needs targeted advertising. And as a result, that makes them a good partner of ours in this fight to just get things right between that balance of the quid pro quo of the Internet. As it relates to mobile specifically, mobile device IDs are of course, relevant to in app advertising. But that isn't all of mobile. So just important note there. And then, Facebook and others have to monetize every impression and most of those impressions are mobile, but we look at all the ad opportunities and choose the ones that are best. So I always use an example, it's not uncommon for a Fortune 500 company to be looking at $10 million to PSVR platform, and then they select the 1,250 that are the best for them. If that denominator changes a little bit, if it moves from $11 million to $10 million, then they just choose a different set of impressions. But I've used that before. In this case, that isn't actually the right way to think about this one, we're actually still getting the $11 million QPS, they're just slightly less appealing, because of perhaps less metadata. So we're still going to get to choose and it doesn't really change our value proposition at all, it does perhaps shift some dollars to impression that just have more metadata, most notably into CTV. But if I'm Google, and I just want to encourage everybody to think about this for a second, and I have to respond to all of these pressures from all these different areas. I actually want to see things like UID 2 succeed but I'm under way too much scrutiny to endorse it or especially to propose it myself, but I want to see it succeed. So in other words, I can't carry the ball, but I can block. To me what they did today is they are blocking. This is an amazing setup for UID 2, and it makes CTV advertising even more appealing. Everything at CTV has a login. And that login is controlled by the content owners. And those content owners none of them have a monopoly and none of them own a sizable OHS. So the login makes personalization up to the content owners. Lastly, related to this, Apple is doing more and more non-ad personalization using their Apple ID. I think this is indicative of the future. It's an opt-in future with clear consent to provide personalization perpetuating the very amazing quid pro quo of the Open Internet and to me that sounds a lot like what we've been after from the very beginning. So, like we said, bring on the explicit opt-in future. You bet, thanks Vasily. So first, Walmart has been a fantastic partner. We're working very closely to just pioneer new thinking about retailer and brand relationships, and of course, shopper marketing and retail data. As you know, we launched in Q4, it was really a test phase, where we had roughly 20 large brands that were running on a Walmart DSP, of course powered on our platform. We are continuing to just partner with more and more retailers. Most notably, we just announced yesterday, our partnership with Walgreens, where they are launching their own self service and cleanroom solutions on our platform. So I want to emphasize the shopper marketing TAM is at least $100 billion. A lot of discussion about antitrust these days and I don't think there's much antitrust reasoning to be in retail because of how fragmented and how many opportunities there are in that space. Of course, we're talking to many of them. And it's just a reminder, of really what closing the loop, the value of that sort of Holy Grail of retail data is about closing the loop.  So we read a lot about just measurement being affected in Facebook's earnings. But that is very different in a world where you have data on at the time of conversion. And so to me, like, all the landscape changes that have happened in the last few months are just actually pointing to the need for these retail partnerships, as well as the strategies that we're seeing deployed by many of the biggest retailers in the world. So we're very encouraged by it, we expect more partnerships to come. And we expect retail and shopper marketing to continue to grow, '22 is going to be an amazing year for that growing up. You bet. So let me first start by explaining that what Open Bidding is and then I'll talk about what OpenPath is because there's two separate strategic moves that were made on the same day. So earlier this week, we announced that we were doing these two things, the first of which was that we were no longer going to bid or participate in Open Bidding, or Google's alternative to header bidding. Many of you who've been involved with us for a while, remember that the advent of header bidding was one of the best things that ever happened to us as a company. And one of the best things that happened to the Open Internet. What header bidding did is it made the market more competitive and it took the publisher decisioning, of which ad to show away from Google and put it into this open source header technology. It's called header bidding, because it's code that just gets placed in the header tag of a webpage. But Google created OB as a response to it. And it definitely had a positive effect for Google. But we don't believe that it created a level playing field certainly favored some part over others. If you read that Texas Attorney General's complaint, and you read about Jedi Blue and some of the allegations there, those are all related to Open Bidding. So naturally, we wanted to turn that off knowing that nearly every publisher in there has another path to that inventory. So we don't lose out on any of the inventory, we just bias towards paths that are a little bit more transparent, and more fair, which we think is good for our advertisers and good for everybody else. So the only people that it's not good for those that were benefiting unfairly or wouldn't compete and wouldn't be able to compete in a fair marketplace. So, as a result, we also decided to launch OpenPath, which basically gives publishers the ability to integrate with us directly. Now I just want to be emphatically clear here. This is not us getting into the SSP business, at the core of SSP is providing yield management, trying to give publishers the highest yield possible. And they typically are trying to manage a large chunk of their inventory. Instead, what we're doing is we're enabling them to integrate with us directly. So in the cases where we want to bid, they will get that bid directly to them. And then they can compare that to their other sources of demand, so that they can do their own yield management, we expect this will often be the case with very large publishers. And we think this will have a very positive effect on the state of the supply chain, in both CTV and especially in journalism. We wanted to start with journalism, because that was the one most affected by header bidding for the positive and in some ways, most negatively affected by all the changes that have happened in the supply chain and the fight that's happening over identity. Meanwhile, there's all of these journalistic outlets that are trying to monetize as optimally as possible. And with all these feuds over identity, including many of which that are dependent on mobile apps, they need high CPM to just stay in business. So we're so excited that what this represents at launch is 70% of the newspaper readership in the United States, between Reuters, Washington Post's, USA Today, Hearst, Conde Nast, Tribune, and just many, many others. We think this represents just a huge lifeline to the journalistic community. I do want to just underline one more time, there is nothing more important to us than preserving our objectivity. That means that we're in this for the buyer, we're representing advertisers and agencies in the decisions that we make that will continue. We're just willing to transmit that bid directly to the content owner when it's possible, and when they want that. And as a result, we think that creates a more effective supply chain, and gives more momentum to the Open Internet that is largely being fueled by Connected TV. You bet, so first I'll just say I've never been more bullish on CTV than we are right now. And that's in large part because of all of our partnerships with the content owners. And again, just as we've integrated it with them directly more and more as time has gone on. And as we've seen them grow as we've seen them test AVOD, SVOD and hybrid models, we're seeing more and more of move towards AVOD. And that that speaks to your, I think the third part of your question, which is about what's happening to inventory. It started out that most of us that are consuming and I'm speaking as a consumer per minute, most of us did our consumption on Amazon and Netflix SVOD offerings. And then over time, we were introduced to things like Hulu and now so many others that are AVOD or hybrid, like in Hulu's case. And as we've learned from so many of them, it's often a better way for them to monetize, to be an AVOD company. And it also is what the consumer typically prefers as in Hulu's case, 80% of consumers prefer the ads. Now, some of that has been a phenomenon for many years. But that predates what I'll describe as what is now peaking, which is subscription fatigue. So that was true at Hulu many years ago, it's still it's even more true today because of course, there's more subscriptions, it takes more work to figure out where to watch, what you want to watch for the average American household to be paying for 15 subscriptions, instead of two or three that they were a few years ago, the cost is prohibitive. So in AVOD and now all of those companies are graded on subscribers, how many subscribers do they get, and just some pretty impressive numbers across the board. And just from many of them as we watched, how they recorded on their last year. But in order for them to keep those subscribers, they have to make it affordable. So we expect to see more and more of them adopting advertising, they need that to be relevant, so that they show a fewer ads that are more relevant to the user, so that they keep an amazing experience for the consumer. But then the consumer can also afford it. So I believe strongly. Excuse me, that's the most promising part of our future is in CTV because of those market dynamics. Now, the last part of your question about upfront. Basically, for those of you that are unaware of upfront process, what used to happen is everybody would come together at certain seasons of the year to buy all the ads on an upfront basis. And you would try to bet on the shows that you thought were going to be successful. And the model was really built before there was anything digital and when there weren't that many content companies. But nevertheless, there is still this desire to go to an event or an upfront schedule, and get some sense of plan for the rest of the year and get some sense of inventory and to make commitments, where sometimes big advertisers can use their size to get a better deal, if you will. And then publishers are willing to trade that better deal for assurances that they're going to get spent. But what's increasingly brought into the equation is the need for audience and data. And that's not really conducive to just signing an insertion order or contract that sells all the inventory to one company, you need to put your audience data to work, you need real time decisioning, you don't really know who's going to be watching, what the characteristics are. And so as a result, more and more of those upfront discussions are bringing us into the middle between those two entities, so that we can enable better decisioning and higher CPMs for the publisher, and of course, better decisions for the advertisers. So we're very encouraged by the invitation to the upfronts by the type of deals that are being struck, and by how often audience and full data decisioning is now being brought into upfront discussions, which we believe are going to transform the upfronts in years, over the next few years. But that's all good news for us. That's good news for decisioning. That's good news for CPM. That's good news for the TV landscape, which is getting more and more competitive and gravitating more and more towards AVOD. You bet. So first of all, thanks for the question. Excited to talk on both of these topics. So first, I was prepared to answer a question like this by saying something like, as I look back on last year, I don't think the momentum could have been any better. But now that I look at today's announcements from Google, I expect this to help our momentum. So when I say momentum couldn't have been any better. Given all the macro environment, it couldn't have been any better than but it's going to be even better now. So, our January avails with UID's presence reached an all time high in January, we continue to grow rapidly outside the United States. And we're just partnering all over the place with those that create infrastructure for the Internet. So many people don't, I think properly understand or value, the partnerships that we have, when we partner with companies like LiveRamp or a Snowflake that are providing infrastructure for the Internet. Many of the largest advertisers on our platform are now transacting a UID, or in the process of implementing Solimar does make that much, much easier to implement and OpenPath will have a huge impact on just accelerating UID as well, because as we integrate directly with many of the publishers, of course, the SDK will include both capabilities and some amount of encouragement that to of course implement UID so that we can provide more data driven advertising that provides higher CPMs. We're seeing significant increases around the world, maybe most notably in APAC, but the numbers are just very impressive. At this point, we're on over billions of devices. So with the footprint that we have today, we're incredibly encouraged. And then with these sort of other external pressures on other players, and the discussion on privacy and antitrust, those are actually creating secular tailwinds for UID 2.0, as it relates to Solimar, amazing attraction as well, I had hoped that we would have the majority of our impressions on it by this quarter, or at least by the end of this quarter. We did it last quarter, so now over 50% of impressions are bought on Solimar. We expect over 100% by the end of the year. And I think that could even come sooner if things go really well. But we are looking at 100% of impressions bought on our new product are on Solimar before the end of this year. So pretty amazing transition, given we just launched that on 7/7. But that's great. And it makes it so that we have a better user experience. And we think that we have more stickiness because that experience is also just much easier for people to use and make decisions. But it also is driving more data usage where that's the number of data elements applied to each impressions more than doubled. There's more usage of Koa, which is our AI and ML where adoptions now over 90%, average number of channels has increased by 50%. So channels being things like mobile, display, CTV, video, audio, so when you see that increased by 50%, what you're seeing is people being holistic in the way that they're buying, and for the first time ever we're doing I think unprecedented work and comparing apples to oranges in the media landscape. And then just seeing a massive increase in first-party data usage. And that has encouraged as well as enabled by UID as well. So I expect Solimar to have a positive impact on UID, which was already going incredibly well. I expect OpenPath to have a positive impact and I expect Google's recent announcements also have a positive impact on UID 2.0. So really, both of those things are some of the brightest spots of our 2022 ahead. We can, how are you, Laura? You bet. And I'll take first crack at the both questions and then if Chris or Blake want to add anything on the numbers, we don't break out any of our channels specifically as a total, I will say that CTV is definitely growing faster than the rest of our business. And I do believe CTV growth is leading the way, there's some unique things about comps and whatnot that I think they can talk about, but I don't think that's indicative of the growth of our business or the growth of CTV. So I'm not certain that that comparison gives you any insight into the business or CTV specifically. As it relates to the business model on our data marketplace, we do make money on the data that gets purchased. So it's not just about creating spend in media, we make money on all forms of spend meaning whether they buy media or whether they buy data. So we are incentivized to get data to be used more often. But of course, what we do is create models so that we never use the data and left, it is mathematically obvious to create benefit for the advertiser. And so what that has enabled is us to constantly be doing work to make certain that we're adding more value than we're extracting. That's actually one of the reasons why I'm so bullish about the changes that we've made to the data marketplace is there, we are creating way more value for the advertiser. Now on unit economics, we don't expect that to change. So in other words, I don't expect our take rate to meaningfully change in either direction, positive or negative as a result of this, but I do expect the flywheel to spin faster. We do make money on data however. So we're encouraged to either put it towards working media or put it toward data, but we better earn our keep, which is exactly what our clients want from us. The fact that we're using more data just means that we're using that data in an intelligent way to make certain that the incremental usage is worth it to the advertiser. The fact that's working across the board, I think is actually separating that from the path with everybody else, in part because we have that objectivity and alignment with the advertisers. Yes, so as it relates to OpenPath, we definitely see this as extensible into CTV, which we've already indicated will happen, but also potentially into mobile. So I think increasingly, publishers are interested in cleaning up the supply path. Increasingly, advertisers are interested in cleaning up the supply path. And we've always looked at it as we have to earn our keep, and everybody in the supply path does. And we just want to make it so that the market can be as efficient as possible because the Open Internet in order to compete with the Walled Garden strategy has to be operating efficiently. That requires a bit more moving parts. But that's a better global economy. That's a better ecosystem, that's a better internet for the world. And in order for us to enable that, we think we have to continue to enable direct integration when content owners and publishers want to do their own yield management. I think it's really important that you highlighted CTV because nowhere is a more true that content owners want to do their own yield management than in CTV. But I do want to underline that we are not trying to become an SSP. We are not getting into yield management, that is a job of an SSP, or in the case for content owners want to do it themselves. It's of course their job. But that's something that we believe in order to protect our objectivity, we should stay out of which we expect to do as far as we can see in the future. Thank you. Yes, I'm very excited about the international prospects. So I'm always -- I start macro, which is, we're a few years away from being at that trillion dollar Tam, and roughly 60% plus to that is outside of the United States or outside of North America. So, of course, we want to capture that opportunity. And because we work with the biggest brands in the world, who advertise all over the world, they don't want 200 DSPs as partners, they would like one, to take them all over the world and especially to use their learnings in any market to benefit all the other markets. And so, as of course, our focus has been on expanding CTV all over the world. CTV more than doubled across APAC, CTV and EMEA grew by more than Forex in 2021. Shanghai and Hong Kong have been driving our growth in Northern Asia Pacific. And just some amazing partnerships across APAC with Samsung Smart TV devices now reaching over 50 million viewers and that's having access there. Xiaomi in India or Disney+ Hotstar in India. Again, China was our fastest growing office again, which when the numbers are small, that's less significant, but when you do it over and over again, it continues to be it especially significant, especially when you look at China and just say that's the second largest media market in the world, it's roughly half the size of the U.S., but it's growing at twice the pace. So with that being true. We think that represents a tremendous opportunity. And we're in a unique position to many others who are looking at that market in that we are representing the largest brands in the world who wants to spend in China. So unlike many other non-China based companies, who've been hurt by trying to go into market in China, we come to the market, mostly with a focus spend in market. And then to do expansion where Chinese brands and products will reach all over the rest of the world, which of course, they want more distribution. So I'm very encouraged by the fact that, that we've seen all this growth in those in those areas. But I can't underscore enough how important it is for us to continue to lead in CTV, we believe we've done that in the U.S. And we've proved that in the U.S. and Australia, arguably years ago in 2020. In 2021, I think we started to show amazing green shoots across other markets in EMEA, most notably in the U.K. and Germany. So with all of the progress of CTV around the world, and the pressure on content owners, that is sometimes slightly different than other markets. But the general trend that is happening in the U.S. is happening there too, just with slightly less content. But that makes a bot even more valuable in some way that makes the add more scares. But it makes auction dynamics, and real time pricing even more valuable for those markets, which we think time just lends to our business model. So we expect to continue to lead in CTV around the world. First of all, thanks for the question, Matt. So the patient ramp up in shopper marketing data or retail data that is largely dependent on the strategy that we deployed. And of course, we agree on with the retailer, and then their ability to move fast. So it often takes some time because winning hearts and minds and then trying to be very strategic. And everybody is extremely sensitive about privacy today. So they're all doing lots of work to just make certain that they're respecting consumer privacy. One thing I just want to highlight on this point is that, especially brands, especially advertisers, who are in the business of creating long-term relationships with consumers, they don't want to piss off consumers. They don't want them to be upset with them. And so as a result, they're trying to make very deliberate choices, so that they can provide the very best to consumers. That of course, is bringing them personalization, while of course at the same time respecting privacy. In order to set up those structures and then also to create the right economics can be very different from partner-to-partner, partly because of their agility. But also, because there's a whole bunch of different ways to deploy that, that insight. It all, I think it at end days looks very similar, which is, people are trying to leverage their data so that every advertiser is optimizing to selling products in that store, whether it's Walmart, or Walgreens, or those that are next. And that is very good for the retailer. And that is providing end-to-end measurement that is more difficult to find in other environments, especially the walled gardens, where they're doing sort of measurement on their own without validation. So that holy grail of end to end measurement is coming from many retailers and the pace at which that is on boarded up to that. Thanks, Matt. And thanks for everyone for joining today."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you Jeff, and good morning everyone. We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, capping off a great year for our business. Q4 revenue was $396 million, a 24% increase from a year ago. Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections which represented a high-single digit percentage share of our business in Q4 of 2020, revenue increased approximately 36% year-over-year. That represented a slight acceleration from the prior year which is impressive considering we experienced a strong recovery at the end of 2020. For 2021, we ended the year with almost $6.2 billion in spend on our platform and nearly $1.2 billion in revenue, representing 43% year-over-year revenue growth. We also ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of just over $500 million and generated nearly $320 million in free cash flow in 2021. We are enthusiastic that the combination of our business strategy -- of being the default DSP for the open internet where we only represent the buy-side and avoid conflicts too often prevalent in our industry by those who own inventory, along with a proven business model that generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, is producing solid and consistent growth, as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market of around $1 trillion. We have been encouraged to see advertisers accelerate their shift to data-driven advertising in 2021. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the value that The Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they work to connect with their customers across our platform every day. For both the quarter and the full-year, Connected TV continued to be our fastest growing channel at scale around the world. As Jeff mentioned, Solimar is now over 50% adoption and we are seeing promising results as customers, on average, are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously. In Q4, our partnership with Walmart officially kicked off, UID2 had significant momentum and as we have consistently stated, we have seen no material impact on our business from the iOS platform changes in 2021. In addition to the strong top-line performance in Q4, we generated $192 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 48% of revenue. When we outperform on the top-line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, which it did again in Q4. EBITDA continued to benefit from temporarily lower than expected operating expense growth partly driven by the continued virtual environment that we are still predominantly operating in. Even recognizing that, we are extremely proud of our continued ability to substantially grow our top-line revenue while also producing meaningfully positive EBITDA. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. For Q4, Video, which includes CTV and mobile each represented the largest percent share of spend. Display, which also grew very nicely in Q4, and audio ended the year representing about 15% and 5% of our business, respectively. Geographically, North America represented 86% and International represented 14% of our business for the quarter. Shanghai and Hong Kong drove spend growth in Northern APAC and Australia and Singapore led our growth in Southern APAC. In terms of EMEA, our London and Paris offices led the way. CTV growth across EMEA was again quite strong in Q4, and still represents a fraction of the share of spend we see in North America. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them exhibited healthy growth during the quarter. Shopping, which includes ecommerce, Hobbies & Interest, and business were the strongest performers in Q4. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. The Law & Politics vertical decelerated materially year-over-year in Q4, as expected, due to the comparison against the 2020 U.S. election cycle. Operating expenses were $421 million in Q4, up 97% from a year ago. As expected, the growth in operating expenses during the quarter was driven primarily by stock-based compensation, specifically $158 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a long-term CEO performance award that was recorded in G&A expense. The $158 million expense included a tranche of the grant that accelerated based on stock price achievement and relative benchmark performance thresholds during Q4. In Q4, excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $216 million, up 23% year-over-year. For the full year, we gained significant operating leverage in both our platform operations and G&A areas as we scaled the business and improved our efficiency. Income tax was a benefit of $35 million in the quarter mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $208 million or $0.42 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $163 million and free cash flow was $151 million in Q4. The strong cash generation during the quarter was driven predominantly by our operating results. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis. DSOs exiting Q4 were 107 days, down 14 days from a year ago. DPOs were 91 days, down 10 days from a year ago. We exited Q4 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $959 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning now to our outlook. The year has started out strong and we estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $303 million which would represent growth of 38% on a year-over-year basis which is a slight acceleration over the prior year. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $91 million in Q1. Turning now to expenses. In 2022, we anticipate our stock-based compensation to rise from our normal run-rate. This is being driven by approximately $265 million of stock-based compensation expense we expect to include in 2022 related to the long-term CEO performance award. At the end of 2021, the performance award had $661 million in unrecognized stock-based compensation, which is expected to be included in our G&A expense over approximately four years but could be accelerated if the threshold criteria is met earlier than expected. The total amount expensed is unrelated to whether any of the performance award thresholds are ever met. Only shares that have met the threshold criteria outlined in the performance plan are factored into our total shares outstanding. Excluding the performance grant, for 2022, we expect total operating expense growth to increase on a year-over-year basis. Considering our ability to generate strong EBITDA and cash flow, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business with a massive available market in front of us that can generate long term growth, such as the generational shift to connected TV, the expanding retail data opportunity and the expectation that our international operations will grow faster than North America over the long-term. To help take advantage of those opportunities, we expect to increase our rate of hiring over pandemic affected periods and will do so in a competitive hiring market. We also expect that return-to-work expenses will begin to revert to pre-pandemic levels, including live events, travel and other related activities. Understanding all of that, we do expect the operating expense structure of the company to be better than it was prior to the pandemic, and over the long term expect Sales & Marketing and Technology & Development areas to represent a larger share of our investment. We are proud of the fact that we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that can consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We expect 2022 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be at least $75 million. We expect data center and infrastructure spend to drive the majority of the growth year-over-year and represent a larger share of our expenditures relative to office facilities compared to the prior year. And finally, with regards to tax -- absent any changes to U.S. tax laws, we expect our full-year 2022 tax rate to be about 25%. This is obviously impacted by any tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. In closing, we are pleased with the momentum of our business and the strong start to the year. We are highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. With large growth drivers such as CTV, our international business, our retail data opportunity that just kicked off in Q4 with the Walmart DSP, the 2022 mid-term elections in the US, and our recent platform upgrade in Solimar, I believe we have significant opportunities to grow our business. In addition, we are in a position to drive not only long-term growth but also to scale our business efficiently and continue to improve in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions And then Laura, I will just move on really quickly on top of Jeff, I think when you think about this, from a comparison perspective, the Q4 results of the 24% revenue growth, they're comparing against our hardest comp from last year because of the U.S. Election, which was a high single digit share of our spend. So when you exclude that Election spend, Q4 actually accelerated year-on-year from 34%, up to 36% in Q4 '21. So really encouraged by that because Q4 of 2020 also besides the Election comp, we had a kind of a pretty big flash recovery that came out in Q4. So we're pretty excited about that. And then with regards to the kind of wait for the next video, including CTV in mobile, each represent around 40% share of the business and then display and audio represent about 15% and 5% each, so that should give you some idea of that mix going to work. And just to follow on and even try to be more clear. We expect no material impact to P&L or take rate from this like just said, like, there's opportunities to spin the flywheel that we're excited about. And in the support of the open Internet. We don't have any incentive to steer purchases, and we're not doing yield management. It's -- we continue to represent the buy side in what we do. And so no material impact on the P&L side. And then the following up on your Q4 question. The quarter was fundamentally really strong. We have the hardest comp, that in a long time in Q4, compared against Q4 at '20. Not just because of the elections, but also because we have that ramp back at a COVID. That was really a real accelerator for us in 2020. So thinking about those issues, I think that the Q4 look really good. I know supply chain, issues to call out at all. I think you know, another data point is that you just look at a two year simple stack on growth rates in q4, just the year over year 20. And 21. Q4 was faster than the full-year for us. And so just goes to the strength and the momentum that we've seen in that, we've now kind of disclose now in our guidance. So we're really excited about. And then roof regards to your Q1 question, Matt. Yes, strong start to the year. It's broad based, I don't have anything unique to call out with regards to any single area to highlight. I think that it's just momentum we've seen in January that has continued in the, early part of February so far. And just the many positive trends for this business, which, you know, you hear us speak to a lot or just tend to continue, which is, CTV is leading the way we have exciting international opportunities, the shopper marketing opportunity as well. You've heard about Solimar ramping and UID scaling. And so just all those tailwinds, I think, you know, drove us essentially to that to that guide on the 38% year-over-year growth, which does represent the acceleration that you call that from prior year. With regards to your seasonality question, assuming no major disruptions, like related to the macroenvironment. So if that's COVID or if something from supply chain were to kind of be activated. It's possible that this year in 2022, and then 2023 start looking a little closer to have I would say the pre-pandemic years looked in terms of seasonality patterns, but that said. Every year is a little different. So if we're a few points better or worse for that from a seasonality perspective I wouldn't recommend reading into it too much."

At this time, all participants have been placed on listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions and comments after the presentation. . It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth. Sir, the floor is yours.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk, Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are founder and CEO, Jeff Green, and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, and results of our operations, in addition to potential supply chain disruptions that could disrupt advertising spend are all subject to change.  Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections. Are those implied by these forward-looking statements? I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data.  A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the Company's operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm here in Europe this week meeting with some of our colleagues, customers, and partners. And I'm thrilled to be joining you from our recently reopened London office. For Q3, I'm pleased to report that The Trade Desk had another very strong quarter. Revenue was $301 million, a 39% increase from a year ago. Once again, exceeding our own expectations.  Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections in Q3 of last year, our growth was about 47% from a year ago. This performance builds on our momentum year-to-date. I'd like to start by sharing five major highlights from this last quarter. First video, which excludes connected TV accounted for nearly 40% of our business.  Our highest ratio ever, and our CCB growth has not just here in the U.S. Like last quarter, CCB spend grew more rapidly in EMEA than any region in the world. The second in Q3, our international growth once again outpaced the domestic growth. A trend that we expect to continue over the long term. Internet expansion also continued at a strong pace. Third, the Walmart DSC recently launched, which is of course built on top of The Trade Desk platform.  It is early days, but we are starting to see test budgets from some of the largest brands in the world flows through the platform. And perhaps most exciting, these budgets are incremental. Fourth, unified ID continued its strong industry-wide momentum and is reaching critical scale in the market. And fifth, our mobile business continues to be resilient.  As we predicted, the most recent IOS changes have had no material impact on our business, and we expect that to remain the case. With that, I'd like to give you our perspective on the state of the market and then getting into a few ways in which we are innovating to drive growth in this market. I get asked every day about where this market is heading because the pandemic has changed everything, because it has massively adjusted the media and tech landscape.  It has accelerated the shift to TTV, it forced brand marketers to embrace data, and has driven a higher focus on real-time agility for everyone in our industry. I think this is an important backdrop to why we're doing so well and why our prospects are so bright for the future. And why I'm so optimistic about the future of the open Internet.  Just as a reminder, according to IDC, the total advertising market today is estimated to be at about $750 billion. In just a few years and is estimated to exceed 1 trillion though. And over time, I believe that nearly all advertising will be digital and nearly all of it will be executed programmatically. As that shift happens, accelerated by the pandemic.  Our commitment to the open Internet only intensifies everything we do in terms of our investments are engineering priorities, our partnerships, and our go-to-market model are design to create a better Internet. And we want the Internet that is open, privacy safe, and competitive, not one that's just owned by a few companies.  And as we work to advance the open Internet, we have a level of support from Ad agencies, advertisers, industry bodies, TV content owners, and the independent ad-tech that is unprecedented. We never thought that our vision would be shared by so many companies outside of our own Company. More than ever, companies and marketers are concerned about the Internet being fair and competitive.  And many of them are looking to us to help the Internet reach its potential. It's also in that context that many people in recent weeks have asked about our response to the unredacted version of the antitrust complaint against Google filed by a multi-state coalition led by the Texas Attorney General.  Of course, the majority of the complaint alleges, among other things, that Google has engaged in unfair and anti-competitive conduct using this market power built on top of DFP, which is Google ad serving product per publishers. I expect that Google will take steps to make the market fair given the scrutiny that they are under. Well, that would be a positive development for the industry, as well as good for The Trade Desk.  I want to remind everyone that we have been we are and we expect to continue to do very well regardless of Google's policy choices. A very small percentage of our business runs through Google's ad exchange and we're not dependent on Google for our business. The bottom-line for us, is that the market will always ultimately gravitate to transparency and competition over time.  And we will continue to innovate to drive the industry in that direction, and to deliver more value to our advertising customers. And if we get that right, and I believe we are as you can see in our performance, we will grab more share of ad spend. To that end, I'm obsessed with the supply chain. The healthier the supply chains, the more competitive and transparent the Open Internet will be, certainly in contrast to wealth gardens.  Of course, we only serve the buy-side and that will never change, but serving the buy-side demand that we do our part, working with the industry, to make sure the supply chain is as efficient as possible so that everyone in the ecosystem provides more value than they extract. And we are innovating in the supply chain in ways that are not always obvious.  In the last few months, for example, we've been working with the supply side to further reduce the duplication of ad inventory. Because publishers use multiple supply side platforms or SSPs, we often have access to the same inventory from multiple sources. We've asked those SSPs to put in place a solution that identifies duplicative inventory so that we ensure bidding on the right impression at the right time, all the time.  There has been an overwhelming support and adoption for this approach as that increases the overall efficiency of supply chain. In the same vein, I also want to address the future of identity for the open Internet. UID is setting new benchmarks every week and every month. The growth is phenomenal. As I've said before, I've never seen the industry come together like this around a common agenda, collaborating on new technology that benefits all participants.  The daily avails on our platform with UID reached an all-time high just last week having broken record dozens of times through August, September, and October. The scale we have been able to build in a relatively short amount of time has been outstanding. And it's thanks to unprecedented industry-wide commitment and collaboration.  Everyone in the open Internet is aware that Google has announced that they intend to get rid of third-party cookies in 2023. I maintain that this is a strategic mistake for Google to do that, but their policy changes have created collaboration among the open Internet, that probably wouldn't have happened otherwise.  When fully implemented, we believe UID creates a better Internet for consumers with higher standards for consumer privacy than anything possible with cookies. And the momentum and adoption of UID2 underscores that. Even some of the walled gardens are passing an encrypted version of UID2 in their marketplaces and ecosystems.  But one amazing new milestone is that many of the largest advertisers on our platform are now transacting on UID2, or are in the process of implementing it. As you'd imagine, some of these are among the biggest advertisers in the world, and nearly all of the major ad agencies and holding companies like Omnicom prove versus  IPG, and even independent agencies like Horizon have also adopted UID2.  And the case studies are just starting to roll in because a common currency makes it easier for our brand to use first-party data than cookies ever could. They are using that data more often and more safely. One early case study is with maiden made in one of the fastest-growing cookware companies in the U.S. They are using UID2, the new industry identity currency in their campaigns and seeing the amazing results.  They have seen a 20% improvement in cost per acquisition. Not just that, but they're seeing their time to convert per user improved by 33% compared to when they don't use UID2. That means they're driving campaign precision and putting their advertising dollar to work as hard as possible. As a reminder, UID2 started with us, but it belongs to the Internet today.  It is open source and being used around the world and across many functions of the Internet, from payment companies, to cloud companies, to beverage companies, to agencies, to exchanges. New ideas, making the open Internet more effective. Meanwhile, CTV is expanding the open Internet in new ways.  Since March of 2020, everything has changed about TV. The move to CTV over that time has been the fastest secular shift we've seen at The Trade Desk ever before, the pandemic CTV was getting premium CPMs because of scarcity of AVOD inventory. Now AVOD inventory is growing rapidly and premiums require improvements in efficacy. That means advertisers need an objective platform more than ever.  A platform that does not own content or its own content channel. A platform that helps advertisers decides what to buy objectively while managing reach and frequency. And that's a major reason so much CTV demand is gravitating to The Trade Desk. Lastly, concerning the state of global advertising market today, roughly 2/3 of the total advertising market is outside of North America.  That's why we invest so heavily in key growth markets globally. In recent months, we've established a presence in markets like India, Italy, and the Nordics in Taiwan. And we're making very encouraging strides in every region where we are located. To wrap up our perspective on the state of the market, I'd like to circle back to where this all started from. I believe digital advertising is still a relatively young industry.  I got into this business initially because I thought there was a better way to price advertising that we could build something like the stock market or the markets for commodities, where there is transparency and -- of information and mechanisms that drive efficiency. Because these are the kinds of characteristics that any market demands. That any mature market creates overtime.  This approach remains central to our mission at The Trade Desk. We believe that an open, competitive market for digital advertising is the only way that we build long-term trust of marketers. It's how we unlocked that $1 trillion industry TAM. The bulk of which will be digital. But now, given all the opportunities created for us in this fast changing landscape, I'd like to talk about a few things that are driving us to win more shares during this unique moment in time.  On 77, we launched the biggest upgrade to our system ever. In terms of adoption we're exactly where we expect it to be. By the beginning of 2022, the majority of impressions on our platform will be bought via Solimar. Feedback from our customers has been very positive. They value the platform  the ability to be more granular in setting goals, and how Solimar activates on those goals.  Everything from campaign optimization to more meaningful measurement, just as important, the use of both precise goal setting and activation for first-party data has increased the ability of our AI to better optimize every campaign with data. Our goal is for advertisers who activate Solamar to utilize more data  and achieve measurable improvements in return on ad spend.  In doing so, that helps the advertising flywheel spin much faster. We're also getting very positive feedback from industry analysts. Gartner just released their Ad Tech Magic Quadrant for 2021. The Trade Desk continues to be a market leader scoring highest for completeness of vision. Perhaps more interesting though -- Gartner measures all participants across 4 critical capabilities.  The Trade Desk ranked number 1 for 3 of those: media planning, campaign piloting and campaign results analysis. Each of these is key elements of Solamar. When you consider that we're going up against some of the tech industry's heaviest hitters, such as Google and Amazon, it's pretty remarkable to be leading the pack in these categories. And that's credit to our amazing engineering and product teams and the work that they put into Solimar.  It also speaks to the focus we have on customer service. We're always looking to provide more value than we extract. But I think what's perhaps less well understood is the role that Solimar is plan and driving innovation for our customers and for the industry. Solimar is allowing us to advance ideas and efficiencies that are benefiting the entire digital advertising ecosystem. One of those areas is our measurement marketplace.  Instead of only using our metrics, we've created an entire marketplace to measure success. Having this marketplace makes end-to-end measurement possible at unprecedented scale. And nowhere is this more apparent than in retail. You all know about the partnership with Walmart, which is now available to many of the world's largest advertisers. Major brands such as PepsiCo, are already active testing campaigns in the Walmart DSP.  Walmart is clearly a pioneer here. What they are doing is unleashing their shopper data so that advertisers can understand the relationship between their advertising tactic and actual in-store or e-commerce activity. We think about this and closing the loop. For many of our largest CPG advertisers, for example, the bulk of their products are still sold in physical stores.  If they run an ad for toothpaste, they can now get a much better sense of how that actually drove sales, thanks to in-store shopper data. This means that advertisers can be much more precise and agile in everything they do at every stage of the advertising funnel. Advertisers can understand the impact of their campaigns at a micro level in a particular region, a specific store or at different times of day.  They can also look at their impact across different channels; which ones are working and what kind of created. But it's not just Walmart. We are now working with many of the major retailers in the U.S. and many more around the world. They will each approach it in their own way but major retailers everywhere are looking to make the most of their own shopper data.  So that they can provide the same kind of closed loop measurement via our platform to the Bond side. And they are joining forces with us because they trust us. They know we don't compete with them, and they know they will retain control of their data. Similar to when an operating system is upgraded, there were many upgrades to key features on Solimar. One of those features is called predictive clearing.  What this means is that we use our data tools on our AI to predict the clearing price of first price option. Advertisers can then bid as close to the winning price as possible without overpaying. With Solimar's upgraded predictive clearing, we've massively upgraded the product to use AI to help our customers save collectively tens of millions of dollars.  That's because this upgrade allows us to be much more aggressive in bidding and budget management, significantly lowering CPMs and increasing an advertiser's return on ad spend. We're seeing predictive clearing improvements resulting in the reduction of CPMs across-the-board of customers that have activated this feature thanks to the Solimar upgrade.  These kinds of efficiencies are important to all of our customers but they are particularly attractive to the brand marketers who are increasingly paying attention to programmatic and to efficacy. One long term effect of the COVID pandemic is that there is more pressure than ever, on brand marketers to show ROI for their marketing investments. And to show how their campaigns are driving business growth.  As a result, brand marketers are putting a premium on data and measurability. And Solimar is proving to be tremendously beneficial here. One area where we're making a great deal of progress. Is new ways of thinking about the marketplace for data, and how Solimar ensures we surface the right data at the right price? Of course, our customers have always used data to drive their campaigns.  But the market for that data has not always been efficient. Advertisers would have a sense of what kind of data they want to apply, say, ad group, or Geo-location, and they would go find the data for the campaigns in a fairly analog way. With Solimar, the process of finding the right data for each impression is way more automated.  Because of more first-party data usage and more precise school studying in Solimar, our AI tools automatically find the right data for each impression that our platform is bidding on. What that also means though, is that Solimar may surface many more points of data that are relevant and valuable to a campaign and its goals. If an advertiser has been using 2 or 3 data points up yesterday on Solimar, they will be using more.  As a result of more data, the ad impression is much more enriched. Is more valuable and precise and drives better return on ad spend. The last I would like to touch on is our continued growth in CTV. I spoke to -- at an event a few weeks ago called Media and Montage. Because COVID, it was actually held in the tenth in Manhattan. And a few of you may have actually been there. The event brought together many of the leaders of the media industry.  And there were some fascinating discussions around the future of TV. I noted that when I commented, as I have before, that linear or cable TV, is a ticking time bomb. And soon everyone will consume content via CTV. There was much more agreement than in years past. The notion that TV is moving to the Internet, is not nearly as controversial as it was 2 years ago.  And clearly not lost on the industry with COVID has accelerated the consumer shift to digital streaming platforms. I think perhaps what maybe a little less appreciated are the scale, the speed, and the permanent of that shift. It's happening fast. In terms of scale, we've already reached receiving point. Today, we reached more U.S. households via CTV than via traditional linear TV.  But the point about speed was really driven home at the Adweek conference, a couple of weeks ago. Our Chief Revenue Officer, Tim Sims was onstage with brand leaders at Anheuser -Busch, Volkswagen, and Colgate Palmolive. And unprompted those advertisers said they believe that the majority of TV advertising will be executed programmatically on CTV within 3 years.  It was a fascinating insight into the future of TV that's worth a lot of replay if you want to understand where this industry is headed. Pre -pandemic, we have much longer sense of the time horizon for that kind of transformation. But changing consumer habits have accelerated everything so that we have access to the best and broadest portfolio of premium CTV inventory, both here and around the world. Nowhere is that more apparent than in live sports.  For a long time, many TV industry insiders felt that live sports would be the tent pole that would prop up linear TV. But once again, consumers have voted, and they are switching to digital platforms to watch their favorite teams. We added the NDA lead past package from Turner Sports to our CTV inventory listed season. Viewership on this platform increased around 50% last season.  And their head of digital strategy, Seth Latesty, believes that digital viewers are much more leaned in, to quote him directly. The digital audience we see tends to be stickier because they are really seeking out the content specifically, there are deeper engagements versus someone sitting back on the couch and watching it.  E-marketer estimates that there are almost 60 million digital sports viewers in the U.S. right now, rising to more than 90 million over the next 3 years. The notion that live sports will save linear TV is fanciful. Which is why so many broadcasters are pivoting rapidly? The number of impressions we see for the NFL, for example, is up almost 6-fold this year.  We're also very excited that we've recently added a Peacock, which in addition to amazing original content, also both premium live sports franchises such as the NFL, the English Premier league and of course, the Olympics. As you can see our results, demand for CTV continues to outpace all other channels for inside and outside North America. I don't see that trend changing for the foreseeable future.  Video is the most effective way to reach consumers heart to mind. And advertisers are following the TV audience to new digital platforms. At the same time, content providers are working with us directly so that we have access to premium CTV inventory at scale. I'd like to wrap this up by bringing this back for the market opportunity. The total advertising industry is moving rapidly towards that $1 trillion.  The bulk of that will be digital and marketers are embracing data-driven decisioning more aggressively than ever; our long-term investments have positioned the Company to capture this opportunity in the years ahead. Solimar and is an innovation platform that is creating new value for advertisers because of how it unleashes data and drives greater return on ad spend.  UID2 is becoming a more widely used identity currency across the entire global open Internet and we continue to invest so that we can lead in CTV, the fastest-growing channel and digital advertising. Consumers are driving advertisers and TV content providers to rethink the future of TV, and that's going to be data-driven. These are our priorities because this is how we see the industry evolving.  I hear the same things in every customer conversation I have, regardless of industry or geography. And that's why more of the world's leading advertisers are standardizing on our platform and our retention rate remains over 95%. It's why the major holding companies are embracing UID2. I am why Walmart is partnering with us as they unlease their retail data. It's why SSPs are working with us to optimize the supply chain.  I could not be more excited about our growth prospects as we close out this year and head in to 2022 and beyond. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Blake before moving Q&A. Blake?\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. As our financial performance in Q3 indicates, we continue to execute well in the current environment. Connected TV continued to be our fastest-growing channel at scale around the world. Solimar has ramping on plan. The Walmart DSP is now available, and as we have consistently stated, we have seen no material impact on our business from the recent IOS platform changes.  The value of our business model, being the largest independent DSP focused on the open Internet, continues to resonate strongly with our customers and has allowed us to build trust over the long term. Our appeal is the simplicity of our partnership. We focus exclusively on the buy-side, hunting for the impression opportunities that are the most valuable for our customers without the conflicts of owning inventory.  When we deliver value for customers on a campaign, they almost always, return for future ones, which have led to a retention rate of over 95% across the previous 7 years. Q3 was an incredibly strong quarter and a testament to our belief that advertisers are accelerating their shift to data-driven advertising in 2021, revenue of $301 million was up 39% from a year ago.  Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections last year, which represented a mid-single-digit percentage share of our business in Q3 of 2020, revenue increased approximately 47% year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from continued growth in the digital advertising environment from both agencies and brands. Our performance in Q3 was broad-based across all channels, regions, and nearly all verticals.  We continue to grow our top line quickly while scaling our cost structure efficiently, helping drive meaningfully positive EBITDA. In Q3, we generated $123 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 41% of revenue. During the quarter, our EBITDA continued to benefit from temporarily lower than expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment.  This includes items such as travel and live Company events that are very gradually starting to return to our core structure. From a scale channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter, aching Q3 video, which includes CTV and separately mobile, represented just about 40% each as a percentage share of our business. Video as a percent of our mix specifically continued to grow rapidly.  Similar to last quarter, the increase in video was driven by CTV. Display in audio represented about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented 88% and international represented 12% of our business for the quarter. APAC led our growth across all regions this quarter, Shanghai and Hong Kong drove spend growth in Northern APAC and Australia and Indonesia led our growth in southern APAC.  In terms of EMEA, London led the way nearly doubling year-over-year in Q3. As Jeff highlighted, CTV across EMEA was again, very strong, growing faster than any other region in Q3. CTV continues to rapidly increase its relative share of spend in Europe. While still small compared to the share of CTV spend produced in North America. We are optimistic about the trends we're seeing that set us up well for next year.  In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend; nearly all of them grew very nicely during the quarter. Travel, shopping, and home and garden were the strongest performers in Q3. We believe there's still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Operating expenses were $221 million in Q3, up 27% year-over-year.  The growths in operating expenses during the quarter were primarily driven by investments in our team, particularly in areas like technology and development, and sales and marketing. It is these areas that drive our business as we continue to scale for longer-term growth. During the quarter, we saw encouraging leverage from both our platform operations and G&A expenses as we scale the business.  Stock-based compensation expense increased 28% year-over-year. As expected, this marked a sharp deceleration from the first half of the year as expenses related to the Company's employee stock purchase plan moderated significantly. Income tax was approximately $20 million for the quarter, representing a tax rate of about 25%. Adjusted net income for the quarter was 89 million or $0.18 per fully diluted share.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $130 million, and free cash flow was $103 million in Q3. A strong cash-generation during the quarter was driven predominantly by our operating results. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis.  DSOs exiting Q3 were 87 days down 14 days from a year ago. DPOs were 73 days down 9 days from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $799 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet.  Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $388 million, which represent growth of 21% on a year-over-year basis, excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a high single-digit percent of spend that we've benefited from in Q4 of 2020. Our estimated growth rate in Q4 this year will be about 33% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $175 million in Q4. And finally, we anticipate our stock-based compensation to rise in Q4 from our normal run rate. This is being driven by approximately 95 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense we expect to include in Q4 related to a long-term CEO performance award granted on October 6th. The performance option has a grant date, fair value of 819 million in stock-based compensation.  Which is expected to be included in our G and A expense over approximately five years? The total amount expense is unrelated to weather any of the Performance Award thresholds are ever met. The only shares that have met the threshold criteria outlined in the performance plan are factored into our total shares outstanding.  In closing, we are pleased with the momentum of our business with large growth drivers such as CTV, our international business, our shopper marketing opportunity, which just kicked off with the Walmart DSP a few weeks ago, and our recent platform upgrade in Solimar. We remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond.  I believe we have the structure in place to continue driving long-term growth while scaling our business efficiently. I am cautiously optimistic about continued improvement in the future. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions.  We do ask that if you are listening on speaker phone, to please pick up your handset for optimum sound quality. Please hold for just a moment while we poll for questions. And our first question today is coming from Shyam Patel at Sig. Your line is live. You may begin.\nShyam Patel: Hey guys. Congrats on the results. I had a couple of questions. First 1, for Jeff, you guys reported great 3Q and 4Q outlook. When a lot of your peers are struggling and calling on macro issues. I wanted to ask a question about next year, just at a high level. Can you just talk about how you view the setup and the key drivers as you head into next year? I know you touched on a lot of them on your prepared remarks, but just asking in the context of next year.  You guys have CTV, Shopper Marketing International Solimar political. And then second one for Blake. I know you guys haven't given specific guidance for next year yet, but could you just talk a little about how you're thinking about revenue seasonality next year just -- given that the past couple years maybe -- have been a little bit abnormal?  Just how you think about revenue seasonality next year. And then, I guess specifically, 1Q revenue tends to be down in about 25%, 26% sequentially. Is that a reasonable assumption at this point? Thanks, guys.\nJeff Green: So first of all Shyam, thank you for wishing us congratulations as well as just the question. I'm really excited about '22. I don't know that I've gone into a year more excited than I am going into '22. Apart of kinds things that are happening outside of our control. So the first is that the regulatory environment is actually really net positive.  So if Google and Facebook are a little bit more controlled or maybe forced to make more deliberate decisions or what's even more likely is that they go a little bit slower, that's a net positive for us given how much they've gained share over the years. Of course, things outside of us too changes in IOS and a lot of discussion this earnings season about supply chain challenges.  We don't see any material impact from IOS, and we don't see any material impact from supply chain. So if given that, it makes me even more excited about the things that are going really well. So first of all, we're consistently grabbing share. So just constantly getting more than the space is growing.  Second, we've never seen what's happening in CTV happen in any channel ever before. And I don't know if we'll ever see something like that happen again. But cord cutting, accelerating, I mentioned that cable subscriptions are a bit of a ticking time bomb. If that weren't enough results of subscription fatigue in live sports, returning the upfront last year was a little bit of a struggle.  We anticipate that that's going to create more and more opportunity for CTV and stock market, which is always programmatic. And then here on -- I'm in London. Just what's happening here in the UK as well as across the EMEA in CTV has incredibly developed. Then across the world in international detained CTV is growing faster than in the U.S. That's not enough Shopper Marketing is going incredibly well. We just went live with the largest retailers. In the world, which is creating closed loop measurement and that's the first of what I predict to be many to come like that. In '22, we have a midterm elections, which we think there has been some forecasts that basically the spend in digital will be the same as the presidential election year. So we think that macro estimation is good for us as well. And then we just shipped a new product and Solimar. So that's going incredibly well, which I'm sure we'll talk more about. And then UID it just going incredibly well. So everything is going great. To just give 30 seconds on the seasonality before I -- like answer. In general, the market was heading towards digital being always-on. And so there's less of a ramp and a difference between Q1 to Q4 where there was this ramp that was caused by seasonality. And there's just an always on mindset inside of digital, which should it changes everything. But before 2020, we were heading toward, what we predict it to be 4555, where 45% of the spend is in the first half of the year and 55% is in the back half of the year.  It's really important to note that 2020 because of global pandemic changed all of that. It's such an anomaly. 2021 is a little bit more normal, but both of those are anomalies, given just all the changes in the world and we expect '22 to be a bit more normal. But I'm sure Blake has more to say about that.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. Just to reiterate what Jeff said, I think the sequential growth seasonality; it's obviously changed a bit, over the last 18 months or so, during dealing with the impacts of COVID.  I do believe we seem to move closer back to that normal historic seasonality trend, but it's still a little bit early difficult to say exactly where the new normal seasonality ends up, but it does feel like we're getting back on that more normal historical trend.\nShyam Patel: Got it. Thank you guys.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov at Cannonball Research. Your line is live, you may begin.\nJeff Green: You're there Vasily?\nVasily Karasyov : Hello, sorry. Can you hear me?\nJeff Green: Yeah.\nVasily Karasyov : Okay. Jeff wanted to ask you to go into more detail about what you're seeing after Walmart DSP went live. What kind of additional color and takeaways do have now and how does that inform your view of the size of the opportunity for the Company? And then are you having any discussions with the retail? So if you could give us some update on that would be great.  And also your view on how material over an opportunity being closed loop measurement can be for The Trade Desk and that will be an important business line or is it going to be just incremental, nice incremental revenue?\nJeff Green: Thanks for the question Vasily. So, as it relates to the Walmart DFP, so it's always better to just start with the very biggest in the world. Just phenomenal that we were able to create this partnership in closing the loop with the biggest retailer in the world. But we're only a couple of weeks in. So of course, we're looking at as green shoots and the potential ahead of us.  That potential is obviously massive with sharper marketing being a $200 billion industry. When you look at what we're doing and spend and revenue, that's just a tiny, tiny percentage. Our entire Company is a tiny percentage of that shopper marketing TAM. We think, whereas eligible as anybody for that.  And that to me is the real hope of the Shopper Marketing and what we are demonstrating here with Walmart. Because still especially in the U.S., most purchases are still made offline, the fact that most of the -- the advertising spend is online, there is a deep need to bridge the gap, to connect the dots between those 2.  And what has been happening over the years is that retailers like Walmart, have tried to monetize their data by creating what we used to call ad networks, which are these little silos where they would sell their data on their own. To me, the most exciting thing is that the retailers are recognizing that in order to compete with Amazon, they have to put their data to work in a much bigger way.  And that is to close the loop so that instead of getting that $10 million from one of the biggest brands in the world who spend billions, to instead getting those big CPGs or soda companies or whatever, to optimize spending their billions, to selling product inside of those brick-and-mortar stores or even in their e-commerce efforts so that they're measuring all their marketing spend success by how they sell product in those stores.  So, for the first time ever I believe the retailers and the product owners are aligned in what they want, which is something much bigger. So because Walmart, the biggest, has gone first, it is not a surprise that all other retailers all over the world are saying we need to execute the same playbook, and we need to do more.  And so we're talking to dozens of retailers, all the names I suspect that you would predict. And when you look at that in totality, it is definitely one of the most bullish things that we're working on right now. And I'm really encouraged and excited and proud to be Walmart's partner. But I'm just equally excited about all the partnerships ahead for us.\nVasily Karasyov : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Tim Nollen at Macquarie. Your line is live. You may begin.\nTim Nollen: Thanks a lot. Jeff wanted to ask how the Solimar rollout is going and maybe how that goes. If it's a matter of converting existing users to this new platform or just basically how you progress with that. And relatedly as part of Solimar, you've talked about the data and the measurement marketplaces.  I think I understand in principle how a data marketplace might work. I think you described that, but how does the measurement marketplace actually work? What does that mean? I mean, I guess you user UID 2.0 is means of identifying users. But whatever sorts of measurement are you including in that, and how does the marketplace work? Thanks.\nJeff Green: So first let me just say, we launched this product on 77 and so we're only in this about four months. The reception, especially given that it was our biggest release in the history of the Company has been unbelievable. Unbelievably strong and it's re-learning a new platform. So when you're -- when you're re-learning, especially in a year that has been as busy as this one, and especially with the talent shortages that exist inside of ad agencies and even brands.  And even to some extent across tech, that has made it so that training on something new takes more work, and you really have to entice people to do so. It's a commentary on how strong the product is that we are on track to have the majority of our impression bought on the new product by the beginning of next year.  So now, like next week, that should take 1 to 1.5 years to go from 0 to a 100%, and it always starts with the enticing or more seductive phase where we're just trying to entice them to move over. And then the stragglers, there are some amounts that you always just have to flip the new one on, and you have a lot of confidence in order to do that -- in order to push people to do it.  And we're getting closer to that, much closer to that, just based on how strong the reception has been from the majority of our clients. As it related to the data marketplace in the measurement marketplace. And so, there have been a whole bunch of inefficiencies in the way that we price data. And when I say we, I mean the entire ad tech industry.  So the way that we price data, especially third-party data, has been bad. The way that we selected cheaper data has been bad. And it's largely because there hasn't been a good way to find the data. And so because of Unified ID, because of all the tools that we built in Solimar to make on-boarding a brand's first-party data easier, now it makes it easy for them to discover which data they should be buying.  So it's a little bit like if you're on Netflix and you've never watched anything before. Netflix has nothing to recommend for you. That's where we were in the data ecosystem 5 years ago. Now that everybody's watched a lot of shows, if you will, have used more data. our recommendation for what they should be buying is better than any recommendation engine for data, I think ever anywhere.  So that makes it possible for us to have the most robust third-party data ecosystem. As it relates to the measurement markets like it\u2019s highly related to what we're talking about with Walmart, where instead of doing what the walled gardens have done. And once again, it's really important that the way that we win against a walled garden.  And then especially, the way you went in CTV, is not to play the game the way the walled gardens have been playing, which is to grade your own homework. We want to make it possible for other people to determine what success looks like. And the brand then has an opportunity in a marketplace to say, this is the way that I want to grade my success.  So for instance, today using the Walmart DSP, that's built on top of our platform, they can decide to determine success is when I sell a product inside of a Walmart store, and then I can use that as a proxy for how I spend money on ads across everywhere else in the ecosystem. So whether that's leveraging Walmart data or not, that makes choices around reach and frequency and a whole bunch of other things way better.  But then we also have the benefit of saying we didn't determine success and we didn't write our own homework. We were just trying to do the right thing, leveraging the dataset of other companies that were selected by the brands and agencies themselves instead of us just doing it on our own.  You put all of those together, while it takes some work to integrate all that, win the hearts and minds, and develop an open Internet that is way more sophisticated than the one of the past, it is a way better Internet than one that's just held hostage or captives by walled garden.\nTim Nollen: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities. Your line is live. You may begin.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much, Natalie. Youssef Squali. So hey guys, congrats on a really strong performance there. So 2 questions from me. 1, Jeff, can you maybe speak to the level of adoption of UID2.0 particularly by brands. You've done a great job bringing on a lot of ad tech partners.  But you gave the example of Maiden, which was super helpful, thank you. But what are the gating factors do you guys bring on a lot more brands over time, which clearly is the Holy Grail? And then on 2022, just at a high level, what's the setup for Connected TV beyond some of the color that you've given?  Particularly, I'm thinking about accelerating the adoption in Europe. If you can maybe just quanti -- and in Asia in particular. And if you can update us on where you think current penetration of connected TV stands in U.S. versus Europe versus rest of world that will be super helpful. Thank you.\nJeff Green: So it relates to the scale of UID, so we have produced hundreds of millions of unique users inside of UID. And the growth rates are breaking records every. seemingly every week, I think we've mentioned in the prepared remarks that I think we broke our record something like 12 times in the quarter, just every week feels like we're hitting a new watermark and getting more and more users.  So the month-over-month gains being in triple-digits, while we're talking about billions of unified ID, it is just unbelievable. And as I've said before, the momentum around this initiative, there's nothing I've ever seen like it. The collaboration is phenomenal. The fact that we're collaborating with competitors across-the-board is fantastic. The fact that even world gardens are creating passed to pack this through, while it's encrypted, they may not necessarily consume it.  They are supporting customers so that they can use it if they want to. And then you've got infrastructure plays like Snowflake adopting it. That's important not necessarily because they share that same vision or have the same concern about an open Internet that we do. But it is because having a currency that makes it -- so they can activate data improves their value proposition.  So when you look at whether it's them or a LiveRamp or a Nielsen, and just all the Companies including all the agencies, with all of their data products and data companies that they bought, that -- making them interoperable has just created a tremendous amount of momentum. You are right to point out that we're entering the phase where it's really important for advertisers and publishers to adopt it.  What's fantastic with the case studies like the one we mentioned for made in is that we're proving the lift. Advertisers now know that if they onboard their first-party data using the unified ID, that they will get better results. It doesn't take long for other advertisers to say, \u201cOh wow, I need to do that too.\u201d  And if that weren't enough -- if the carrot weren't enough there is the stick that is in 2023 third-party cookies are expected to go away. These initiatives are the only way that they can put data to work. So with all of that -- similar to my opening remarks on just all the secular tailwinds, as well as all the ways that we're operating to grab land, it's a very similar phenomenon with UIDs.  There's a bunch of external forces that are pushing people to use this. And then there's a bunch of benefits and a bunch of things that we've created in the product itself that get us to that direction. I do want to underline that with unified ID, this is not a Trade Desk initiative anymore. While we may have instigated it, we've open-sourced it, we have lots of other companies, including other DSPs, that are using this.  This is bigger than us. This is something that we wanted to create as a currency to rave all boats, recognizing that the collective open Internet would be better for it, that even consumers, will be better for it. And arguably, especially consumers will be better for us because no have more centralized controls that they can take with them and they won't just be managing privacy settings from one walled garden to the next.  And especially when you only do that on a device that means that consumers would be forced to manage their privacy in a double-digit number of places and very few understand or can coordinate well enough to does that well. This will really create a better Internet for the consumer. On the second part of your question on expanding CTV to the rest of the world; so we've started with some phenomenal partnerships, all over the world.  And I'm really excited about some of those things that we talked about during the prepared remarks. One that I just want to underline is we have an expanded relationship with Peacock and you remember that Peacock has rights to NHL, has rights to the NFL, it has rights to the Olympics, and of course here in the UK to the English Premier League to say nothing of the other $30th billion of content that they have. So doing more partnerships like that, the content owners all over the world is the most important thing that we can continue to do. Because most of the major markets, we already have a starting point that has really strong, not dissimilar from what we did in retail but where we started with the biggest. We've done very similar things like that in CTV all around the world; we just have to keep doing more of it.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Justin Patterson at KeyBanc. Your line is live. You may begin.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you. Jeff, you're crossing the $1 billion revenue level this year and there\u2019s a clearly strong retention characteristic with this model. What does the Company need to do to get to $2 billion or even $5 billion of revenue over the next few years? And then as a follow-up to that, perhaps you could expand on the supply chain efficiency initiatives you're working on, and really how that can create opportunities for you going forward. Thank you.\nJeff Green: Thanks for the question. This might be the most important question for us as a Company. I'm always reminded of democracy and at the end of the movie Hoosiers, where they're talking about how we win this game, that smaller team from a smaller town, competing with teams that are much bigger than them in every way.  Is not dissimilar from what we're doing with some of the biggest companies intact and our related history of the world and the way I'd look at it as we cannot lose sight, just like that Locker Room speech in that movie but ignore the fans, ignore all the outside towards the -- and just play your game, do it the right way.  And this is essentially the same thing I'm saying to our team over and over again. If we just stick to what we do really well -- we continue to win in CTV. We continue to service our customers the way we have. We focus on the buy-side the way that we always have. We try to make the supply chain more efficient. We add more value than we extract.  If we keep doing all the same things that we've done for the last 10+ years, I think we're going to get from 1 to 5 billion ahead of anybody else playing the same game. So this is one of those, or it's not about trying to exploit the weaknesses of other companies. This is about us just focusing on fundamentals, protecting our culture, continuing to build tech the way that we have, focused on recruiting the best talent.  And if we do that, we'll be successful. So that's number 1. Number 2, I would say are we had to win in CTV. And so the good news isn't CTV is at that market around the world is perfectly fragmented. That not broken into so many pieces that you have to aggregate millions the way you would have to in websites or apps. Those new gravitate to markets and those have been very good to us.  But there is a way for us to integrate almost directly and create a more efficient supply chain in CTV more easily than we can in the rest of it. And then a quarter outside the U.S. So we've been investing out as U.S. heavily for a long time where our employees are 1/3 of our employee base outside the U.S. while our revenue is low teams. And that differential is because we're investing ahead.  Most of the open Internet competitors cannot afford to make those investments the way that we have, which is why we continue to win share. We're doing more and more to invest in those, and we're going to get better at winning more aggressively and growing more quickly there as the Open Internet led by CTV continues to move in our direction. As it relates to the supply chain.  I should mention Google a little bit here because as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, there has been just a lot of discussion around the complaint led by the Texas attorney general office. I just want to reiterate. Our strategy has always been to compete and prepare for the market to be fair and competitive.  That we expect that end-state that market always trend towards fair and competitive, and to whatever extends that the market currently is both inefficient and not competitive, we think it's going to move in that direction. It's already been moving in that direction at a macro level in the sense that Google's Ad Exchange used to be the very biggest exchange, it's not for us anymore.  It's not for the industry anymore. While they have really strong market share in DFP itself as it relates to their ad exchange. It's not the biggest and literally we've plugged in the hundreds of them all over the world. As a result, I believe Google needs us more than ever. And we are going to succeed regardless of any policy decisions that Google makes or not.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Laura Martin at Needham. Your line is live. You may begin.\nLaura Martin: Great results. Maybe 1 for you, Justin, then 1 for you, Blake. On shopper marketing which the Walmart -- you said that Walmart has started and you are negotiating with a lot of other people to join. How big -- this closing the loop feels like it is best practice. Do you feel, Jeff, that this closing the loop kind of shopper marketing could be bigger than your core business today at maturity?  That's the one for you, and then Blake, you were very careful to say the word \u201cnearly all verticals had grown in the quarter.\u201d So, I'm really intrigued by what didn't grow in the quarter and what percent of digital ad revenue would that represent, as it starts to return inevitably in 2022? Thanks guys.\nJeff Green: You got it. I think over time, the same way that I look at -- actually let me backup. I am constantly looking at the trillion-dollar TAM that is, traditional advertising. And just looking at all the different ways to slice that. For instance, the fact that 2/3 of that pie is outside the U.S. is part of the reason why we've just been obsessive about growing our business outside the U.S.  And we've invested ahead and we are ahead in lots of markets. The markets like India, which have huge potential for China which fastest-growing office in the world. Or all of our expansions that we highlighted in places like Italy and Taiwan. All of these are because we see growth potential to get to that other 2/3 of the pie and we would be silly to only focus on 1/3 of the pie.  Shopper Marketing is incremental to that, not all of that is captured in that $1 trillion, but it collectively is about a $200 billion TAM. So that is incremental, but at end-stage, I expect that to be --our share to be in -- as a percentage similar to our percentage of the $1 trillion pie. And so I don't expect it to ever surpass that business. We might win more than our share in that particular TAM just because closing the loop is the Holy Grail.  And because I think we're in a great position to continue to partner across all of retail. But I do think that our core business and the thing that we've been working at for the last 10 years will always be the lion's share of our spend, but we merely scratched the surface in both categories, is so early to tell because we're just a tiny, tiny spark of what we're yet to becoming.\nBlake Grayson: And then I'll follow up Jeff on the second question, Laura, with regards to verticals, the obvious one that showed pressure on a year-over-year basis, this quarter was the politics. So obviously that vertical was super high last year because of the elections and so you obviously see some pressure there. I would say the only other one that to call out and it's not a significant share of our mix.  We do see some volatility in the family and parenting vertical a bit. And so it was a little lower than normal for Q3, but nothing of major concern for us. And so those are the ones that move around that we see, and then there are others obviously, still that we believe there's opportunity still remaining, but political is the large negative year-over-year in Q3, which is expected.\nLaura Martin: Thanks very much. Congratulations.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Laura.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Zgutowicz at Rosenblatt Securities line is live. You may begin.\nUnidentified Participant: Thank you. Just a couple on UID. Jeff, you mentioned UID2 daily avails are now in the billions. I was wondering if you could share what percentage of the media that you've sold year-to-date was resolvable to those avails. And what you expect that media mix, to trend to in the first half and half of next year. And then I just had a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yes. As it relates to truth of the entire media chain, there's still a lot of work to be done for it to be present from publisher to every link in the chain to be available to the advertiser. The bigger thing right now is where it's available in the graph, if you will, where we view all the measurements.  And that is probably the most promising thing that's happened with UID to date, where if you combine device IDs + UID, that's sum is greater than UID -- I'm sorry -- than device IDs + cookies. So it's already creating more traction in that modeling or that graph than what we have before UID existed.  But there's still a lot of work to do and it just relates to the questions that I answered earlier, which is we especially need more advertisers and publishers to be connecting that throughout the entire chain. We expect the advertisers to start. And because they bring incremental dollars that then makes all the publishers connect. But the fact that we've gotten to literally billions creates incentive for both sides to do that now, and it's just implementation.  So the difficult part is not actually winning hearts and minds, it's just getting from winning hearts and minds throughout the entire organization to implementation, and that just takes time. So at this point, I believe it is just a matter of time before that happens.\nUnidentified Participant: And maybe just to follow my point in terms of implementation, just on the specific at large publishers. How many have committed to UID to-date and what might be holding them back particularly as you brought on more and more Ad Tech partners?  It would seem to me that you talked a lot about advertisers onboarding first party data, but isn't the large publisher more of the impetus to get UID, sort of off the ground. Just to appreciate that specifically; How many large publishers you have committed today? In sort of what we should be thinking about in terms of milestones in the first half of next year. Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yeah. So one of the things that we've done a lot of this just pushing inside of journalism. And so you might have seen some of the press releases, whether about BuzzFeed or whether that's Washington Post and the 300 local journalistic outlets that they support technologically or news week or there is just dozens and dozens of top 200 publishers who already been public about their support, let alone those who are implementing it behind the scenes. On NBC earlier.  They have been public about their interoperability that your idea as well, which by the way is all that matters is that their ideas are interoperable with our ID. You are right, though, that it is important for both advertisers and publishers to adopt UID in order for it to be successful. It does not matter which one goes first. There is this chicken and egg challenge.  If publishers go first, then advertisers are incentivized to quickly onboard their data so that they can leverage what the publishers are making available to them. If advertisers go first, then it's on publishers to quickly implement so that they can get higher CPM because advertisers are telling them if you can just help me connect my data to this, I will pay more for your inventory.  That is what we're seeing. If that efficacy goes up by 3x, the cost goes up by 1.5 to 2x, and everybody wins. And so it makes it very, very incentivizing for both publishers and advertisers to do that. And that's largely because we started in the middle with infrastructure where we get to big scale pretty quickly and that part we've already done. So there's strong incentive for both sides to act now and that's all working.\nUnidentified Participant: And just real quickly, is there an inflection point I guess just speaking to the milestone, Jeff? I've seen when you talk about implementation being a hurdle. Is there an inflection point where that implementation is no longer hurdle and we see X number of large clubs sign up in the first half of next year? Thanks.\nJeff Green: So it's just pointed out after the  to make the next question. But it's just pointed out in the sense that -- I believe we\u2019ve will. Already reached the inflection point where anybody who is not implementing UID is operating at a disadvantage to those who have. It's just a matter of doing the work to get it integrated.  And then, of course, these are big strategic decisions that have to be understood at least at some level, in multiple parts of nearly every organization. So that just takes some time in order to do the ramp up. But we already had so many users and it is such dominant currencies than any other currency should be interoperable adopt in order to get some benefit. It's not rational, not be interoperable with that. That point -- that inflection point has already passed.\nChris Toth: Thanks Mark. Getting there, we have time for one more question. .\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo. Your line is live. You may begin.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. I'll be quick to a thing that\u2019s throughout Adweek one was the benefits of using new idea across the web and CTV for universal frequency capping. So want to know if you could talk about how much the pain point that is for advertisers. And unpack that a bit. And then second one was also from Adweek and that was AMC Networks talking about how they partnered with you guys to enable programmatic, addressable ads in linear TV.  They call it a first, They're kind of wrapping and digital wrapper around linear impressions and then getting across the trends and then you guys to be filled. So how quickly are you seeing the evolution from that standpoint? Thanks.\nJeff Green: You . Thanks, Brian, for the question. Really appreciate it and I\u2019ll take the first one and then I'm actually joined here by our Chief Revenue Officer, Tim Sims, who will take the second part of the question and Tim guilt-free of course to add any color on the first part as well. I love the first part; I mean the second part is great as well because AMC has been just such a phenomenal partner.  But you're absolutely right. So one thing that has not been discussed enough is that nearly everything in CTV is consumed, on the other side or on the inside of a logging. So in other words, you are logged-in using an e-mail address to consume content that you have that you're watching on pretty much every app, on every operating system that you'd have. Whether it's Roku or Amazon or something else.  And because it's on the other side of the log in, there is this benefit to using a common currency across all of those. If you think about it from a consumer standpoint, more than ever, we are watching content on multiple apps, like 5 years ago, we mostly watched on Amazon and Netflix, and now we watch on lots of apps.  And the fastest growing have been AVOD out. So you now see in ad whether that's Peacock  are over or any of the others. There are adds being shown across all of them. Of course, an advertiser would like to control reach and frequency across all the apps and not just one. If they just do it one app at a time, they are going to waste money.  And that waste is totally unacceptable in connected TV because the costs are higher. As I as I mentioned in the repaired remarks, the costs initially were higher because of scarcity. That's unacceptable anymore. You all first have to be justified with increased efficacy. And then efficacy cannot be justified if you do not control reach and frequency universally. This is why Unified ID is so strategically important for us.  But it's also wise so strategically important for every major brand in the world, where as they are looking at CTV, the perfectly fragmented ecosystem, they are looking at that saying, \u201cI have to control reach and frequency centrally. And if I don't do that, I'm going to operate at a disadvantage and I'm going to waste money compared to what I did in linear.\" And given the increased cost of content, the content owners are equally interested in making ads more effective because you can't win by showing an ad load that is as dense as the one that we had in linear. So, whether you're a content owner, whether you're an advertiser, or whether you're the DSP like us, we all want universal reach and frequency, and the only way that that can be done is with a common currency like UID. Now, Tim, for the second part.\nBlake Grayson: great. Brian, thanks for the question on AMC, I'll just zoom out for a second in that one of the things that we're constantly striving to do on the CTV partnerships front is how do we continue to expand and grow the amount of available inventory in television. And one of the interesting things that came out in the AMC release is that that's exactly what we're doing here.  We're looking at a new, albeit small, but a new area where we can create more inventories and that is with addressable linear CTV or the television. What\u2019s really important to call out as a distinction here, is that this look exactly like what we are doing in CTV with all of our other partners, but in the linear feed. So this is an open RTP requests to The Trade Desk where we can make a decision on an impression by impression basis to deliver an ad back to AMC.  And it's unique and that's expanding into a new area television in linear, but the little to it -- to us, is exactly like connected television where we get a request and we're able to bid back in real time on linear television. It's really exciting early days, but it's a very exciting new corner of television that he made addressable and available platforms like The Trade Desk.  And the last thing I'll say on this is that one of the reasons that we're able to partner so well with folks like AMC and one of the reasons that we've been able to partner everywhere in the world is because of our objective place in the market. So whenever network like AMC or looking to try new things and it's a push the boundaries and test new areas of available inventory. They come to us first because of our objective point in the market. So it's an exciting thing to watch still early days, but definitely an interesting period where we're going to expand.\nBrian Fitzgerald: All right.\nChris Toth: Thank you, Brian. And thank you so much for everyone is being on the call today. We ran a few minutes of over what we normally do, but appreciate everyone's attendance. Thank you.\nJeff Green: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's event. You may disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day. Goodbye and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm here in Europe this week meeting with some of our colleagues, customers, and partners. And I'm thrilled to be joining you from our recently reopened London office. For Q3, I'm pleased to report that The Trade Desk had another very strong quarter. Revenue was $301 million, a 39% increase from a year ago. Once again, exceeding our own expectations.  Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections in Q3 of last year, our growth was about 47% from a year ago. This performance builds on our momentum year-to-date. I'd like to start by sharing five major highlights from this last quarter. First video, which excludes connected TV accounted for nearly 40% of our business.  Our highest ratio ever, and our CCB growth has not just here in the U.S. Like last quarter, CCB spend grew more rapidly in EMEA than any region in the world. The second in Q3, our international growth once again outpaced the domestic growth. A trend that we expect to continue over the long term. Internet expansion also continued at a strong pace. Third, the Walmart DSC recently launched, which is of course built on top of The Trade Desk platform.  It is early days, but we are starting to see test budgets from some of the largest brands in the world flows through the platform. And perhaps most exciting, these budgets are incremental. Fourth, unified ID continued its strong industry-wide momentum and is reaching critical scale in the market. And fifth, our mobile business continues to be resilient.  As we predicted, the most recent IOS changes have had no material impact on our business, and we expect that to remain the case. With that, I'd like to give you our perspective on the state of the market and then getting into a few ways in which we are innovating to drive growth in this market. I get asked every day about where this market is heading because the pandemic has changed everything, because it has massively adjusted the media and tech landscape.  It has accelerated the shift to TTV, it forced brand marketers to embrace data, and has driven a higher focus on real-time agility for everyone in our industry. I think this is an important backdrop to why we're doing so well and why our prospects are so bright for the future. And why I'm so optimistic about the future of the open Internet.  Just as a reminder, according to IDC, the total advertising market today is estimated to be at about $750 billion. In just a few years and is estimated to exceed 1 trillion though. And over time, I believe that nearly all advertising will be digital and nearly all of it will be executed programmatically. As that shift happens, accelerated by the pandemic.  Our commitment to the open Internet only intensifies everything we do in terms of our investments are engineering priorities, our partnerships, and our go-to-market model are design to create a better Internet. And we want the Internet that is open, privacy safe, and competitive, not one that's just owned by a few companies.  And as we work to advance the open Internet, we have a level of support from Ad agencies, advertisers, industry bodies, TV content owners, and the independent ad-tech that is unprecedented. We never thought that our vision would be shared by so many companies outside of our own Company. More than ever, companies and marketers are concerned about the Internet being fair and competitive.  And many of them are looking to us to help the Internet reach its potential. It's also in that context that many people in recent weeks have asked about our response to the unredacted version of the antitrust complaint against Google filed by a multi-state coalition led by the Texas Attorney General.  Of course, the majority of the complaint alleges, among other things, that Google has engaged in unfair and anti-competitive conduct using this market power built on top of DFP, which is Google ad serving product per publishers. I expect that Google will take steps to make the market fair given the scrutiny that they are under. Well, that would be a positive development for the industry, as well as good for The Trade Desk.  I want to remind everyone that we have been we are and we expect to continue to do very well regardless of Google's policy choices. A very small percentage of our business runs through Google's ad exchange and we're not dependent on Google for our business. The bottom-line for us, is that the market will always ultimately gravitate to transparency and competition over time.  And we will continue to innovate to drive the industry in that direction, and to deliver more value to our advertising customers. And if we get that right, and I believe we are as you can see in our performance, we will grab more share of ad spend. To that end, I'm obsessed with the supply chain. The healthier the supply chains, the more competitive and transparent the Open Internet will be, certainly in contrast to wealth gardens.  Of course, we only serve the buy-side and that will never change, but serving the buy-side demand that we do our part, working with the industry, to make sure the supply chain is as efficient as possible so that everyone in the ecosystem provides more value than they extract. And we are innovating in the supply chain in ways that are not always obvious.  In the last few months, for example, we've been working with the supply side to further reduce the duplication of ad inventory. Because publishers use multiple supply side platforms or SSPs, we often have access to the same inventory from multiple sources. We've asked those SSPs to put in place a solution that identifies duplicative inventory so that we ensure bidding on the right impression at the right time, all the time.  There has been an overwhelming support and adoption for this approach as that increases the overall efficiency of supply chain. In the same vein, I also want to address the future of identity for the open Internet. UID is setting new benchmarks every week and every month. The growth is phenomenal. As I've said before, I've never seen the industry come together like this around a common agenda, collaborating on new technology that benefits all participants.  The daily avails on our platform with UID reached an all-time high just last week having broken record dozens of times through August, September, and October. The scale we have been able to build in a relatively short amount of time has been outstanding. And it's thanks to unprecedented industry-wide commitment and collaboration.  Everyone in the open Internet is aware that Google has announced that they intend to get rid of third-party cookies in 2023. I maintain that this is a strategic mistake for Google to do that, but their policy changes have created collaboration among the open Internet, that probably wouldn't have happened otherwise.  When fully implemented, we believe UID creates a better Internet for consumers with higher standards for consumer privacy than anything possible with cookies. And the momentum and adoption of UID2 underscores that. Even some of the walled gardens are passing an encrypted version of UID2 in their marketplaces and ecosystems.  But one amazing new milestone is that many of the largest advertisers on our platform are now transacting on UID2, or are in the process of implementing it. As you'd imagine, some of these are among the biggest advertisers in the world, and nearly all of the major ad agencies and holding companies like Omnicom prove versus  IPG, and even independent agencies like Horizon have also adopted UID2.  And the case studies are just starting to roll in because a common currency makes it easier for our brand to use first-party data than cookies ever could. They are using that data more often and more safely. One early case study is with maiden made in one of the fastest-growing cookware companies in the U.S. They are using UID2, the new industry identity currency in their campaigns and seeing the amazing results.  They have seen a 20% improvement in cost per acquisition. Not just that, but they're seeing their time to convert per user improved by 33% compared to when they don't use UID2. That means they're driving campaign precision and putting their advertising dollar to work as hard as possible. As a reminder, UID2 started with us, but it belongs to the Internet today.  It is open source and being used around the world and across many functions of the Internet, from payment companies, to cloud companies, to beverage companies, to agencies, to exchanges. New ideas, making the open Internet more effective. Meanwhile, CTV is expanding the open Internet in new ways.  Since March of 2020, everything has changed about TV. The move to CTV over that time has been the fastest secular shift we've seen at The Trade Desk ever before, the pandemic CTV was getting premium CPMs because of scarcity of AVOD inventory. Now AVOD inventory is growing rapidly and premiums require improvements in efficacy. That means advertisers need an objective platform more than ever.  A platform that does not own content or its own content channel. A platform that helps advertisers decides what to buy objectively while managing reach and frequency. And that's a major reason so much CTV demand is gravitating to The Trade Desk. Lastly, concerning the state of global advertising market today, roughly 2/3 of the total advertising market is outside of North America.  That's why we invest so heavily in key growth markets globally. In recent months, we've established a presence in markets like India, Italy, and the Nordics in Taiwan. And we're making very encouraging strides in every region where we are located. To wrap up our perspective on the state of the market, I'd like to circle back to where this all started from. I believe digital advertising is still a relatively young industry.  I got into this business initially because I thought there was a better way to price advertising that we could build something like the stock market or the markets for commodities, where there is transparency and -- of information and mechanisms that drive efficiency. Because these are the kinds of characteristics that any market demands. That any mature market creates overtime.  This approach remains central to our mission at The Trade Desk. We believe that an open, competitive market for digital advertising is the only way that we build long-term trust of marketers. It's how we unlocked that $1 trillion industry TAM. The bulk of which will be digital. But now, given all the opportunities created for us in this fast changing landscape, I'd like to talk about a few things that are driving us to win more shares during this unique moment in time.  On 77, we launched the biggest upgrade to our system ever. In terms of adoption we're exactly where we expect it to be. By the beginning of 2022, the majority of impressions on our platform will be bought via Solimar. Feedback from our customers has been very positive. They value the platform  the ability to be more granular in setting goals, and how Solimar activates on those goals.  Everything from campaign optimization to more meaningful measurement, just as important, the use of both precise goal setting and activation for first-party data has increased the ability of our AI to better optimize every campaign with data. Our goal is for advertisers who activate Solamar to utilize more data  and achieve measurable improvements in return on ad spend.  In doing so, that helps the advertising flywheel spin much faster. We're also getting very positive feedback from industry analysts. Gartner just released their Ad Tech Magic Quadrant for 2021. The Trade Desk continues to be a market leader scoring highest for completeness of vision. Perhaps more interesting though -- Gartner measures all participants across 4 critical capabilities.  The Trade Desk ranked number 1 for 3 of those: media planning, campaign piloting and campaign results analysis. Each of these is key elements of Solamar. When you consider that we're going up against some of the tech industry's heaviest hitters, such as Google and Amazon, it's pretty remarkable to be leading the pack in these categories. And that's credit to our amazing engineering and product teams and the work that they put into Solimar.  It also speaks to the focus we have on customer service. We're always looking to provide more value than we extract. But I think what's perhaps less well understood is the role that Solimar is plan and driving innovation for our customers and for the industry. Solimar is allowing us to advance ideas and efficiencies that are benefiting the entire digital advertising ecosystem. One of those areas is our measurement marketplace.  Instead of only using our metrics, we've created an entire marketplace to measure success. Having this marketplace makes end-to-end measurement possible at unprecedented scale. And nowhere is this more apparent than in retail. You all know about the partnership with Walmart, which is now available to many of the world's largest advertisers. Major brands such as PepsiCo, are already active testing campaigns in the Walmart DSP.  Walmart is clearly a pioneer here. What they are doing is unleashing their shopper data so that advertisers can understand the relationship between their advertising tactic and actual in-store or e-commerce activity. We think about this and closing the loop. For many of our largest CPG advertisers, for example, the bulk of their products are still sold in physical stores.  If they run an ad for toothpaste, they can now get a much better sense of how that actually drove sales, thanks to in-store shopper data. This means that advertisers can be much more precise and agile in everything they do at every stage of the advertising funnel. Advertisers can understand the impact of their campaigns at a micro level in a particular region, a specific store or at different times of day.  They can also look at their impact across different channels; which ones are working and what kind of created. But it's not just Walmart. We are now working with many of the major retailers in the U.S. and many more around the world. They will each approach it in their own way but major retailers everywhere are looking to make the most of their own shopper data.  So that they can provide the same kind of closed loop measurement via our platform to the Bond side. And they are joining forces with us because they trust us. They know we don't compete with them, and they know they will retain control of their data. Similar to when an operating system is upgraded, there were many upgrades to key features on Solimar. One of those features is called predictive clearing.  What this means is that we use our data tools on our AI to predict the clearing price of first price option. Advertisers can then bid as close to the winning price as possible without overpaying. With Solimar's upgraded predictive clearing, we've massively upgraded the product to use AI to help our customers save collectively tens of millions of dollars.  That's because this upgrade allows us to be much more aggressive in bidding and budget management, significantly lowering CPMs and increasing an advertiser's return on ad spend. We're seeing predictive clearing improvements resulting in the reduction of CPMs across-the-board of customers that have activated this feature thanks to the Solimar upgrade.  These kinds of efficiencies are important to all of our customers but they are particularly attractive to the brand marketers who are increasingly paying attention to programmatic and to efficacy. One long term effect of the COVID pandemic is that there is more pressure than ever, on brand marketers to show ROI for their marketing investments. And to show how their campaigns are driving business growth.  As a result, brand marketers are putting a premium on data and measurability. And Solimar is proving to be tremendously beneficial here. One area where we're making a great deal of progress. Is new ways of thinking about the marketplace for data, and how Solimar ensures we surface the right data at the right price? Of course, our customers have always used data to drive their campaigns.  But the market for that data has not always been efficient. Advertisers would have a sense of what kind of data they want to apply, say, ad group, or Geo-location, and they would go find the data for the campaigns in a fairly analog way. With Solimar, the process of finding the right data for each impression is way more automated.  Because of more first-party data usage and more precise school studying in Solimar, our AI tools automatically find the right data for each impression that our platform is bidding on. What that also means though, is that Solimar may surface many more points of data that are relevant and valuable to a campaign and its goals. If an advertiser has been using 2 or 3 data points up yesterday on Solimar, they will be using more.  As a result of more data, the ad impression is much more enriched. Is more valuable and precise and drives better return on ad spend. The last I would like to touch on is our continued growth in CTV. I spoke to -- at an event a few weeks ago called Media and Montage. Because COVID, it was actually held in the tenth in Manhattan. And a few of you may have actually been there. The event brought together many of the leaders of the media industry.  And there were some fascinating discussions around the future of TV. I noted that when I commented, as I have before, that linear or cable TV, is a ticking time bomb. And soon everyone will consume content via CTV. There was much more agreement than in years past. The notion that TV is moving to the Internet, is not nearly as controversial as it was 2 years ago.  And clearly not lost on the industry with COVID has accelerated the consumer shift to digital streaming platforms. I think perhaps what maybe a little less appreciated are the scale, the speed, and the permanent of that shift. It's happening fast. In terms of scale, we've already reached receiving point. Today, we reached more U.S. households via CTV than via traditional linear TV.  But the point about speed was really driven home at the Adweek conference, a couple of weeks ago. Our Chief Revenue Officer, Tim Sims was onstage with brand leaders at Anheuser -Busch, Volkswagen, and Colgate Palmolive. And unprompted those advertisers said they believe that the majority of TV advertising will be executed programmatically on CTV within 3 years.  It was a fascinating insight into the future of TV that's worth a lot of replay if you want to understand where this industry is headed. Pre -pandemic, we have much longer sense of the time horizon for that kind of transformation. But changing consumer habits have accelerated everything so that we have access to the best and broadest portfolio of premium CTV inventory, both here and around the world. Nowhere is that more apparent than in live sports.  For a long time, many TV industry insiders felt that live sports would be the tent pole that would prop up linear TV. But once again, consumers have voted, and they are switching to digital platforms to watch their favorite teams. We added the NDA lead past package from Turner Sports to our CTV inventory listed season. Viewership on this platform increased around 50% last season.  And their head of digital strategy, Seth Latesty, believes that digital viewers are much more leaned in, to quote him directly. The digital audience we see tends to be stickier because they are really seeking out the content specifically, there are deeper engagements versus someone sitting back on the couch and watching it.  E-marketer estimates that there are almost 60 million digital sports viewers in the U.S. right now, rising to more than 90 million over the next 3 years. The notion that live sports will save linear TV is fanciful. Which is why so many broadcasters are pivoting rapidly? The number of impressions we see for the NFL, for example, is up almost 6-fold this year.  We're also very excited that we've recently added a Peacock, which in addition to amazing original content, also both premium live sports franchises such as the NFL, the English Premier league and of course, the Olympics. As you can see our results, demand for CTV continues to outpace all other channels for inside and outside North America. I don't see that trend changing for the foreseeable future.  Video is the most effective way to reach consumers heart to mind. And advertisers are following the TV audience to new digital platforms. At the same time, content providers are working with us directly so that we have access to premium CTV inventory at scale. I'd like to wrap this up by bringing this back for the market opportunity. The total advertising industry is moving rapidly towards that $1 trillion.  The bulk of that will be digital and marketers are embracing data-driven decisioning more aggressively than ever; our long-term investments have positioned the Company to capture this opportunity in the years ahead. Solimar and is an innovation platform that is creating new value for advertisers because of how it unleashes data and drives greater return on ad spend.  UID2 is becoming a more widely used identity currency across the entire global open Internet and we continue to invest so that we can lead in CTV, the fastest-growing channel and digital advertising. Consumers are driving advertisers and TV content providers to rethink the future of TV, and that's going to be data-driven. These are our priorities because this is how we see the industry evolving.  I hear the same things in every customer conversation I have, regardless of industry or geography. And that's why more of the world's leading advertisers are standardizing on our platform and our retention rate remains over 95%. It's why the major holding companies are embracing UID2. I am why Walmart is partnering with us as they unlease their retail data. It's why SSPs are working with us to optimize the supply chain.  I could not be more excited about our growth prospects as we close out this year and head in to 2022 and beyond. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Blake before moving Q&A. Blake? So first of all Shyam, thank you for wishing us congratulations as well as just the question. I'm really excited about '22. I don't know that I've gone into a year more excited than I am going into '22. Apart of kinds things that are happening outside of our control. So the first is that the regulatory environment is actually really net positive.  So if Google and Facebook are a little bit more controlled or maybe forced to make more deliberate decisions or what's even more likely is that they go a little bit slower, that's a net positive for us given how much they've gained share over the years. Of course, things outside of us too changes in IOS and a lot of discussion this earnings season about supply chain challenges.  We don't see any material impact from IOS, and we don't see any material impact from supply chain. So if given that, it makes me even more excited about the things that are going really well. So first of all, we're consistently grabbing share. So just constantly getting more than the space is growing.  Second, we've never seen what's happening in CTV happen in any channel ever before. And I don't know if we'll ever see something like that happen again. But cord cutting, accelerating, I mentioned that cable subscriptions are a bit of a ticking time bomb. If that weren't enough results of subscription fatigue in live sports, returning the upfront last year was a little bit of a struggle.  We anticipate that that's going to create more and more opportunity for CTV and stock market, which is always programmatic. And then here on -- I'm in London. Just what's happening here in the UK as well as across the EMEA in CTV has incredibly developed. Then across the world in international detained CTV is growing faster than in the U.S. That's not enough Shopper Marketing is going incredibly well. We just went live with the largest retailers. In the world, which is creating closed loop measurement and that's the first of what I predict to be many to come like that. In '22, we have a midterm elections, which we think there has been some forecasts that basically the spend in digital will be the same as the presidential election year. So we think that macro estimation is good for us as well. And then we just shipped a new product and Solimar. So that's going incredibly well, which I'm sure we'll talk more about. And then UID it just going incredibly well. So everything is going great. To just give 30 seconds on the seasonality before I -- like answer. In general, the market was heading towards digital being always-on. And so there's less of a ramp and a difference between Q1 to Q4 where there was this ramp that was caused by seasonality. And there's just an always on mindset inside of digital, which should it changes everything. But before 2020, we were heading toward, what we predict it to be 4555, where 45% of the spend is in the first half of the year and 55% is in the back half of the year.  It's really important to note that 2020 because of global pandemic changed all of that. It's such an anomaly. 2021 is a little bit more normal, but both of those are anomalies, given just all the changes in the world and we expect '22 to be a bit more normal. But I'm sure Blake has more to say about that. You're there Vasily? Yeah. Thanks for the question Vasily. So, as it relates to the Walmart DFP, so it's always better to just start with the very biggest in the world. Just phenomenal that we were able to create this partnership in closing the loop with the biggest retailer in the world. But we're only a couple of weeks in. So of course, we're looking at as green shoots and the potential ahead of us.  That potential is obviously massive with sharper marketing being a $200 billion industry. When you look at what we're doing and spend and revenue, that's just a tiny, tiny percentage. Our entire Company is a tiny percentage of that shopper marketing TAM. We think, whereas eligible as anybody for that.  And that to me is the real hope of the Shopper Marketing and what we are demonstrating here with Walmart. Because still especially in the U.S., most purchases are still made offline, the fact that most of the -- the advertising spend is online, there is a deep need to bridge the gap, to connect the dots between those 2.  And what has been happening over the years is that retailers like Walmart, have tried to monetize their data by creating what we used to call ad networks, which are these little silos where they would sell their data on their own. To me, the most exciting thing is that the retailers are recognizing that in order to compete with Amazon, they have to put their data to work in a much bigger way.  And that is to close the loop so that instead of getting that $10 million from one of the biggest brands in the world who spend billions, to instead getting those big CPGs or soda companies or whatever, to optimize spending their billions, to selling product inside of those brick-and-mortar stores or even in their e-commerce efforts so that they're measuring all their marketing spend success by how they sell product in those stores.  So, for the first time ever I believe the retailers and the product owners are aligned in what they want, which is something much bigger. So because Walmart, the biggest, has gone first, it is not a surprise that all other retailers all over the world are saying we need to execute the same playbook, and we need to do more.  And so we're talking to dozens of retailers, all the names I suspect that you would predict. And when you look at that in totality, it is definitely one of the most bullish things that we're working on right now. And I'm really encouraged and excited and proud to be Walmart's partner. But I'm just equally excited about all the partnerships ahead for us. So first let me just say, we launched this product on 77 and so we're only in this about four months. The reception, especially given that it was our biggest release in the history of the Company has been unbelievable. Unbelievably strong and it's re-learning a new platform. So when you're -- when you're re-learning, especially in a year that has been as busy as this one, and especially with the talent shortages that exist inside of ad agencies and even brands.  And even to some extent across tech, that has made it so that training on something new takes more work, and you really have to entice people to do so. It's a commentary on how strong the product is that we are on track to have the majority of our impression bought on the new product by the beginning of next year.  So now, like next week, that should take 1 to 1.5 years to go from 0 to a 100%, and it always starts with the enticing or more seductive phase where we're just trying to entice them to move over. And then the stragglers, there are some amounts that you always just have to flip the new one on, and you have a lot of confidence in order to do that -- in order to push people to do it.  And we're getting closer to that, much closer to that, just based on how strong the reception has been from the majority of our clients. As it related to the data marketplace in the measurement marketplace. And so, there have been a whole bunch of inefficiencies in the way that we price data. And when I say we, I mean the entire ad tech industry.  So the way that we price data, especially third-party data, has been bad. The way that we selected cheaper data has been bad. And it's largely because there hasn't been a good way to find the data. And so because of Unified ID, because of all the tools that we built in Solimar to make on-boarding a brand's first-party data easier, now it makes it easy for them to discover which data they should be buying.  So it's a little bit like if you're on Netflix and you've never watched anything before. Netflix has nothing to recommend for you. That's where we were in the data ecosystem 5 years ago. Now that everybody's watched a lot of shows, if you will, have used more data. our recommendation for what they should be buying is better than any recommendation engine for data, I think ever anywhere.  So that makes it possible for us to have the most robust third-party data ecosystem. As it relates to the measurement markets like it's highly related to what we're talking about with Walmart, where instead of doing what the walled gardens have done. And once again, it's really important that the way that we win against a walled garden.  And then especially, the way you went in CTV, is not to play the game the way the walled gardens have been playing, which is to grade your own homework. We want to make it possible for other people to determine what success looks like. And the brand then has an opportunity in a marketplace to say, this is the way that I want to grade my success.  So for instance, today using the Walmart DSP, that's built on top of our platform, they can decide to determine success is when I sell a product inside of a Walmart store, and then I can use that as a proxy for how I spend money on ads across everywhere else in the ecosystem. So whether that's leveraging Walmart data or not, that makes choices around reach and frequency and a whole bunch of other things way better.  But then we also have the benefit of saying we didn't determine success and we didn't write our own homework. We were just trying to do the right thing, leveraging the dataset of other companies that were selected by the brands and agencies themselves instead of us just doing it on our own.  You put all of those together, while it takes some work to integrate all that, win the hearts and minds, and develop an open Internet that is way more sophisticated than the one of the past, it is a way better Internet than one that's just held hostage or captives by walled garden. So it relates to the scale of UID, so we have produced hundreds of millions of unique users inside of UID. And the growth rates are breaking records every. seemingly every week, I think we've mentioned in the prepared remarks that I think we broke our record something like 12 times in the quarter, just every week feels like we're hitting a new watermark and getting more and more users.  So the month-over-month gains being in triple-digits, while we're talking about billions of unified ID, it is just unbelievable. And as I've said before, the momentum around this initiative, there's nothing I've ever seen like it. The collaboration is phenomenal. The fact that we're collaborating with competitors across-the-board is fantastic. The fact that even world gardens are creating passed to pack this through, while it's encrypted, they may not necessarily consume it.  They are supporting customers so that they can use it if they want to. And then you've got infrastructure plays like Snowflake adopting it. That's important not necessarily because they share that same vision or have the same concern about an open Internet that we do. But it is because having a currency that makes it -- so they can activate data improves their value proposition.  So when you look at whether it's them or a LiveRamp or a Nielsen, and just all the Companies including all the agencies, with all of their data products and data companies that they bought, that -- making them interoperable has just created a tremendous amount of momentum. You are right to point out that we're entering the phase where it's really important for advertisers and publishers to adopt it.  What's fantastic with the case studies like the one we mentioned for made in is that we're proving the lift. Advertisers now know that if they onboard their first-party data using the unified ID, that they will get better results. It doesn't take long for other advertisers to say, \u201cOh wow, I need to do that too.\u201d  And if that weren't enough -- if the carrot weren't enough there is the stick that is in 2023 third-party cookies are expected to go away. These initiatives are the only way that they can put data to work. So with all of that -- similar to my opening remarks on just all the secular tailwinds, as well as all the ways that we're operating to grab land, it's a very similar phenomenon with UIDs.  There's a bunch of external forces that are pushing people to use this. And then there's a bunch of benefits and a bunch of things that we've created in the product itself that get us to that direction. I do want to underline that with unified ID, this is not a Trade Desk initiative anymore. While we may have instigated it, we've open-sourced it, we have lots of other companies, including other DSPs, that are using this.  This is bigger than us. This is something that we wanted to create as a currency to rave all boats, recognizing that the collective open Internet would be better for it, that even consumers, will be better for it. And arguably, especially consumers will be better for us because no have more centralized controls that they can take with them and they won't just be managing privacy settings from one walled garden to the next.  And especially when you only do that on a device that means that consumers would be forced to manage their privacy in a double-digit number of places and very few understand or can coordinate well enough to does that well. This will really create a better Internet for the consumer. On the second part of your question on expanding CTV to the rest of the world; so we've started with some phenomenal partnerships, all over the world.  And I'm really excited about some of those things that we talked about during the prepared remarks. One that I just want to underline is we have an expanded relationship with Peacock and you remember that Peacock has rights to NHL, has rights to the NFL, it has rights to the Olympics, and of course here in the UK to the English Premier League to say nothing of the other $30th billion of content that they have. So doing more partnerships like that, the content owners all over the world is the most important thing that we can continue to do. Because most of the major markets, we already have a starting point that has really strong, not dissimilar from what we did in retail but where we started with the biggest. We've done very similar things like that in CTV all around the world; we just have to keep doing more of it. Thanks for the question. This might be the most important question for us as a Company. I'm always reminded of democracy and at the end of the movie Hoosiers, where they're talking about how we win this game, that smaller team from a smaller town, competing with teams that are much bigger than them in every way.  Is not dissimilar from what we're doing with some of the biggest companies intact and our related history of the world and the way I'd look at it as we cannot lose sight, just like that Locker Room speech in that movie but ignore the fans, ignore all the outside towards the -- and just play your game, do it the right way.  And this is essentially the same thing I'm saying to our team over and over again. If we just stick to what we do really well -- we continue to win in CTV. We continue to service our customers the way we have. We focus on the buy-side the way that we always have. We try to make the supply chain more efficient. We add more value than we extract.  If we keep doing all the same things that we've done for the last 10+ years, I think we're going to get from 1 to 5 billion ahead of anybody else playing the same game. So this is one of those, or it's not about trying to exploit the weaknesses of other companies. This is about us just focusing on fundamentals, protecting our culture, continuing to build tech the way that we have, focused on recruiting the best talent.  And if we do that, we'll be successful. So that's number 1. Number 2, I would say are we had to win in CTV. And so the good news isn't CTV is at that market around the world is perfectly fragmented. That not broken into so many pieces that you have to aggregate millions the way you would have to in websites or apps. Those new gravitate to markets and those have been very good to us.  But there is a way for us to integrate almost directly and create a more efficient supply chain in CTV more easily than we can in the rest of it. And then a quarter outside the U.S. So we've been investing out as U.S. heavily for a long time where our employees are 1/3 of our employee base outside the U.S. while our revenue is low teams. And that differential is because we're investing ahead.  Most of the open Internet competitors cannot afford to make those investments the way that we have, which is why we continue to win share. We're doing more and more to invest in those, and we're going to get better at winning more aggressively and growing more quickly there as the Open Internet led by CTV continues to move in our direction. As it relates to the supply chain.  I should mention Google a little bit here because as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, there has been just a lot of discussion around the complaint led by the Texas attorney general office. I just want to reiterate. Our strategy has always been to compete and prepare for the market to be fair and competitive.  That we expect that end-state that market always trend towards fair and competitive, and to whatever extends that the market currently is both inefficient and not competitive, we think it's going to move in that direction. It's already been moving in that direction at a macro level in the sense that Google's Ad Exchange used to be the very biggest exchange, it's not for us anymore.  It's not for the industry anymore. While they have really strong market share in DFP itself as it relates to their ad exchange. It's not the biggest and literally we've plugged in the hundreds of them all over the world. As a result, I believe Google needs us more than ever. And we are going to succeed regardless of any policy decisions that Google makes or not. You got it. I think over time, the same way that I look at -- actually let me backup. I am constantly looking at the trillion-dollar TAM that is, traditional advertising. And just looking at all the different ways to slice that. For instance, the fact that 2/3 of that pie is outside the U.S. is part of the reason why we've just been obsessive about growing our business outside the U.S.  And we've invested ahead and we are ahead in lots of markets. The markets like India, which have huge potential for China which fastest-growing office in the world. Or all of our expansions that we highlighted in places like Italy and Taiwan. All of these are because we see growth potential to get to that other 2/3 of the pie and we would be silly to only focus on 1/3 of the pie.  Shopper Marketing is incremental to that, not all of that is captured in that $1 trillion, but it collectively is about a $200 billion TAM. So that is incremental, but at end-stage, I expect that to be --our share to be in -- as a percentage similar to our percentage of the $1 trillion pie. And so I don't expect it to ever surpass that business. We might win more than our share in that particular TAM just because closing the loop is the Holy Grail.  And because I think we're in a great position to continue to partner across all of retail. But I do think that our core business and the thing that we've been working at for the last 10 years will always be the lion's share of our spend, but we merely scratched the surface in both categories, is so early to tell because we're just a tiny, tiny spark of what we're yet to becoming. Thanks, Laura. Yes. As it relates to truth of the entire media chain, there's still a lot of work to be done for it to be present from publisher to every link in the chain to be available to the advertiser. The bigger thing right now is where it's available in the graph, if you will, where we view all the measurements.  And that is probably the most promising thing that's happened with UID to date, where if you combine device IDs + UID, that's sum is greater than UID -- I'm sorry -- than device IDs + cookies. So it's already creating more traction in that modeling or that graph than what we have before UID existed.  But there's still a lot of work to do and it just relates to the questions that I answered earlier, which is we especially need more advertisers and publishers to be connecting that throughout the entire chain. We expect the advertisers to start. And because they bring incremental dollars that then makes all the publishers connect. But the fact that we've gotten to literally billions creates incentive for both sides to do that now, and it's just implementation.  So the difficult part is not actually winning hearts and minds, it's just getting from winning hearts and minds throughout the entire organization to implementation, and that just takes time. So at this point, I believe it is just a matter of time before that happens. Yeah. So one of the things that we've done a lot of this just pushing inside of journalism. And so you might have seen some of the press releases, whether about BuzzFeed or whether that's Washington Post and the 300 local journalistic outlets that they support technologically or news week or there is just dozens and dozens of top 200 publishers who already been public about their support, let alone those who are implementing it behind the scenes. On NBC earlier.  They have been public about their interoperability that your idea as well, which by the way is all that matters is that their ideas are interoperable with our ID. You are right, though, that it is important for both advertisers and publishers to adopt UID in order for it to be successful. It does not matter which one goes first. There is this chicken and egg challenge.  If publishers go first, then advertisers are incentivized to quickly onboard their data so that they can leverage what the publishers are making available to them. If advertisers go first, then it's on publishers to quickly implement so that they can get higher CPM because advertisers are telling them if you can just help me connect my data to this, I will pay more for your inventory.  That is what we're seeing. If that efficacy goes up by 3x, the cost goes up by 1.5 to 2x, and everybody wins. And so it makes it very, very incentivizing for both publishers and advertisers to do that. And that's largely because we started in the middle with infrastructure where we get to big scale pretty quickly and that part we've already done. So there's strong incentive for both sides to act now and that's all working. So it's just pointed out after the  to make the next question. But it's just pointed out in the sense that -- I believe we've will. Already reached the inflection point where anybody who is not implementing UID is operating at a disadvantage to those who have. It's just a matter of doing the work to get it integrated.  And then, of course, these are big strategic decisions that have to be understood at least at some level, in multiple parts of nearly every organization. So that just takes some time in order to do the ramp up. But we already had so many users and it is such dominant currencies than any other currency should be interoperable adopt in order to get some benefit. It's not rational, not be interoperable with that. That point -- that inflection point has already passed. You . Thanks, Brian, for the question. Really appreciate it and I'll take the first one and then I'm actually joined here by our Chief Revenue Officer, Tim Sims, who will take the second part of the question and Tim guilt-free of course to add any color on the first part as well. I love the first part; I mean the second part is great as well because AMC has been just such a phenomenal partner.  But you're absolutely right. So one thing that has not been discussed enough is that nearly everything in CTV is consumed, on the other side or on the inside of a logging. So in other words, you are logged-in using an e-mail address to consume content that you have that you're watching on pretty much every app, on every operating system that you'd have. Whether it's Roku or Amazon or something else.  And because it's on the other side of the log in, there is this benefit to using a common currency across all of those. If you think about it from a consumer standpoint, more than ever, we are watching content on multiple apps, like 5 years ago, we mostly watched on Amazon and Netflix, and now we watch on lots of apps.  And the fastest growing have been AVOD out. So you now see in ad whether that's Peacock  are over or any of the others. There are adds being shown across all of them. Of course, an advertiser would like to control reach and frequency across all the apps and not just one. If they just do it one app at a time, they are going to waste money.  And that waste is totally unacceptable in connected TV because the costs are higher. As I as I mentioned in the repaired remarks, the costs initially were higher because of scarcity. That's unacceptable anymore. You all first have to be justified with increased efficacy. And then efficacy cannot be justified if you do not control reach and frequency universally. This is why Unified ID is so strategically important for us.  But it's also wise so strategically important for every major brand in the world, where as they are looking at CTV, the perfectly fragmented ecosystem, they are looking at that saying, \u201cI have to control reach and frequency centrally. And if I don't do that, I'm going to operate at a disadvantage and I'm going to waste money compared to what I did in linear.\" And given the increased cost of content, the content owners are equally interested in making ads more effective because you can't win by showing an ad load that is as dense as the one that we had in linear. So, whether you're a content owner, whether you're an advertiser, or whether you're the DSP like us, we all want universal reach and frequency, and the only way that that can be done is with a common currency like UID. Now, Tim, for the second part. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. As our financial performance in Q3 indicates, we continue to execute well in the current environment. Connected TV continued to be our fastest-growing channel at scale around the world. Solimar has ramping on plan. The Walmart DSP is now available, and as we have consistently stated, we have seen no material impact on our business from the recent IOS platform changes.  The value of our business model, being the largest independent DSP focused on the open Internet, continues to resonate strongly with our customers and has allowed us to build trust over the long term. Our appeal is the simplicity of our partnership. We focus exclusively on the buy-side, hunting for the impression opportunities that are the most valuable for our customers without the conflicts of owning inventory.  When we deliver value for customers on a campaign, they almost always, return for future ones, which have led to a retention rate of over 95% across the previous 7 years. Q3 was an incredibly strong quarter and a testament to our belief that advertisers are accelerating their shift to data-driven advertising in 2021, revenue of $301 million was up 39% from a year ago.  Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections last year, which represented a mid-single-digit percentage share of our business in Q3 of 2020, revenue increased approximately 47% year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from continued growth in the digital advertising environment from both agencies and brands. Our performance in Q3 was broad-based across all channels, regions, and nearly all verticals.  We continue to grow our top line quickly while scaling our cost structure efficiently, helping drive meaningfully positive EBITDA. In Q3, we generated $123 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 41% of revenue. During the quarter, our EBITDA continued to benefit from temporarily lower than expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment.  This includes items such as travel and live Company events that are very gradually starting to return to our core structure. From a scale channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter, aching Q3 video, which includes CTV and separately mobile, represented just about 40% each as a percentage share of our business. Video as a percent of our mix specifically continued to grow rapidly.  Similar to last quarter, the increase in video was driven by CTV. Display in audio represented about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented 88% and international represented 12% of our business for the quarter. APAC led our growth across all regions this quarter, Shanghai and Hong Kong drove spend growth in Northern APAC and Australia and Indonesia led our growth in southern APAC.  In terms of EMEA, London led the way nearly doubling year-over-year in Q3. As Jeff highlighted, CTV across EMEA was again, very strong, growing faster than any other region in Q3. CTV continues to rapidly increase its relative share of spend in Europe. While still small compared to the share of CTV spend produced in North America. We are optimistic about the trends we're seeing that set us up well for next year.  In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend; nearly all of them grew very nicely during the quarter. Travel, shopping, and home and garden were the strongest performers in Q3. We believe there's still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Operating expenses were $221 million in Q3, up 27% year-over-year.  The growths in operating expenses during the quarter were primarily driven by investments in our team, particularly in areas like technology and development, and sales and marketing. It is these areas that drive our business as we continue to scale for longer-term growth. During the quarter, we saw encouraging leverage from both our platform operations and G&A expenses as we scale the business.  Stock-based compensation expense increased 28% year-over-year. As expected, this marked a sharp deceleration from the first half of the year as expenses related to the Company's employee stock purchase plan moderated significantly. Income tax was approximately $20 million for the quarter, representing a tax rate of about 25%. Adjusted net income for the quarter was 89 million or $0.18 per fully diluted share.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $130 million, and free cash flow was $103 million in Q3. A strong cash-generation during the quarter was driven predominantly by our operating results. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis.  DSOs exiting Q3 were 87 days down 14 days from a year ago. DPOs were 73 days down 9 days from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $799 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet.  Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $388 million, which represent growth of 21% on a year-over-year basis, excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a high single-digit percent of spend that we've benefited from in Q4 of 2020. Our estimated growth rate in Q4 this year will be about 33% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $175 million in Q4. And finally, we anticipate our stock-based compensation to rise in Q4 from our normal run rate. This is being driven by approximately 95 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense we expect to include in Q4 related to a long-term CEO performance award granted on October 6th. The performance option has a grant date, fair value of 819 million in stock-based compensation.  Which is expected to be included in our G and A expense over approximately five years? The total amount expense is unrelated to weather any of the Performance Award thresholds are ever met. The only shares that have met the threshold criteria outlined in the performance plan are factored into our total shares outstanding.  In closing, we are pleased with the momentum of our business with large growth drivers such as CTV, our international business, our shopper marketing opportunity, which just kicked off with the Walmart DSP a few weeks ago, and our recent platform upgrade in Solimar. We remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond.  I believe we have the structure in place to continue driving long-term growth while scaling our business efficiently. I am cautiously optimistic about continued improvement in the future. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let's open up the call for questions. Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. Just to reiterate what Jeff said, I think the sequential growth seasonality; it's obviously changed a bit, over the last 18 months or so, during dealing with the impacts of COVID.  I do believe we seem to move closer back to that normal historic seasonality trend, but it's still a little bit early difficult to say exactly where the new normal seasonality ends up, but it does feel like we're getting back on that more normal historical trend. Thanks, John. Thank you, Jeff. And then I'll follow up Jeff on the second question, Laura, with regards to verticals, the obvious one that showed pressure on a year-over-year basis, this quarter was the politics. So obviously that vertical was super high last year because of the elections and so you obviously see some pressure there. I would say the only other one that to call out and it's not a significant share of our mix.  We do see some volatility in the family and parenting vertical a bit. And so it was a little lower than normal for Q3, but nothing of major concern for us. And so those are the ones that move around that we see, and then there are others obviously, still that we believe there's opportunity still remaining, but political is the large negative year-over-year in Q3, which is expected. great. Brian, thanks for the question on AMC, I'll just zoom out for a second in that one of the things that we're constantly striving to do on the CTV partnerships front is how do we continue to expand and grow the amount of available inventory in television. And one of the interesting things that came out in the AMC release is that that's exactly what we're doing here.  We're looking at a new, albeit small, but a new area where we can create more inventories and that is with addressable linear CTV or the television. What's really important to call out as a distinction here, is that this look exactly like what we are doing in CTV with all of our other partners, but in the linear feed. So this is an open RTP requests to The Trade Desk where we can make a decision on an impression by impression basis to deliver an ad back to AMC.  And it's unique and that's expanding into a new area television in linear, but the little to it -- to us, is exactly like connected television where we get a request and we're able to bid back in real time on linear television. It's really exciting early days, but it's a very exciting new corner of television that he made addressable and available platforms like The Trade Desk.  And the last thing I'll say on this is that one of the reasons that we're able to partner so well with folks like AMC and one of the reasons that we've been able to partner everywhere in the world is because of our objective place in the market. So whenever network like AMC or looking to try new things and it's a push the boundaries and test new areas of available inventory. They come to us first because of our objective point in the market. So it's an exciting thing to watch still early days, but definitely an interesting period where we're going to expand."

At this time all participants have been placed on listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President of Investor Relations at The Trade Desk. Sir, the floor is yours.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations are subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. I'm pleased to report that The Trade Desk had a very strong second quarter this year. Our revenue was up 101% from a year ago to $280 million, significantly surpassing our own expectations. Our growth was across all channels and speaks to our position as the leading DSP for the open internet. More of the world's top advertisers and their agencies signed up or expanded their use of our platform, which just continues to validate our business strategy. They are increasingly embracing the opportunities of the open internet in contrast to the limitations of Walled Gardens. Our performance this quarter and year-to-date has led by CTV and premium video. The move from broadcast and cable to digital on-demand content is happening all over the world. While each major media market and nation has different dynamics impacting the adoption rates, every major market in the world is heading towards consumption of premium TV and movie content over the internet. Because of our products, including our new platform, Solimar, our objectivity and market shifts, CTV as a percentage of our business continues to grow very rapidly and is by far our fastest growing channel. Heading into the pandemic, our CTV growth had been driven by our leading position in the U.S. and Australia, and we continue to enjoy outsized growth in these markets. But now we're starting to see our CTV strategy scale more broadly around the world. For example, our CTV revenue in Europe was up more than tenfold in the second quarter. I'll expand on this in a moment, but I could not be more optimistic about our CTV business. Overall, we fired on all cylinders in the second quarter in large part because we realized the value of the investments we have made in our business over the last few years. Just as important, these investments leave us very strongly positioned for growth moving forward and of course we continue to invest. Our latest platform launch, Solimar, is the result of more than two years of engineering work and it addresses many of the opportunities in front of agencies and brands today. I'll touch on this in a minute too. In order to provide some more color on these results and our optimism for the future, I'd like to focus on three key areas. First is our strength in CTV. Even as our overall business doubled over the second quarter last year, our CTV business significantly outpaced that growth and I'd like to spend a moment on the various factors driving our progress there. Second, I want to touch on how major advertisers are thinking about the value of the open internet in contrast to the limitations of Walled Gardens, especially in terms of how they think about identity, first-party data and performance measurement. And third, I'd like to focus on international growth like last quarter our international growth outpaced North America and we are seeing some trend lines that give me great optimism for the years ahead, so first CTV. Just to provide some context on our growth in CTV through just the first half of this year, the number of brands spending more than $1 million in CTV on our platform has already more than doubled year-over-year. And it's not just larger advertisers that are taking advantage of CTV anymore. The number of advertisers spending over $100,000 has also doubled. In total, we have nearly 10,000 CTV advertisers on our platform, up over 50% compared to last year. Large and medium sized advertisers alike are turning to us as the objective DSP for all digital media, but especially CTV and premium video. That exponential growth speaks to how rapidly the TV landscape is evolving. We've spoken before about the accelerated consumer shift to digital video, including CTV, and that shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, we have reached more households via CTV in the U.S. today than our reachable through linear TV. Today we reached more than 87 million households. Those trends are now well established. What is perhaps a little less appreciated is what's happening on the inventory side of TV and how advertiser demand for that inventory is also fueling the shift to CTV. In Q1 and Q2 of 2020, nearly every major advertiser had to pause or rethink their advertising campaigns due to the global pandemic, some adjusted in weeks, some took months, some are still adjusting, some companies grew faster because of the pandemic and, of course, some companies are still below their growth and revenue levels pre-pandemic. Many companies such as CPGs and pharma companies have enjoyed significant growth in that one year. They were able to adapt their businesses, pivot their message and appeal to consumers as their lives were upended and changed. Others such as those in the hotel, crews and airline industries have been largely treading water because of the various new restrictions we've all been living with. But regardless of where a company is on the growth spectrum, we're seeing the same response today. Those companies that enjoyed accelerated growth now need to market effectively to sustain that growth. Those that were struggling and hit the pause button are now playing catch up aggressively marketing to make up for lost time. Advertising and marketing matters more than ever in the formula for business success. The demand for growth, regardless of where a company is on the recovery curve has major implications for advertising. Brands are looking to their CMOs to find value in advertising that can help fuel new growth. The only way to find advertising efficiency in this market is with objective data-driven technology. And within that context, CTV offers some of the most effective advertising in the history of this space. The combination of moving picture, sound and data creates effectiveness and value that are unprecedented. We have significant premium CTV inventory at scale via our platform and partnerships as CTV growth moves to AVOD instead of the SVOD models that powered early adoption in the category. Indeed MoffettNathanson recently reported that the ad supported video on-demand market is growing from $4.4 billion in 2020 to about $18 billion as early as 2025 and every major ad supported platform, whether it's Disney, Hulu, Peacock. Discovery Plus, ViacomCBS' Paramount and Pluto, FOX's Tubi or FuboTV and many others all are reporting record viewership or ad spend figures and we see the rapid growth in AVOD in our CTV spend every quarter. The shift from legacy CTV to connected TV was especially apparent in this year's upfronts, which wrapped up in the second quarter. For the first time in the history of this annual process, every major broadcaster included programmatic packages and there is a wide range of reasons for that not least because CTV represents a greater percentage of their revenue than ever before. But perhaps most important, broadcasters recognized that the traditional upfront process is a mismatch. It doesn\u2019t work in a digital world where data and personalization are required to succeed. The legacy upfront process is really hard to run in an environment with lots of change and lots of uncertainty. I believe that this year will mark a turning point in how the process is managed. In today\u2019s fragmented TV environment linear audiences continue to erode, linear supply is shrinking and the prices are rising simply because of the scarcity. This year, broadcasters used that scarcity to their advantage and lock up commitments as the demand for growth intensified. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to predict who will watch, which show or which live sports event, which means linear viewership commitments are harder to make and stand by. Advertisers will then have a rethink and then seek out greater value in a data-driven spot market and a data-driven forward market for digital than the opacity and uncertainty of the legacy upfront market. They\u2019ll take budget back. They\u2019ll demand a new conversation next year and broadcasters are adapting by making CTV and programmatic a more significant part of the process. That conversation will also look at how to evolve the traditional focus on high gross rating points or GRPs. In the chase for high GRPs many advertisers are finding that they are under reaching some percentage of their target audience and way over reaching others more than ever. The average may be in their target range, but the actual consumer experience at the edges is highly inefficient. On the extreme lower-reside brands are actually paying to make consumers dislike them, showing the same ad over and over again to the same person. On the under-reside, showing the ad so rarely that it isn\u2019t noticed or even remembered. As a result, more advertisers are demanding that the data-driven agility of CTV become a larger component of the overall TV ad spend. That includes more measurement precision. GRPs become less important in a digital environment when you can have a direct interaction with the viewer and more precise measurement. For example, we recently worked with Ford to help build a CTV campaign that directly targeted households that were in market for a new car. That\u2019s very different from the traditional mass market linear TV campaign, where there\u2019s a great deal of waste. It\u2019s precision marketing using custom audience tools that identify when a consumer is coming off a lease or buying a car for the very first time. With CTV, Ford can then reach that audience with ads that are relevant to the time and place that the ads are being consumed. This level of marketing precision is simply not possible on linear or broadcast television. Just as important in this equation is a large and growing CTV footprint. When you combine premium quality data and inventory scale, CTV becomes a very compelling proposition for advertisers and their agencies. In that same work with Ford, we found that 48% of the households reach were incremental to anything addressable through linear. That means if you\u2019re limiting yourself to linear, you\u2019re missing out on almost half of your potential target market. It was the same story with large pharma and a medical device company. When compared to parallel linear TV ad campaigns, CTV delivered a 51% incremental reach and a 4x improvement when analyzing cost per household reach. These are not isolated cases. We are seeing many brands shift TV budgets to the data-driven precision of CTV. And I expect this trend to accelerate through the next years up fronts. One major global food company is working with us to shift almost a quarter of its TV budget to CTV by next year, so that they can better manage targeting the frequency. A global entertainment brand is doubling down on CTV with us because it allows them to measure the full customer journey from exposure to purchase. And a major telco is enjoying measurable sales lift by shifting a significant portion of its TV budget to decisioned-CTV on our platform. The evolution of TV advertising is a great barometer for the advertising industry overall. More and more brands want to be able to apply data to optimize their CTV and premium video advertising, they want to be able to measure campaign performance across all channels, they are focused on the quality of the TV supply chain and they want to ensure that their partners, including The Trade Desk are delivering more value than they are extracting. We proved this in the U.S. and we\u2019re seeing markets around the world have all similarly. And I still believe we are merely at the very beginning of the CTV innovation cycle. I can\u2019t put it any better than Jonathan Halvorson, Vice President of Consumer Experience at the global food giant Mondelez. Speaking last week with [indiscernible] he said, and I quote \u201cI\u2019ve been positively surprised by the advancements that The Trade Desk and other partners in CTV have made versus digital platforms. Their focus on advertisers needs for advanced targeting, inventory management and guarantees are setting them apart from YouTube and the rest of the marketplace.\u201d One last point on CTV. As the TV ecosystem gets more crowded and competitive, our strategic focus on objectivity is more valuable than ever. Some platforms that claim to be open and then primarily push their own content will lose favor with other content owners as the market progresses. We have great partnerships with content owners, because we bring them objective demand from our customers and we do not compete with them. We deliberately don\u2019t own or favor content. This also brings me to my second point because CTV is also highly indicative of how advertisers are increasingly embracing the open Internet, both as an alternative to walled gardens and as a part of their digital media plans. And I noticed this in various dimensions. If you notice some of the recent deals that we\u2019ve signed and talked about publicly, some of the world\u2019s largest advertisers have signed new contracts with us in recent weeks and months, increasing and extending their commitment to our platform. We\u2019re just scratching the surface and demand for our platform is growing across industries around the world. And as these brands work with us, they are making a commitment to the open Internet. This may be summed up by something that Arun Kumar, Chief Data Officer at IPG said at an Ad Week event with me a couple of weeks ago, he talked about how brands had relationships with consumers long before the major walled garden platforms came along and how those brands are working harder than ever to preserve those direct relationships, even as platforms try to disintermediate them. He believes there\u2019s so much collaborative innovation going on to support the open internet precisely for this reason. What he\u2019s also getting at there is a point that I think is often misunderstood about the motivations of brand advertisers. Most brands have decades long relationships with their consumers, these relationships have been nurtured and curated carefully over a wide range of interactions, including long-term loyalty programs. In many cases, consumers volunteer preference information in return for some kind of value. Given the effort that they put into this over many years, brands have no interest in jeopardizing the trust they have established with their customers. Brands want to provide a relevant and enjoyable advertising experience that respects their relationship with customers. And that experience is best managed and delivered across the open internet, where the advertiser has more insight and flexibility. In addition to managing their existing customer relationships for the long-term brands also want to find the next-generation of customers who share some of the same characteristics as their most loyal ones. And that in a nutshell is why their first-party data is so important. Brands know a lot about their most loyal customers, and they want to put some of that data to work, to find others like them, or ad impressions that their prospects are most likely to interact with. But unleashing the potential of that first-party data requires a few things. First, it must respect the privacy of the customer and preserve the trusted relationship between the advertiser and the consumer. Second, it has to be secure, not just from a data protection perspective, but also in terms of brands retaining control of their data. It must be easy. You have to have simple integrations and on-ramps. And then lastly, they put their first party data to work. Brands have to get some metric performance data back. They have to know whether it's working and how their prospects are reacting. Each of these requirements is challenging in a walled garden. None more so than the asymmetrical data relationship, any data, brand puts into a walled garden is often usable by that platform too. As media owners, they will put that data to work to their own benefit, as well as the advertisers. And the advertiser won't get the same grain of data back on their campaign performance. They'll get a report card saying that the campaign was successful, which is a bit like writing your own homework. But the results they get won't be the same kind of information that the brand can use to continue to refine their campaigns. And that's like quarter-after-quarter brands are gravitating to our plans and to the open internet. Walled gardens may provide easy access to scale. You can reach a lot of people very quickly, but they don't provide the precision and decisioning that are becoming so vital to today's marketer. And they don't provide much clarity on what content the brand is showing up against, what content they are, funding and supporting and how to refine their campaigns into the future. On July 7, we launched a new version of our platform Solimar, it is the biggest release in the history of the company and the reception has been fantastic. Again, it beat our own hopes and expectations and has great traction. At the current pace of adoption, by the beginning of next year, we expect the majority of the impressions on our platform to be bought using Solimar. A few of you joined us at our launch event in New York. And some of you joined the many thousands who watched online. I believe the remarkable interest in these events speaks to how rapidly our industry has evolved over the last 18 months and how Solimar is helping solve for many of the issues and opportunities in front of marketers today. Perhaps most important, with Solimar we believe we have created the industry's most advanced measurement marketplace. Not only can advertisers measure against traditional campaign performance metrics, but they can now integrate offsite measurement performance in a way that's only possible on the open internet. That means they can finally reached that holy grail of connecting their ad spend to actual business goals, whether it's in-store sales or foot traffic into a dealership or demand for tickets. Solimar has an ever-growing roster of third-party measurement data sources, including retailers who are eager to leverage the value of their shopper data so that they can and attract more advertising demand. But you don't get to build that kind of measurement marketplace without simple and secure data onboarding and without the ability of brands and partners to protect their data, to make sure it's only being used for the intended purposes. And you don't get to real performance measurement without the ability to enter more precise campaign goals and Solimar provides for all of that and much more. We launched Solimar at the time when UID2 is also reaching critical scale in the market. This is important because UID2 allows advertisers and partners to onboard their data in a manner that provides more consumer control and protects their data. In recent months, three of the major advertising holding companies Publicis, Omnicom and IPG have announced their support for UID2. In addition, many of the major independent agencies, such as Horizon are also now leveraging UID2. As well as the world's major agencies, many of the world's leading brands are also starting to use it. We're also working with many of the world's leading tech platforms, as they look at use cases for UID2. The publishing side is also embracing UID2. From a TTV perspective, major CTV industry, techs, consortiums, which are owned by the major networks, including Blockgraph and OpenAP are making their identifiers interoperable with UID2. That's an addition to networks such as AMC and fuboTV who are integrating directly and then traditional publishing groups, such as Maven, who own sports illustrated in the street.com and Newsweek have also embraced UID2. A couple of weeks ago, Snowflake announced that they would deploy UID2. This one is a little different, but very indicative of the scale that UID2 is achieving. Snowflake provides a cloud-based data service that sits on a company's cloud infrastructure and enables data to be managed across clouds. Snowflake acts as a hub for many companies\u2019 customer data, their first-party data, and that data can now be activated by using UID2 identifiers. What's really interesting about all this momentum around UID2, is that it has accelerated since Google announced that they would delay the deprecation of cookies by at least two years. You may remember that when Google first announced their intentions, I was somewhat skeptical and that's because the fundamental value exchange of the internet, free content in exchange for relevant advertising is not going to change. What will change is how we give consumers more information about that value exchange and how we provide better tools to payoff that exchange in a way that improves the experience for advertisers, publishers, and consumers, and gives consumers more control. That's what the industry has creating. UID2 is one leading example, but more important is the way that the industry is mobilizing to create a better approach to identity, one that reflects the fast moving cross-channel nature of today's digital advertising landscape. I cannot put this urgency any better than Joy Robbins, Chief Revenue Officer of the Washington Post Organization, who spoke at our recent Solimar event in New York City. The post as you may know, through a Zeus platform, also powers the ad tech stack for more than a hundred other publications across the U.S., including many days daily newspapers. So Joy's perspective is very insightful. To quote her directly, she said, \u201cWe need to make sure we're controlling our destiny. If we do nothing, we give our ad revenue stream to the walled gardens\u201d. It's that sentiment across the industry and around the world, that's driving so much collaborative innovation in support of the open internet. The last area that I want to touch on is our international growth. Once again, our international markets grew faster than the U.S. in the second quarter and this is particularly encouraging as this industry speeds towards $1 trillion TAM, about two-thirds of that will be outside the United States. And we are investing to capitalize on that international growth and serve a global advertiser customer base. Let me give just a couple of examples that put our investments and our growth into perspective. We started planting the seeds of Connected TV in Europe a few years ago, and we are now seeing the green shoots. CTV in Europe is still relatively early in its lifecycle compared to the United States. But with the exponential revenue growth, I mentioned earlier, it won't stay small for very long. In Europe, there is a significant consumer shift to streaming platforms, even for live sports. European broadcasters have developed their own streaming platforms, which is driving the inventory scale. That is so important to advertisers. For example, we're working with Sky, the largest media company in Europe, as they make their own content available over the internet. In fact, our partnership has significantly expanded this year. Sky has a huge presence in the UK, but they also enjoy strong market share across Europe. Like so many broadcasters today, Sky is also investing heavily in original content to attract new viewers. They are a dominant force in the European TV landscape and hold significant clout with brands and agencies there. Along with our existing partnership with Channel 4, as well as premium content providers in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, our relationship with Sky gives us access to the majority of CTV ad impressions across the continent. I want to, again, underline the significance of our objectivity in our inventory partnerships. As we expand around the world, because we don't own content. We are able to cleanly and clearly partner with the biggest content and broadcast companies around the world. Let me also spend a moment on APAC and one new market in particular, India. We've only recently opened an office in India earlier this year, but we have already made some incredible progress. It's worth reiterating how large this potential is. According to research by Global Web Index, Indians are spending an average of 8 hours a day online, most of it on the open internet, led by OTT content. These dynamics are fueling the rapid expansion of the digital advertising market in India expected to exceed $7 billion by 2024, up more than 10 fold since 2015. It's those same market dynamics that informed our premium video and CTV first approach to India. And this was somewhat atypical for us. In nearly every other market we have led with display. So as we opened in India, the first thing we did was strike important inventory partnerships in CTV. These included a deal with Samsung ads, which gives us access to inventory on Samsung Smart TV devices reaching 50 million highly coveted viewers. We also struck a partnership with Xiaomi, the world's largest smartphone manufacturer, bigger than even Apple. Xiaomi serves more than 10 billion ad impressions per day to those devices, all of which we have access too. In addition to device manufacturers, we've also established relationships with the leading content providers, such as Disney+ Hotstar, the leading OTT streaming service in India. And these partnerships are already yielding results. Brands, such as GSK are working with us in India to drive more data-driven precision in their ad campaigns, particularly with OTT content and seen significant performance improvements. Our initial progress in India is starting from a small base, but it has been very rapid. And over time we will build on these relationships and scale our business methodically just as we are doing across Asia and of course the rest of the world. All of this progress gives us a great deal of optimism for the quarters and years ahead, and this has just been a snapshot. In every market where we operate North America, AMEA and Asia and Australia, we are seeing significant growth that's because we continue to innovate more quickly and efficiently than others in our industry, whether it's the future of television, new approaches to identity or trading platforms that bring advertisers closer to the business results of their work, we are able to invest in the success of our advertising clients. We are not maximizing profit for the short-term. We have discipline around profitability so that we can invest for the future of our business and theirs. And this quarter, more than ever we can see how our prior investments can yield impressive results. And even as we make these investments, we are still generating EBITDA at rates, much higher than nearly all of our high growth software peers. And the second half of the year, we expect this approach to show more green shoots, as we expand our work in retail. Walmart will launch a new DSP, which integrates Walmart shopper data and is built on our platform. This is a leading example of how we are working with our advertising customers to help unlock the value of retail data, estimated at $100 billion to $200 billion market. Each retailer will approach this differently, but we are working with many of them, both here and around the world, but one position they do all share. They are all convinced that the value of their data is best realized on the open internet, not within the confines of the Walled Gardens. Our progress is also increasingly rooted in our ability to drive industry consensus around important issues that build overall trust in our industry. Our strategy will raise all boats. You are seeing that most clearly in the work we are doing around identity, but it's also present and how we approach the supply chain, fraud management, CTV scale, and many other areas. We remained convinced that the open internet is the best platform for our customers to achieve their marketing goals. And there's a large and growing coalition of advertisers, publishers, and partners who not only share that perspective, but who are actively working with us to realize it. All of that contributed to a great second quarter. We have very strong momentum and with these investments and the hard work of the Trade Desk employees around the world, I expect the wind to stay at our backs. And for that reason, as pleasing as the numbers are for the quarter, I am even more excited about the future growth prospects. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Blake, before moving to Q&A. Blake?\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, Q2 is a very strong quarter. Revenue of $280 million was up 101% from a year-ago. Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections last year, which represented a low-single-digit percentage share of our business in Q2 of 2020 revenue increased around 103% year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from continued improvement in the digital advertising environment from both agencies and brands. Growth was broad-based across all regions, channels and verticals. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a channel perspective. Our year-over-year revenue growth rates benefited from lapping slower growth related to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. With the continued strong top line performance in Q2, we generated $118 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 42% of revenue. EBITDA continues to benefit from temporarily lower than expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. This includes items such as travel and live company events that I've only just started to slowly resume. I'm proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate meaningfully positive EBITDA, while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that can drive our future growth. From a channel perspective: video, audio, and even display all more than doubled in Q2 from a year ago. Exiting Q2, mobile currently our largest channel represented a low-40s percentage share of our business. Video, which includes CTV, represented a high-30s percentage share of our business. Video as a percent of our mix continued to grow very rapidly. The increase in video is driven by CTV, which by a wide margin again, led our growth during the quarter. And finally display and audio represented about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented 87% of spend and international represented 13% as International's faster growth year-over-year resulted in a rising share of spend. In APAC, Shanghai and Hong Kong's spend growth were both very strong. In terms of our overall growth; Europe led the way growing well over 100% year-over-year in Q2. All of our offices in Europe, London, Hamburg, Paris, and Madrid should particularly strong growth. As Jeff highlighted, CTV drove our AMEA performance growing over 10 fold year-over-year. CTV, more than doubled its relative share of spend in Europe, while still small, relative to the share of CTV spend produced in North America we are optimistic about the trends we are seeing during the first half of 2021. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, the majority of them at least doubled during the quarter. Those verticals most impacted by COVID showed the most improvement overall, including travel, shopping and automotive. Home and garden, personal finance and food and drink were also very strong. We believe that there still a lot of recovery ahead of us in these segments and we can remain cautiously optimistic as we continue to see signs of improvement. Operating expenses for $218 million in Q2, up 41% year-over-year. The growth in operating expenses in the quarter was primarily driven by stock based compensation. Operating expenses, excluding stock based compensation grew 32% year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, the majority of the growth in stock-based compensation expense in the first half of the year was related to the company's employee stock purchase plan. Our growth and operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation on a year-over-year basis is influenced not only by lower expense growth in the prior year associated with impacts related to COVID, but also by continued investments in our team, particularly in areas like; sales and marketing, technology and development, and the team supporting that progress as we continue to scale for longer term growth. Income tax was $13.9 million for the quarter representing a tax rate of about 23%. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $88 million or $0.18 cents per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.4 million in Q2; this was driven by a change in working capital driven by strong sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact quarterly results. DSOs exiting in Q2 were 82 days, down 14 days from a year ago. DPOs were 67 days, down eight days from a year-ago, the resulting 15 day gap between DSOs and DPOs is the smallest in the company's history. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $705 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In June, we refinanced a new revolving credit facility and currently have $443 million available under the facility. In addition, we also executed a 10-for-one stock split. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter; we estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $282 million, which will represent growth of 30.5% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the U.S. political election spin, which represented a mid-single-digits percent of spend that we benefited from in Q3 2020 our estimated growth rate in Q3 of this year would be about 38% on a year-over-year basis. We estimated adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $100 million in Q3. In closing we're extremely pleased with our strong proponents in the quarter. We continue to execute and build on our solid foundation, and I could not be more excited about building on our progress in the second half of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Tim, your line is live.\nTim Nollen: Thanks very much. Jeff, I'd like to talk about CTV a bit more if I could. You mentioned your growth in Q2, I think you said significantly outpaced your overall growth. I wonder if you could comment about how that difference looks in the second half and even into next year, CTV versus overall Trade Desk growth. And also Q2, you talked about the upfront, Q2 was the quarter that the Upfront market occurred. So I'm intrigued by your comments on an eventual decline and the role that the Upfront will play for TV, or at least certainly for linear TV. My question is what did the Trade Desk do with advertisers and network groups in the Upfront? Or should we think really of your role more is helping expand the scatter market reaching all those incremental households that are otherwise slipping away from linear? And I guess the scatter market having been so strong going into the Upfront; I guess that's what must have supported your growth. So just want to understand how that continues from here? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Tim. So first on the macro related to CTV, so, on a year where nearly everything doubled year-over-year in this quarter-over-quarter basis. CTV once again led the way with massive growth in the quarter we just reported. We of course expect CTV to continue to drive our growth over the next couple of years and beyond as the leader \u2013 as it relates to channels in terms of what's happening across everything in digital, CTV as the lead for the open internet. I do believe Upfronts are driving more to CTV as well; I'll talk about that as I answer your second question in just a second. But one thing I want to highlight about CTV is that unlike any other channel, this is being driven by users. And so when programmatic first got started, it was because a bunch of B2B companies like ourselves wanted to create something more efficient for the internet. That's very different than the trend that's happening in CTV, which is users are moving from, from their cable subscriptions to the internet because it's better. It's on demand content is just a better way to consume. They can watch what they want, when they want, and that's something that can't be stopped. That's a secular tailwind that is going to benefit us, as far as I can see into the future. And then lastly on CTV trends, before I talk about the Upfront, there is a lot of subscription fatigue especially in SVOD. So what has happened over the last year or two, I think is fairly indicative of what most of us have experienced as individuals, which is we consumed most of our CTV content from Netflix or Amazon three or four years ago, and now today we have lots more choices, lots more channels that we're going to \u2013 we're asking questions like; is it on this channel or is it on that channel, a lot more often than we did before when we're logging into our CTV. And most of those incremental channels that we're adding are AVOD, so there's more and more inventory coming online. So one of the things that we're constantly saying to advertisers is whatever you thought you knew about scale and reach of CTV six months ago, well it's changed dramatically and that's underlined by the fact that we said 79 million households are reached on CTV, which is more than linear inside of linear or cable television. So CTV has an edge that it didn't have a year-ago. So I could go on and on, but I want to answer your question about Upfront. So this Upfront was really interesting in that the CPMs and the cost per unit went up because of scarcity. So despite the fact that you're reaching fewer people the price went up and so we think that puts a lot of pressure on the Upfront and then setting it up for some amount of under delivery. Most of the forecasts that were given to advertisers, I would say advertisers don't believe. They go into it skeptical and are saying we need to be prepared to be flexible, and in fact one of the large advertisers using our platform said, we are looking to go to an annual calendar and looking to take as much commitment out of the commitment as possible, essentially maximizing flexibility. I think that sort of summarizes what's happened, and so as a result, you're seeing people move into the scatter and spot market and we benefit tremendously from that. So right now you can \u2013 here's the Upfront market which is historically been a get together or a party, which is a relatively inefficient forward market. And then there's a spot market, and that has more and more moved to be a programmatic driven market. I think there is some insights to be gleaned from the ratings that were reported on the Olympics, which are of course down 45% over past Olympics. And, I don't think that's because NBC any wrong, it was just a question of discovery and just the nuance of the pandemic and whatnot. But that does make it so people are asking the question; what can I expect out of shows and this environment, and people are looking for more and more flexibility. And that may be just brings me to my last point, which is maybe at the very heart of your question, which is what role will we play in the Upfronts going forward? One of the biggest opportunities that our company has in its future is to play a central role in a more sophisticated forward market that replaces the Upfronts, where you can put data to work, and it's not an event or a party where everyone gets together, but it's an always on forward market that is data-driven and built on top of the spot market where people can make commitments and forecasting is better than it's ever been done in television, because the data is available. That's something that we're working very closely with some of the biggest names in TV and some of the biggest brands in the world, and some of the biggest agencies in the world to make certain that we upgrade the Upfronts, but that will make it so that programmatic is no longer primarily in the spot market, but it's also in the forward market.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research. Vasily, your line is live.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Good morning. So, Jeff, you had highlighted growth in connected TV outside of the U.S. Can you talk a little more about the growth you're seeing in Europe where, I think, you mentioned over tenfold rate of increases? And would you characterize this growth as an inflection point? Or I think it's just the low base effect? And as a follow-up, maybe you can talk about APAC a little more especially about the premium video and CTV growth that you highlighted. Maybe you can explain to us in a little more detail the difference between premium video, which I assume is mainly mobile and connected TV over there. Thank you very much.\nJeff Green: Absolutely, thank you. So maybe one of the most bullish numbers that we shared in this report is that CTV growth in EMEA grew 11x year-over-year, that number is really astounding and really surpass our own expectations. I think one way to characterize what's happened for us in CTV is to say The Trade Desk was leading in Australia and the United States going into the pandemic. And over the last 18 months or so, everything in the world has changed, consumption has changed. We had 3, 4, 5 years worth of change in television happened in that period of time. And so, what I say is one of the most bullish things that we've reported in this report or in this quarterly report is that it's because I do believe it those represent green shoots. I do believe it's the start of a change and where we were leading just in the U.S. and Australia we're now the seeing amazing results in Germany and the UK and Scandinavia and France and Spain. And we continue to maintain that all of it will eventually be traded programmatically or bought programmatically because that is a data-driven way that is more effective and it's the only way to preserve the amazing state of TV around the world, which is you get premium content, you see fewer and more relevant ads, and that creates a better user experience, which can fund more content. That virtuous cycle can only be perpetuated with a data-driven marketplace. And because that's just the math, that's just the way that it works. It's impossible for that not to take on everywhere around the world and we're seeing that play out now. As it relates to APAC, APAC is a little bit different in that \u2013 CTV is not always the place where premium content starts. That's much more common in the U.S., but because it is such a mobile region where mobile phones are often the place where content is \u2013 even premium content is consumed. You have to think of it as premium video TTV kind of in one bundle, especially in that market. But I think it's great to look at a case study. There's so many markets that we could report on, but because we just started in India this year, seeing this go into a market as big as ripe as India being the most populated country in the world, and then see us create partnerships in really a matter of months with Samsung Ads, Xiaomi, which has a huge presence in India and then Disney+, Hotstar to have those three content partnerships for premium content and to show ads on top of that in the most populated market in the world after only being there for months is indicative of just the momentum as well as how we continue to grab land around the world. So really optimistic about what I'm seeing around the world and kind of wins that our playbook that we've tested and proven in the U.S. and Australia is applicable to many other regions in the world.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Vasily.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Shyam Patel from Sig. Shyam, your line is live.\nShyam Patel: Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I had a couple of questions. The first one, Jeff, can you talk a little bit more about CTV and what you're seeing in Europe? It seems like it could be inflecting and maybe a few years behind the U.S., love your perspective on that. And then just a quick follow-up for Blake, I know you're not guiding beyond the third quarter. But when we look at 4Q, is there any color that you could offer just in terms of how to think about seasonality for revenue? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Yes. So, I'll just reiterate what I just said about CTV in EMEA. We had 11x growth year-over-year, which is one of the most bullish metrics that we've shared in this report. And we still feel like we're in early stages, but the green shoots that we're seeing I think are indicative of more to come and our partnerships in content around the world whether that's in London or Germany or Spain or Italy or France, are all indicative of great things to come. Blake on the second part.\nBlake Grayson: Sure and thanks for the question. I think, Shyam, I'll just talk a little bit about Q3 and then I'll try to address what I can on your question for the rest of the year in Q4. With Q3, there's so many positive trends and momentum in the Q2 and you've heard Jeff kind of highlights in those already. CTV is leading the way. The fundamentals of the business are really strong. The thing on Q3 is excluding political, which I would encourage people to think about as far as how to evaluate the underlying strength of the business on a year-over-year basis, we're showing significant acceleration year-on-year in Q3. I think that we're talking about excluding election Q3 of around 38% year-on-year and we were in the mid 20s for Q3 in the prior year, so really excited about that. As you think about and then moving on to the Q4, it does have more difficult comps than we see in Q3. You'll recall last year and we talked about this a couple of times, political breaths in Q4 last year was the biggest quarter that we had as a company was a high single-digit percent of our business, so really meaningful on a year-over-year basis. Also if you recall last year, Q4 is driven not just by that high single digit political span, but we also had a rebound in digital advertising as well, but I would just say regardless of the comps, there is so much momentum for us and the fundamentals of this business are so strong. I'm really optimistic about it.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Shyam.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Youssef, your line is live.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much and good morning guys. Congrats on the solid performance again. Two questions please. Jeff, maybe going back to Solimar, I know it's very early. I think you've only had it out for maybe about a month now. But just wondering if you can share any early feedback from clients, any improvement and campaign performance so far relative to next wave at least within those customers that have used it for a few weeks now and any impact so far on overall spend? Again I suspect not, but just wanted to ask. And then Blake, maybe the outperformance in the bottom line was particularly impressive. Can you maybe just walk us through the biggest contributors the bottom line beat, and what's non-repeatable as we go into second half of this year and early next year? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Yes. So, I'm really glad you've asked this question and I don't mind just being really open here, which is whenever you release a new \u2013 essentially a new platform, there's always some amount of anxiety you do as much research as possible, you test the market as much as possible, you listen as much as possible, and then you hope you got it right. And so we were really excited to ship Solimar, which is the biggest release in the history of the company. We had more engineering hours and people on this release than anything we've ever shipped ever. And to do most of that work during the pandemic where it's a little bit harder to do all those things like listen. I was anxious to see how it would be received of course optimistic and we were convinced we did the right thing, but you always want to see it in the numbers and that's exactly what we've seen. We've seen amazing traction. We're nearly a month in and the response has been fantastic. It does represent a behavior change though for the user, so they have to relearn something. But those that have taken the time to do it have all given us fantastic feedback that it is a better experience, which is exactly what we expected. And so, because it is a better experience that's why we're so optimistic that the majority of our ads will be bought on this new platform by the beginning of next year. And that represents more efficiency for the user. I'm especially excited about this going into Q4 because often what happens is Q4, as all of you know, is the biggest quarter of the year for us. But it's also where you prove yourself because much of the advertising spend is sort of determined by a calendar cycle, where in Q4 you spend the most, you performed the most. And then in Q1, you make a decision about where you\u2019re going to spend for the next year. And so if we have a really strong Q4, it sets up our Q1 really nicely for next year. And so I\u2019m optimistic that the performance will set us up for next year. So I couldn\u2019t be happier with the way Solimar has gone so far, it\u2019s very early as you highlighted, and it represents a behavioral change. But I\u2019m convinced that that\u2019s going to happen over time and really excited about what that means for efficacy on our platform.\nBlake Grayson: And then I\u2019ll just take the second part of that question on the beat on the bottom line for EBITDA. And so, more than half of the beat in the quarter on EBITDA was just really driven by the top line outperformance in the business. As many of you know, we don\u2019t have a lot of variable costs associated with higher top line. So when we see it come in flow is almost directly often down to EBITDA, so you see that. We did have some expense benefit as well. Some of that\u2019s timing, but it was broad-based, there wasn\u2019t anything like that I would major a call out. A little bit lower platform ops expense, a little bit of timing on some fixed marketing expense. We had better bad debt than expected a little bit because of continued health of the receivables, but nothing major though that I would call out.\nYoussef Squali: Great.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Laura Martin from Needham. Laura, your line is live.\nLaura Martin: Hey there. So Jeff, you were talking about how the CTV open internet consortium was integrating into 2.0, and then you said Fubo was integrating directly into 2.0. I was wondering how that affects your ability to target, whether people are going indirect, like an affiliating versus like Fubo directly integrated into 2.0? And then my second one is on the Walmart deal. Are we still on track to be fully integrated with Walmart by 4Q? And as \u2013 do you get paid on that because you get the 15% platform fee. Is that how you make money on the Walmart deal when CPG spends money on your platform? Thank you.\nJeff Green: You bet. Appreciate the question. So as many may know, one of the things that is really important about preserving the amazing state of CTV is to provide relevant ads on the shows that you\u2019re watching when it\u2019s ad funded. And because of the nature of devices in CTV, it requires a bit more collaboration between the content owners, as well as those providing that. And so what we\u2019ve needed, and many people talk about this in the context of cookies and browsing but that\u2019s not really what UID was designed for exclusively. It was designed to create a better currency for the entire internet, especially for a connected TV, so a content owner can have the same understanding of a user, pass that to those of us representing the advertisers. So that then we have a common understanding and can provide relevant advertising as well as make certain that we don\u2019t show the same ad five times in the same commercial break, make certain that we don\u2019t show them an ad that\u2019s irrelevant to them, and that makes them more effective. So all the TV companies have different ways of integrating with the Unified ID 2.0, some of them have gone to coalitions like Blockgraph or OpenAP and said, hey, you\u2019re a consortium and you\u2019re a technology consortium, so why don\u2019t you do the work for all of us? And there are others who have said, well, working in a consortium can take too long and we want to make certain that it integrates directly, and we have data that we want to put to work directly. And so from our standpoint, we\u2019re a indifferent, whether a consortium does the work, whether the content owners themselves do the work, many have put them on parallel paths, which is a commentary on how critically and strategically important it is for them and for us to get the IDs set up, so that we can provide those relevant ads. But Fubo moved to do it directly, to me is exciting because they could access that in another ways, but they want to make certain that they do it as quickly as possible. We expect that trend to continue just because the future of television is dependent on it. And then the second...\nBlake Grayson: Just Walmart.\nJeff Green: Yes, Walmart. So yes, Walmart is on track. We continue to have really fantastic discussions with them. As it relates to how we\u2019ll be paid, we\u2019re paid the same way that we would with any other partnership where we have our standard platform fees and then they put their data exclusively to work in this version of their DSP, which is of course built on top of our platform.\nLaura Martin: Thank you very much. Great numbers. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Matt Swanson from RBC Capital Markets. Matt, your line is live.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I\u2019ve got two as well. They\u2019re both going to kind of be follow-ups to Laura\u2019s a second ago now. I mean, great traction on UID 2.0 ads. You used the term critical scale. Could you just help us with a little more color on what you think of as far as what is critical scale in terms of if cookies went away tomorrow, what you think of the efficacy of the replacement? And if there\u2019s any way to think about endings or percentages of how far are you away from kind of the ideal state that would be really helpful. The other on the Walmart example, is it \u2013 are there ways that you can use this as kind of a POC, proof-of-concept for other retailers? I\u2019m sure with Amazon doing what they are with their DSP, it\u2019s becoming an increasing area of focus for other retailers who maybe don\u2019t have the internal tech platform that Amazon does. And it seems like that\u2019s a great place for Trade Desk to come in.\nJeff Green: Yes. So the term critical scale, you pulled out I think a very important phrase that we used in our prepared remarks in the earnings report, which I do think is indicative of the moment that we\u2019re in right now, as it relates to the way the internet is going to work. And then you asked about if cookies were to go away today. So to be clear, Google announced that they don\u2019t expect cookies to go away before 2023. And they said \u2013 and even then, we\u2019ll just \u2013 we\u2019ll see when we get there. So I\u2019ve been maintaining from the very beginning that I\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s in the best strategic interest for Google to get rid of cookies at all, but that\u2019s not what this was about. Creating UID was not about replacing cookies. It was about creating a better internet and that doesn\u2019t just apply to the browsing internet, which as everyone knows, that\u2019s a small minority of what the internet is. Of course, your mobile devices and the related apps, as well as things like connected TV, which is some of the most effective advertising, maybe the most effective advertising that\u2019s ever been done at scale, which is all dependent on different IDs. But when you get to a place where the currency is so widely accepted, it becomes critical to doing business. So think of it like Visa or Mastercard, a currency that if you do not accept that currency in your local store, you are going to struggle to get business. You might be able to say, I won\u2019t accept American Express or I might not accept Discovery, but there are some currencies like either cash or Visa or Mastercard that you have to accept in order to just keep the doors open. That\u2019s where I believe UID is at that inflection point where it\u2019s become so interoperable with other currencies that making certain that you\u2019re interoperable, if you\u2019re something new or if you\u2019re a TV company, you will be operating at a disadvantage if you are not interoperable with UID 2. So when I say it\u2019s a critical scale, that\u2019s what I mean, that inflection point where you can\u2019t afford not to be a part of it. As it relates to the \u2013 to retail proof-of-concept, it\u2019s always great to partner first with the biggest retailer in the world. And so \u2013 and naturally that creates a bit of a case study and it lays down the gauntlet for everybody else. That of course has been done. And it would be strategically suboptimal to say it nicely for us to not be working on bringing other retailers and their data into the platform. Especially because of what I talked about in the prepared remarks where, we're trying to help the open internet, be an amazing contrast to walls garden. And that means, especially in measurement and the way that results are created and measured and by making everything comparable to each other, you make it to the open internet. It's a much better place to spend the lion share of your dollars than in walled gardens, where everything is opaque, and you're totally dependent on them to tell you how you did. And so in that environment, it becomes really important, especially for companies that sell their products in-stores, to have insights about how that performed. And of course, they want to see how it performed at Walmart, but there's a bunch of other retailers or a bunch of other stores that they also want to see where it transacted and there's of course, a bunch of other data about transactions that would help them discover what is actually working. And that's what's really critical for the open internet, it's at a moment, where we can actually show what's working and what's not, which is critical given it so easy to make ads on the internet, there's ads everywhere, so, which ones are working is a question that has to be answered better than ever before, because of what's driving on it, which is economic growth and recovery.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from a Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Brian, your line is live.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, guys. I want to go back to Solimar and you talked about some new capabilities specifically around onboarding and measurement marketplace, just wondering if you could discuss the revenue opportunities and the mechanics around those as well. If the measure marketplace is that going to be a take rate model and will onboarding have a revenue component. And if so \u2013 is that going to be more volume than spend oriented, just some more on the mechanics?\nBlake Grayson: Yes. So both of those making it easier to onboard your first-party data, as well as making it easier to measure success, are not about making more money for us directly. I really like the Amazon metaphor of spinning the flywheel faster, and there are some activities that you do in your business to make it so that your core activity goes better, and that the value exchange is even more obvious so that your customers spend more, do more with you. So in both cases, onboarding first-party data and measurement marketplace. My idea was that they're both free. So there's not an incremental take rate for those exact features. But if you get more spend on the platform, you make more money. And if you produce better results, you get more spend and you make more money. And so I'm absolutely after making more on this, but not on those features directly by giving them away, we make efficacy on the platform better. We make the open internet better, and we get more of that spend. And that's the idea. There will be cases in the measurement marketplace where people do pay and that's good. It's kind of like paid apps on your iPhone or your Android versus free apps, both are important and having some amount of paid apps, so that they're really high quality and it create the most competitive marketplace possible are important. So some of them will be paid, but I think the default maybe similar to on your phone, should be for free because that creates more usage and creates the better experience.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Brian. And Paul, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: The final question will be coming from Justin Patterson from KeyBanc. Justin, your line is live.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much. Two, if I can first. Jeff, could you expand on the Snowflake UID integration? It sounds like something that could broaden your reach from large advertiser there. So that's question one. And then question two, you talked about efforts to simplify the supply chain, could you talk about what that entails and just how that creates new opportunities ahead? Thanks so much.\nJeff Green: You bet. So I really appreciate the question because I, I think Snowflake adopting UID2 is one of the biggest headlines that has happened for UID to date and not enough has been said about it. I don't think most people understand why this is so big. So first let just remind everyone that UID2 is no longer a Trade Desk product. We did most of the early developing, but it's owned by the community. We've worked together with the open internet. It's open source at this point. So it is way bigger than us. And some of the proof of that is adoption from companies like Snowflake. So if you don't know snowflake, what they do is they make it really easy for you to manage your data. So in the same way that Wix made it really easy for companies to build websites, Snowflake makes it really easy for companies to put their data to work. Now they're typically much bigger companies than those that Wix works with, but that's part of what makes it so exciting, is that \u2013 if they're trying to put data to work, they of course need to be leveraging the currencies that had scale. And so that makes it possible for that data to be more used and protected so that they can do the right thing by consumers, whether they're on the content side or whether they're on the advertiser side. So when a company who is so focused on making data actionable and listening to customer so that you can make certain that you're doing what they're asking for. The Snowflake using this just underscores just how much critical mass UID2 already have. And then as it relates to Solimar and its impact on the supply chain. What we have are spending a tremendous amount of time doing is trying to shed light on the supply chain. And what we're constantly asking, it is \u2013 our people in the supply chain adding more value than they extract. That's what we expect our own company to do. And that's what we expect everyone else in the supply chain to do. And then if that's not for us to decide on our own. But we do want to provide transparency so that the market can decide, especially because we represent so much demand. And so we are working night and day to make certain that we're shining the light of transparency on the supply chain, so that anyone in the supply chain, there\u2019s extracting more value chain, our charging more than the value they create, that they'd be removed from the ecosystem by the market, not by us so that the supply chain becomes more efficient. And the reason why this is so critical is, because the open market has to compete with walled gardens and one great, in some ways advantage wallet gardens have. Is that they have a shorter supply chain because they control it all. So we just need the market to do it same. And in order for it to do that, it needs transparency.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Justin, and thanks for everyone for joining the call today. Paul, I'll leave it with you to close it out.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. Have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. I'm pleased to report that The Trade Desk had a very strong second quarter this year. Our revenue was up 101% from a year ago to $280 million, significantly surpassing our own expectations. Our growth was across all channels and speaks to our position as the leading DSP for the open internet. More of the world's top advertisers and their agencies signed up or expanded their use of our platform, which just continues to validate our business strategy. They are increasingly embracing the opportunities of the open internet in contrast to the limitations of Walled Gardens. Our performance this quarter and year-to-date has led by CTV and premium video. The move from broadcast and cable to digital on-demand content is happening all over the world. While each major media market and nation has different dynamics impacting the adoption rates, every major market in the world is heading towards consumption of premium TV and movie content over the internet. Because of our products, including our new platform, Solimar, our objectivity and market shifts, CTV as a percentage of our business continues to grow very rapidly and is by far our fastest growing channel. Heading into the pandemic, our CTV growth had been driven by our leading position in the U.S. and Australia, and we continue to enjoy outsized growth in these markets. But now we're starting to see our CTV strategy scale more broadly around the world. For example, our CTV revenue in Europe was up more than tenfold in the second quarter. I'll expand on this in a moment, but I could not be more optimistic about our CTV business. Overall, we fired on all cylinders in the second quarter in large part because we realized the value of the investments we have made in our business over the last few years. Just as important, these investments leave us very strongly positioned for growth moving forward and of course we continue to invest. Our latest platform launch, Solimar, is the result of more than two years of engineering work and it addresses many of the opportunities in front of agencies and brands today. I'll touch on this in a minute too. In order to provide some more color on these results and our optimism for the future, I'd like to focus on three key areas. First is our strength in CTV. Even as our overall business doubled over the second quarter last year, our CTV business significantly outpaced that growth and I'd like to spend a moment on the various factors driving our progress there. Second, I want to touch on how major advertisers are thinking about the value of the open internet in contrast to the limitations of Walled Gardens, especially in terms of how they think about identity, first-party data and performance measurement. And third, I'd like to focus on international growth like last quarter our international growth outpaced North America and we are seeing some trend lines that give me great optimism for the years ahead, so first CTV. Just to provide some context on our growth in CTV through just the first half of this year, the number of brands spending more than $1 million in CTV on our platform has already more than doubled year-over-year. And it's not just larger advertisers that are taking advantage of CTV anymore. The number of advertisers spending over $100,000 has also doubled. In total, we have nearly 10,000 CTV advertisers on our platform, up over 50% compared to last year. Large and medium sized advertisers alike are turning to us as the objective DSP for all digital media, but especially CTV and premium video. That exponential growth speaks to how rapidly the TV landscape is evolving. We've spoken before about the accelerated consumer shift to digital video, including CTV, and that shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, we have reached more households via CTV in the U.S. today than our reachable through linear TV. Today we reached more than 87 million households. Those trends are now well established. What is perhaps a little less appreciated is what's happening on the inventory side of TV and how advertiser demand for that inventory is also fueling the shift to CTV. In Q1 and Q2 of 2020, nearly every major advertiser had to pause or rethink their advertising campaigns due to the global pandemic, some adjusted in weeks, some took months, some are still adjusting, some companies grew faster because of the pandemic and, of course, some companies are still below their growth and revenue levels pre-pandemic. Many companies such as CPGs and pharma companies have enjoyed significant growth in that one year. They were able to adapt their businesses, pivot their message and appeal to consumers as their lives were upended and changed. Others such as those in the hotel, crews and airline industries have been largely treading water because of the various new restrictions we've all been living with. But regardless of where a company is on the growth spectrum, we're seeing the same response today. Those companies that enjoyed accelerated growth now need to market effectively to sustain that growth. Those that were struggling and hit the pause button are now playing catch up aggressively marketing to make up for lost time. Advertising and marketing matters more than ever in the formula for business success. The demand for growth, regardless of where a company is on the recovery curve has major implications for advertising. Brands are looking to their CMOs to find value in advertising that can help fuel new growth. The only way to find advertising efficiency in this market is with objective data-driven technology. And within that context, CTV offers some of the most effective advertising in the history of this space. The combination of moving picture, sound and data creates effectiveness and value that are unprecedented. We have significant premium CTV inventory at scale via our platform and partnerships as CTV growth moves to AVOD instead of the SVOD models that powered early adoption in the category. Indeed MoffettNathanson recently reported that the ad supported video on-demand market is growing from $4.4 billion in 2020 to about $18 billion as early as 2025 and every major ad supported platform, whether it's Disney, Hulu, Peacock. Discovery Plus, ViacomCBS' Paramount and Pluto, FOX's Tubi or FuboTV and many others all are reporting record viewership or ad spend figures and we see the rapid growth in AVOD in our CTV spend every quarter. The shift from legacy CTV to connected TV was especially apparent in this year's upfronts, which wrapped up in the second quarter. For the first time in the history of this annual process, every major broadcaster included programmatic packages and there is a wide range of reasons for that not least because CTV represents a greater percentage of their revenue than ever before. But perhaps most important, broadcasters recognized that the traditional upfront process is a mismatch. It doesn't work in a digital world where data and personalization are required to succeed. The legacy upfront process is really hard to run in an environment with lots of change and lots of uncertainty. I believe that this year will mark a turning point in how the process is managed. In today's fragmented TV environment linear audiences continue to erode, linear supply is shrinking and the prices are rising simply because of the scarcity. This year, broadcasters used that scarcity to their advantage and lock up commitments as the demand for growth intensified. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to predict who will watch, which show or which live sports event, which means linear viewership commitments are harder to make and stand by. Advertisers will then have a rethink and then seek out greater value in a data-driven spot market and a data-driven forward market for digital than the opacity and uncertainty of the legacy upfront market. They'll take budget back. They'll demand a new conversation next year and broadcasters are adapting by making CTV and programmatic a more significant part of the process. That conversation will also look at how to evolve the traditional focus on high gross rating points or GRPs. In the chase for high GRPs many advertisers are finding that they are under reaching some percentage of their target audience and way over reaching others more than ever. The average may be in their target range, but the actual consumer experience at the edges is highly inefficient. On the extreme lower-reside brands are actually paying to make consumers dislike them, showing the same ad over and over again to the same person. On the under-reside, showing the ad so rarely that it isn't noticed or even remembered. As a result, more advertisers are demanding that the data-driven agility of CTV become a larger component of the overall TV ad spend. That includes more measurement precision. GRPs become less important in a digital environment when you can have a direct interaction with the viewer and more precise measurement. For example, we recently worked with Ford to help build a CTV campaign that directly targeted households that were in market for a new car. That's very different from the traditional mass market linear TV campaign, where there's a great deal of waste. It's precision marketing using custom audience tools that identify when a consumer is coming off a lease or buying a car for the very first time. With CTV, Ford can then reach that audience with ads that are relevant to the time and place that the ads are being consumed. This level of marketing precision is simply not possible on linear or broadcast television. Just as important in this equation is a large and growing CTV footprint. When you combine premium quality data and inventory scale, CTV becomes a very compelling proposition for advertisers and their agencies. In that same work with Ford, we found that 48% of the households reach were incremental to anything addressable through linear. That means if you're limiting yourself to linear, you're missing out on almost half of your potential target market. It was the same story with large pharma and a medical device company. When compared to parallel linear TV ad campaigns, CTV delivered a 51% incremental reach and a 4x improvement when analyzing cost per household reach. These are not isolated cases. We are seeing many brands shift TV budgets to the data-driven precision of CTV. And I expect this trend to accelerate through the next years up fronts. One major global food company is working with us to shift almost a quarter of its TV budget to CTV by next year, so that they can better manage targeting the frequency. A global entertainment brand is doubling down on CTV with us because it allows them to measure the full customer journey from exposure to purchase. And a major telco is enjoying measurable sales lift by shifting a significant portion of its TV budget to decisioned-CTV on our platform. The evolution of TV advertising is a great barometer for the advertising industry overall. More and more brands want to be able to apply data to optimize their CTV and premium video advertising, they want to be able to measure campaign performance across all channels, they are focused on the quality of the TV supply chain and they want to ensure that their partners, including The Trade Desk are delivering more value than they are extracting. We proved this in the U.S. and we're seeing markets around the world have all similarly. And I still believe we are merely at the very beginning of the CTV innovation cycle. I can't put it any better than Jonathan Halvorson, Vice President of Consumer Experience at the global food giant Mondelez. Speaking last week with [indiscernible] he said, and I quote \u201cI've been positively surprised by the advancements that The Trade Desk and other partners in CTV have made versus digital platforms. Their focus on advertisers needs for advanced targeting, inventory management and guarantees are setting them apart from YouTube and the rest of the marketplace.\u201d One last point on CTV. As the TV ecosystem gets more crowded and competitive, our strategic focus on objectivity is more valuable than ever. Some platforms that claim to be open and then primarily push their own content will lose favor with other content owners as the market progresses. We have great partnerships with content owners, because we bring them objective demand from our customers and we do not compete with them. We deliberately don't own or favor content. This also brings me to my second point because CTV is also highly indicative of how advertisers are increasingly embracing the open Internet, both as an alternative to walled gardens and as a part of their digital media plans. And I noticed this in various dimensions. If you notice some of the recent deals that we've signed and talked about publicly, some of the world's largest advertisers have signed new contracts with us in recent weeks and months, increasing and extending their commitment to our platform. We're just scratching the surface and demand for our platform is growing across industries around the world. And as these brands work with us, they are making a commitment to the open Internet. This may be summed up by something that Arun Kumar, Chief Data Officer at IPG said at an Ad Week event with me a couple of weeks ago, he talked about how brands had relationships with consumers long before the major walled garden platforms came along and how those brands are working harder than ever to preserve those direct relationships, even as platforms try to disintermediate them. He believes there's so much collaborative innovation going on to support the open internet precisely for this reason. What he's also getting at there is a point that I think is often misunderstood about the motivations of brand advertisers. Most brands have decades long relationships with their consumers, these relationships have been nurtured and curated carefully over a wide range of interactions, including long-term loyalty programs. In many cases, consumers volunteer preference information in return for some kind of value. Given the effort that they put into this over many years, brands have no interest in jeopardizing the trust they have established with their customers. Brands want to provide a relevant and enjoyable advertising experience that respects their relationship with customers. And that experience is best managed and delivered across the open internet, where the advertiser has more insight and flexibility. In addition to managing their existing customer relationships for the long-term brands also want to find the next-generation of customers who share some of the same characteristics as their most loyal ones. And that in a nutshell is why their first-party data is so important. Brands know a lot about their most loyal customers, and they want to put some of that data to work, to find others like them, or ad impressions that their prospects are most likely to interact with. But unleashing the potential of that first-party data requires a few things. First, it must respect the privacy of the customer and preserve the trusted relationship between the advertiser and the consumer. Second, it has to be secure, not just from a data protection perspective, but also in terms of brands retaining control of their data. It must be easy. You have to have simple integrations and on-ramps. And then lastly, they put their first party data to work. Brands have to get some metric performance data back. They have to know whether it's working and how their prospects are reacting. Each of these requirements is challenging in a walled garden. None more so than the asymmetrical data relationship, any data, brand puts into a walled garden is often usable by that platform too. As media owners, they will put that data to work to their own benefit, as well as the advertisers. And the advertiser won't get the same grain of data back on their campaign performance. They'll get a report card saying that the campaign was successful, which is a bit like writing your own homework. But the results they get won't be the same kind of information that the brand can use to continue to refine their campaigns. And that's like quarter-after-quarter brands are gravitating to our plans and to the open internet. Walled gardens may provide easy access to scale. You can reach a lot of people very quickly, but they don't provide the precision and decisioning that are becoming so vital to today's marketer. And they don't provide much clarity on what content the brand is showing up against, what content they are, funding and supporting and how to refine their campaigns into the future. On July 7, we launched a new version of our platform Solimar, it is the biggest release in the history of the company and the reception has been fantastic. Again, it beat our own hopes and expectations and has great traction. At the current pace of adoption, by the beginning of next year, we expect the majority of the impressions on our platform to be bought using Solimar. A few of you joined us at our launch event in New York. And some of you joined the many thousands who watched online. I believe the remarkable interest in these events speaks to how rapidly our industry has evolved over the last 18 months and how Solimar is helping solve for many of the issues and opportunities in front of marketers today. Perhaps most important, with Solimar we believe we have created the industry's most advanced measurement marketplace. Not only can advertisers measure against traditional campaign performance metrics, but they can now integrate offsite measurement performance in a way that's only possible on the open internet. That means they can finally reached that holy grail of connecting their ad spend to actual business goals, whether it's in-store sales or foot traffic into a dealership or demand for tickets. Solimar has an ever-growing roster of third-party measurement data sources, including retailers who are eager to leverage the value of their shopper data so that they can and attract more advertising demand. But you don't get to build that kind of measurement marketplace without simple and secure data onboarding and without the ability of brands and partners to protect their data, to make sure it's only being used for the intended purposes. And you don't get to real performance measurement without the ability to enter more precise campaign goals and Solimar provides for all of that and much more. We launched Solimar at the time when UID2 is also reaching critical scale in the market. This is important because UID2 allows advertisers and partners to onboard their data in a manner that provides more consumer control and protects their data. In recent months, three of the major advertising holding companies Publicis, Omnicom and IPG have announced their support for UID2. In addition, many of the major independent agencies, such as Horizon are also now leveraging UID2. As well as the world's major agencies, many of the world's leading brands are also starting to use it. We're also working with many of the world's leading tech platforms, as they look at use cases for UID2. The publishing side is also embracing UID2. From a TTV perspective, major CTV industry, techs, consortiums, which are owned by the major networks, including Blockgraph and OpenAP are making their identifiers interoperable with UID2. That's an addition to networks such as AMC and fuboTV who are integrating directly and then traditional publishing groups, such as Maven, who own sports illustrated in the street.com and Newsweek have also embraced UID2. A couple of weeks ago, Snowflake announced that they would deploy UID2. This one is a little different, but very indicative of the scale that UID2 is achieving. Snowflake provides a cloud-based data service that sits on a company's cloud infrastructure and enables data to be managed across clouds. Snowflake acts as a hub for many companies' customer data, their first-party data, and that data can now be activated by using UID2 identifiers. What's really interesting about all this momentum around UID2, is that it has accelerated since Google announced that they would delay the deprecation of cookies by at least two years. You may remember that when Google first announced their intentions, I was somewhat skeptical and that's because the fundamental value exchange of the internet, free content in exchange for relevant advertising is not going to change. What will change is how we give consumers more information about that value exchange and how we provide better tools to payoff that exchange in a way that improves the experience for advertisers, publishers, and consumers, and gives consumers more control. That's what the industry has creating. UID2 is one leading example, but more important is the way that the industry is mobilizing to create a better approach to identity, one that reflects the fast moving cross-channel nature of today's digital advertising landscape. I cannot put this urgency any better than Joy Robbins, Chief Revenue Officer of the Washington Post Organization, who spoke at our recent Solimar event in New York City. The post as you may know, through a Zeus platform, also powers the ad tech stack for more than a hundred other publications across the U.S., including many days daily newspapers. So Joy's perspective is very insightful. To quote her directly, she said, \u201cWe need to make sure we're controlling our destiny. If we do nothing, we give our ad revenue stream to the walled gardens\u201d. It's that sentiment across the industry and around the world, that's driving so much collaborative innovation in support of the open internet. The last area that I want to touch on is our international growth. Once again, our international markets grew faster than the U.S. in the second quarter and this is particularly encouraging as this industry speeds towards $1 trillion TAM, about two-thirds of that will be outside the United States. And we are investing to capitalize on that international growth and serve a global advertiser customer base. Let me give just a couple of examples that put our investments and our growth into perspective. We started planting the seeds of Connected TV in Europe a few years ago, and we are now seeing the green shoots. CTV in Europe is still relatively early in its lifecycle compared to the United States. But with the exponential revenue growth, I mentioned earlier, it won't stay small for very long. In Europe, there is a significant consumer shift to streaming platforms, even for live sports. European broadcasters have developed their own streaming platforms, which is driving the inventory scale. That is so important to advertisers. For example, we're working with Sky, the largest media company in Europe, as they make their own content available over the internet. In fact, our partnership has significantly expanded this year. Sky has a huge presence in the UK, but they also enjoy strong market share across Europe. Like so many broadcasters today, Sky is also investing heavily in original content to attract new viewers. They are a dominant force in the European TV landscape and hold significant clout with brands and agencies there. Along with our existing partnership with Channel 4, as well as premium content providers in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, our relationship with Sky gives us access to the majority of CTV ad impressions across the continent. I want to, again, underline the significance of our objectivity in our inventory partnerships. As we expand around the world, because we don't own content. We are able to cleanly and clearly partner with the biggest content and broadcast companies around the world. Let me also spend a moment on APAC and one new market in particular, India. We've only recently opened an office in India earlier this year, but we have already made some incredible progress. It's worth reiterating how large this potential is. According to research by Global Web Index, Indians are spending an average of 8 hours a day online, most of it on the open internet, led by OTT content. These dynamics are fueling the rapid expansion of the digital advertising market in India expected to exceed $7 billion by 2024, up more than 10 fold since 2015. It's those same market dynamics that informed our premium video and CTV first approach to India. And this was somewhat atypical for us. In nearly every other market we have led with display. So as we opened in India, the first thing we did was strike important inventory partnerships in CTV. These included a deal with Samsung ads, which gives us access to inventory on Samsung Smart TV devices reaching 50 million highly coveted viewers. We also struck a partnership with Xiaomi, the world's largest smartphone manufacturer, bigger than even Apple. Xiaomi serves more than 10 billion ad impressions per day to those devices, all of which we have access too. In addition to device manufacturers, we've also established relationships with the leading content providers, such as Disney+ Hotstar, the leading OTT streaming service in India. And these partnerships are already yielding results. Brands, such as GSK are working with us in India to drive more data-driven precision in their ad campaigns, particularly with OTT content and seen significant performance improvements. Our initial progress in India is starting from a small base, but it has been very rapid. And over time we will build on these relationships and scale our business methodically just as we are doing across Asia and of course the rest of the world. All of this progress gives us a great deal of optimism for the quarters and years ahead, and this has just been a snapshot. In every market where we operate North America, AMEA and Asia and Australia, we are seeing significant growth that's because we continue to innovate more quickly and efficiently than others in our industry, whether it's the future of television, new approaches to identity or trading platforms that bring advertisers closer to the business results of their work, we are able to invest in the success of our advertising clients. We are not maximizing profit for the short-term. We have discipline around profitability so that we can invest for the future of our business and theirs. And this quarter, more than ever we can see how our prior investments can yield impressive results. And even as we make these investments, we are still generating EBITDA at rates, much higher than nearly all of our high growth software peers. And the second half of the year, we expect this approach to show more green shoots, as we expand our work in retail. Walmart will launch a new DSP, which integrates Walmart shopper data and is built on our platform. This is a leading example of how we are working with our advertising customers to help unlock the value of retail data, estimated at $100 billion to $200 billion market. Each retailer will approach this differently, but we are working with many of them, both here and around the world, but one position they do all share. They are all convinced that the value of their data is best realized on the open internet, not within the confines of the Walled Gardens. Our progress is also increasingly rooted in our ability to drive industry consensus around important issues that build overall trust in our industry. Our strategy will raise all boats. You are seeing that most clearly in the work we are doing around identity, but it's also present and how we approach the supply chain, fraud management, CTV scale, and many other areas. We remained convinced that the open internet is the best platform for our customers to achieve their marketing goals. And there's a large and growing coalition of advertisers, publishers, and partners who not only share that perspective, but who are actively working with us to realize it. All of that contributed to a great second quarter. We have very strong momentum and with these investments and the hard work of the Trade Desk employees around the world, I expect the wind to stay at our backs. And for that reason, as pleasing as the numbers are for the quarter, I am even more excited about the future growth prospects. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Blake, before moving to Q&A. Blake? Thanks, Tim. So first on the macro related to CTV, so, on a year where nearly everything doubled year-over-year in this quarter-over-quarter basis. CTV once again led the way with massive growth in the quarter we just reported. We of course expect CTV to continue to drive our growth over the next couple of years and beyond as the leader \u2013 as it relates to channels in terms of what's happening across everything in digital, CTV as the lead for the open internet. I do believe Upfronts are driving more to CTV as well; I'll talk about that as I answer your second question in just a second. But one thing I want to highlight about CTV is that unlike any other channel, this is being driven by users. And so when programmatic first got started, it was because a bunch of B2B companies like ourselves wanted to create something more efficient for the internet. That's very different than the trend that's happening in CTV, which is users are moving from, from their cable subscriptions to the internet because it's better. It's on demand content is just a better way to consume. They can watch what they want, when they want, and that's something that can't be stopped. That's a secular tailwind that is going to benefit us, as far as I can see into the future. And then lastly on CTV trends, before I talk about the Upfront, there is a lot of subscription fatigue especially in SVOD. So what has happened over the last year or two, I think is fairly indicative of what most of us have experienced as individuals, which is we consumed most of our CTV content from Netflix or Amazon three or four years ago, and now today we have lots more choices, lots more channels that we're going to \u2013 we're asking questions like; is it on this channel or is it on that channel, a lot more often than we did before when we're logging into our CTV. And most of those incremental channels that we're adding are AVOD, so there's more and more inventory coming online. So one of the things that we're constantly saying to advertisers is whatever you thought you knew about scale and reach of CTV six months ago, well it's changed dramatically and that's underlined by the fact that we said 79 million households are reached on CTV, which is more than linear inside of linear or cable television. So CTV has an edge that it didn't have a year-ago. So I could go on and on, but I want to answer your question about Upfront. So this Upfront was really interesting in that the CPMs and the cost per unit went up because of scarcity. So despite the fact that you're reaching fewer people the price went up and so we think that puts a lot of pressure on the Upfront and then setting it up for some amount of under delivery. Most of the forecasts that were given to advertisers, I would say advertisers don't believe. They go into it skeptical and are saying we need to be prepared to be flexible, and in fact one of the large advertisers using our platform said, we are looking to go to an annual calendar and looking to take as much commitment out of the commitment as possible, essentially maximizing flexibility. I think that sort of summarizes what's happened, and so as a result, you're seeing people move into the scatter and spot market and we benefit tremendously from that. So right now you can \u2013 here's the Upfront market which is historically been a get together or a party, which is a relatively inefficient forward market. And then there's a spot market, and that has more and more moved to be a programmatic driven market. I think there is some insights to be gleaned from the ratings that were reported on the Olympics, which are of course down 45% over past Olympics. And, I don't think that's because NBC any wrong, it was just a question of discovery and just the nuance of the pandemic and whatnot. But that does make it so people are asking the question; what can I expect out of shows and this environment, and people are looking for more and more flexibility. And that may be just brings me to my last point, which is maybe at the very heart of your question, which is what role will we play in the Upfronts going forward? One of the biggest opportunities that our company has in its future is to play a central role in a more sophisticated forward market that replaces the Upfronts, where you can put data to work, and it's not an event or a party where everyone gets together, but it's an always on forward market that is data-driven and built on top of the spot market where people can make commitments and forecasting is better than it's ever been done in television, because the data is available. That's something that we're working very closely with some of the biggest names in TV and some of the biggest brands in the world, and some of the biggest agencies in the world to make certain that we upgrade the Upfronts, but that will make it so that programmatic is no longer primarily in the spot market, but it's also in the forward market. Absolutely, thank you. So maybe one of the most bullish numbers that we shared in this report is that CTV growth in EMEA grew 11x year-over-year, that number is really astounding and really surpass our own expectations. I think one way to characterize what's happened for us in CTV is to say The Trade Desk was leading in Australia and the United States going into the pandemic. And over the last 18 months or so, everything in the world has changed, consumption has changed. We had 3, 4, 5 years worth of change in television happened in that period of time. And so, what I say is one of the most bullish things that we've reported in this report or in this quarterly report is that it's because I do believe it those represent green shoots. I do believe it's the start of a change and where we were leading just in the U.S. and Australia we're now the seeing amazing results in Germany and the UK and Scandinavia and France and Spain. And we continue to maintain that all of it will eventually be traded programmatically or bought programmatically because that is a data-driven way that is more effective and it's the only way to preserve the amazing state of TV around the world, which is you get premium content, you see fewer and more relevant ads, and that creates a better user experience, which can fund more content. That virtuous cycle can only be perpetuated with a data-driven marketplace. And because that's just the math, that's just the way that it works. It's impossible for that not to take on everywhere around the world and we're seeing that play out now. As it relates to APAC, APAC is a little bit different in that \u2013 CTV is not always the place where premium content starts. That's much more common in the U.S., but because it is such a mobile region where mobile phones are often the place where content is \u2013 even premium content is consumed. You have to think of it as premium video TTV kind of in one bundle, especially in that market. But I think it's great to look at a case study. There's so many markets that we could report on, but because we just started in India this year, seeing this go into a market as big as ripe as India being the most populated country in the world, and then see us create partnerships in really a matter of months with Samsung Ads, Xiaomi, which has a huge presence in India and then Disney+, Hotstar to have those three content partnerships for premium content and to show ads on top of that in the most populated market in the world after only being there for months is indicative of just the momentum as well as how we continue to grab land around the world. So really optimistic about what I'm seeing around the world and kind of wins that our playbook that we've tested and proven in the U.S. and Australia is applicable to many other regions in the world. Yes. So, I'll just reiterate what I just said about CTV in EMEA. We had 11x growth year-over-year, which is one of the most bullish metrics that we've shared in this report. And we still feel like we're in early stages, but the green shoots that we're seeing I think are indicative of more to come and our partnerships in content around the world whether that's in London or Germany or Spain or Italy or France, are all indicative of great things to come. Blake on the second part. Yes. So, I'm really glad you've asked this question and I don't mind just being really open here, which is whenever you release a new \u2013 essentially a new platform, there's always some amount of anxiety you do as much research as possible, you test the market as much as possible, you listen as much as possible, and then you hope you got it right. And so we were really excited to ship Solimar, which is the biggest release in the history of the company. We had more engineering hours and people on this release than anything we've ever shipped ever. And to do most of that work during the pandemic where it's a little bit harder to do all those things like listen. I was anxious to see how it would be received of course optimistic and we were convinced we did the right thing, but you always want to see it in the numbers and that's exactly what we've seen. We've seen amazing traction. We're nearly a month in and the response has been fantastic. It does represent a behavior change though for the user, so they have to relearn something. But those that have taken the time to do it have all given us fantastic feedback that it is a better experience, which is exactly what we expected. And so, because it is a better experience that's why we're so optimistic that the majority of our ads will be bought on this new platform by the beginning of next year. And that represents more efficiency for the user. I'm especially excited about this going into Q4 because often what happens is Q4, as all of you know, is the biggest quarter of the year for us. But it's also where you prove yourself because much of the advertising spend is sort of determined by a calendar cycle, where in Q4 you spend the most, you performed the most. And then in Q1, you make a decision about where you're going to spend for the next year. And so if we have a really strong Q4, it sets up our Q1 really nicely for next year. And so I'm optimistic that the performance will set us up for next year. So I couldn't be happier with the way Solimar has gone so far, it's very early as you highlighted, and it represents a behavioral change. But I'm convinced that that's going to happen over time and really excited about what that means for efficacy on our platform. You bet. Appreciate the question. So as many may know, one of the things that is really important about preserving the amazing state of CTV is to provide relevant ads on the shows that you're watching when it's ad funded. And because of the nature of devices in CTV, it requires a bit more collaboration between the content owners, as well as those providing that. And so what we've needed, and many people talk about this in the context of cookies and browsing but that's not really what UID was designed for exclusively. It was designed to create a better currency for the entire internet, especially for a connected TV, so a content owner can have the same understanding of a user, pass that to those of us representing the advertisers. So that then we have a common understanding and can provide relevant advertising as well as make certain that we don't show the same ad five times in the same commercial break, make certain that we don't show them an ad that's irrelevant to them, and that makes them more effective. So all the TV companies have different ways of integrating with the Unified ID 2.0, some of them have gone to coalitions like Blockgraph or OpenAP and said, hey, you're a consortium and you're a technology consortium, so why don't you do the work for all of us? And there are others who have said, well, working in a consortium can take too long and we want to make certain that it integrates directly, and we have data that we want to put to work directly. And so from our standpoint, we're a indifferent, whether a consortium does the work, whether the content owners themselves do the work, many have put them on parallel paths, which is a commentary on how critically and strategically important it is for them and for us to get the IDs set up, so that we can provide those relevant ads. But Fubo moved to do it directly, to me is exciting because they could access that in another ways, but they want to make certain that they do it as quickly as possible. We expect that trend to continue just because the future of television is dependent on it. And then the second... Yes, Walmart. So yes, Walmart is on track. We continue to have really fantastic discussions with them. As it relates to how we'll be paid, we're paid the same way that we would with any other partnership where we have our standard platform fees and then they put their data exclusively to work in this version of their DSP, which is of course built on top of our platform. Yes. So the term critical scale, you pulled out I think a very important phrase that we used in our prepared remarks in the earnings report, which I do think is indicative of the moment that we're in right now, as it relates to the way the internet is going to work. And then you asked about if cookies were to go away today. So to be clear, Google announced that they don't expect cookies to go away before 2023. And they said \u2013 and even then, we'll just \u2013 we'll see when we get there. So I've been maintaining from the very beginning that I'm not certain that it's in the best strategic interest for Google to get rid of cookies at all, but that's not what this was about. Creating UID was not about replacing cookies. It was about creating a better internet and that doesn't just apply to the browsing internet, which as everyone knows, that's a small minority of what the internet is. Of course, your mobile devices and the related apps, as well as things like connected TV, which is some of the most effective advertising, maybe the most effective advertising that's ever been done at scale, which is all dependent on different IDs. But when you get to a place where the currency is so widely accepted, it becomes critical to doing business. So think of it like Visa or Mastercard, a currency that if you do not accept that currency in your local store, you are going to struggle to get business. You might be able to say, I won't accept American Express or I might not accept Discovery, but there are some currencies like either cash or Visa or Mastercard that you have to accept in order to just keep the doors open. That's where I believe UID is at that inflection point where it's become so interoperable with other currencies that making certain that you're interoperable, if you're something new or if you're a TV company, you will be operating at a disadvantage if you are not interoperable with UID 2. So when I say it's a critical scale, that's what I mean, that inflection point where you can't afford not to be a part of it. As it relates to the \u2013 to retail proof-of-concept, it's always great to partner first with the biggest retailer in the world. And so \u2013 and naturally that creates a bit of a case study and it lays down the gauntlet for everybody else. That of course has been done. And it would be strategically suboptimal to say it nicely for us to not be working on bringing other retailers and their data into the platform. Especially because of what I talked about in the prepared remarks where, we're trying to help the open internet, be an amazing contrast to walls garden. And that means, especially in measurement and the way that results are created and measured and by making everything comparable to each other, you make it to the open internet. It's a much better place to spend the lion share of your dollars than in walled gardens, where everything is opaque, and you're totally dependent on them to tell you how you did. And so in that environment, it becomes really important, especially for companies that sell their products in-stores, to have insights about how that performed. And of course, they want to see how it performed at Walmart, but there's a bunch of other retailers or a bunch of other stores that they also want to see where it transacted and there's of course, a bunch of other data about transactions that would help them discover what is actually working. And that's what's really critical for the open internet, it's at a moment, where we can actually show what's working and what's not, which is critical given it so easy to make ads on the internet, there's ads everywhere, so, which ones are working is a question that has to be answered better than ever before, because of what's driving on it, which is economic growth and recovery. You bet. So I really appreciate the question because I, I think Snowflake adopting UID2 is one of the biggest headlines that has happened for UID to date and not enough has been said about it. I don't think most people understand why this is so big. So first let just remind everyone that UID2 is no longer a Trade Desk product. We did most of the early developing, but it's owned by the community. We've worked together with the open internet. It's open source at this point. So it is way bigger than us. And some of the proof of that is adoption from companies like Snowflake. So if you don't know snowflake, what they do is they make it really easy for you to manage your data. So in the same way that Wix made it really easy for companies to build websites, Snowflake makes it really easy for companies to put their data to work. Now they're typically much bigger companies than those that Wix works with, but that's part of what makes it so exciting, is that \u2013 if they're trying to put data to work, they of course need to be leveraging the currencies that had scale. And so that makes it possible for that data to be more used and protected so that they can do the right thing by consumers, whether they're on the content side or whether they're on the advertiser side. So when a company who is so focused on making data actionable and listening to customer so that you can make certain that you're doing what they're asking for. The Snowflake using this just underscores just how much critical mass UID2 already have. And then as it relates to Solimar and its impact on the supply chain. What we have are spending a tremendous amount of time doing is trying to shed light on the supply chain. And what we're constantly asking, it is \u2013 our people in the supply chain adding more value than they extract. That's what we expect our own company to do. And that's what we expect everyone else in the supply chain to do. And then if that's not for us to decide on our own. But we do want to provide transparency so that the market can decide, especially because we represent so much demand. And so we are working night and day to make certain that we're shining the light of transparency on the supply chain, so that anyone in the supply chain, there's extracting more value chain, our charging more than the value they create, that they'd be removed from the ecosystem by the market, not by us so that the supply chain becomes more efficient. And the reason why this is so critical is, because the open market has to compete with walled gardens and one great, in some ways advantage wallet gardens have. Is that they have a shorter supply chain because they control it all. So we just need the market to do it same. And in order for it to do that, it needs transparency. Thanks, Justin, and thanks for everyone for joining the call today. Paul, I'll leave it with you to close it out."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, Q2 is a very strong quarter. Revenue of $280 million was up 101% from a year-ago. Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections last year, which represented a low-single-digit percentage share of our business in Q2 of 2020 revenue increased around 103% year-over-year. During the quarter, we benefited from continued improvement in the digital advertising environment from both agencies and brands. Growth was broad-based across all regions, channels and verticals. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a channel perspective. Our year-over-year revenue growth rates benefited from lapping slower growth related to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. With the continued strong top line performance in Q2, we generated $118 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 42% of revenue. EBITDA continues to benefit from temporarily lower than expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. This includes items such as travel and live company events that I've only just started to slowly resume. I'm proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate meaningfully positive EBITDA, while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that can drive our future growth. From a channel perspective: video, audio, and even display all more than doubled in Q2 from a year ago. Exiting Q2, mobile currently our largest channel represented a low-40s percentage share of our business. Video, which includes CTV, represented a high-30s percentage share of our business. Video as a percent of our mix continued to grow very rapidly. The increase in video is driven by CTV, which by a wide margin again, led our growth during the quarter. And finally display and audio represented about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented 87% of spend and international represented 13% as International's faster growth year-over-year resulted in a rising share of spend. In APAC, Shanghai and Hong Kong's spend growth were both very strong. In terms of our overall growth; Europe led the way growing well over 100% year-over-year in Q2. All of our offices in Europe, London, Hamburg, Paris, and Madrid should particularly strong growth. As Jeff highlighted, CTV drove our AMEA performance growing over 10 fold year-over-year. CTV, more than doubled its relative share of spend in Europe, while still small, relative to the share of CTV spend produced in North America we are optimistic about the trends we are seeing during the first half of 2021. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, the majority of them at least doubled during the quarter. Those verticals most impacted by COVID showed the most improvement overall, including travel, shopping and automotive. Home and garden, personal finance and food and drink were also very strong. We believe that there still a lot of recovery ahead of us in these segments and we can remain cautiously optimistic as we continue to see signs of improvement. Operating expenses for $218 million in Q2, up 41% year-over-year. The growth in operating expenses in the quarter was primarily driven by stock based compensation. Operating expenses, excluding stock based compensation grew 32% year-over-year. As we discussed last quarter, the majority of the growth in stock-based compensation expense in the first half of the year was related to the company's employee stock purchase plan. Our growth and operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation on a year-over-year basis is influenced not only by lower expense growth in the prior year associated with impacts related to COVID, but also by continued investments in our team, particularly in areas like; sales and marketing, technology and development, and the team supporting that progress as we continue to scale for longer term growth. Income tax was $13.9 million for the quarter representing a tax rate of about 23%. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $88 million or $0.18 cents per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.4 million in Q2; this was driven by a change in working capital driven by strong sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact quarterly results. DSOs exiting in Q2 were 82 days, down 14 days from a year ago. DPOs were 67 days, down eight days from a year-ago, the resulting 15 day gap between DSOs and DPOs is the smallest in the company's history. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $705 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In June, we refinanced a new revolving credit facility and currently have $443 million available under the facility. In addition, we also executed a 10-for-one stock split. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter; we estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $282 million, which will represent growth of 30.5% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding the U.S. political election spin, which represented a mid-single-digits percent of spend that we benefited from in Q3 2020 our estimated growth rate in Q3 of this year would be about 38% on a year-over-year basis. We estimated adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $100 million in Q3. In closing we're extremely pleased with our strong proponents in the quarter. We continue to execute and build on our solid foundation, and I could not be more excited about building on our progress in the second half of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let's open up the call for questions. Thanks, Tim. Sure and thanks for the question. I think, Shyam, I'll just talk a little bit about Q3 and then I'll try to address what I can on your question for the rest of the year in Q4. With Q3, there's so many positive trends and momentum in the Q2 and you've heard Jeff kind of highlights in those already. CTV is leading the way. The fundamentals of the business are really strong. The thing on Q3 is excluding political, which I would encourage people to think about as far as how to evaluate the underlying strength of the business on a year-over-year basis, we're showing significant acceleration year-on-year in Q3. I think that we're talking about excluding election Q3 of around 38% year-on-year and we were in the mid 20s for Q3 in the prior year, so really excited about that. As you think about and then moving on to the Q4, it does have more difficult comps than we see in Q3. You'll recall last year and we talked about this a couple of times, political breaths in Q4 last year was the biggest quarter that we had as a company was a high single-digit percent of our business, so really meaningful on a year-over-year basis. Also if you recall last year, Q4 is driven not just by that high single digit political span, but we also had a rebound in digital advertising as well, but I would just say regardless of the comps, there is so much momentum for us and the fundamentals of this business are so strong. I'm really optimistic about it. And then I'll just take the second part of that question on the beat on the bottom line for EBITDA. And so, more than half of the beat in the quarter on EBITDA was just really driven by the top line outperformance in the business. As many of you know, we don't have a lot of variable costs associated with higher top line. So when we see it come in flow is almost directly often down to EBITDA, so you see that. We did have some expense benefit as well. Some of that's timing, but it was broad-based, there wasn't anything like that I would major a call out. A little bit lower platform ops expense, a little bit of timing on some fixed marketing expense. We had better bad debt than expected a little bit because of continued health of the receivables, but nothing major though that I would call out. Just Walmart. Yes. So both of those making it easier to onboard your first-party data, as well as making it easier to measure success, are not about making more money for us directly. I really like the Amazon metaphor of spinning the flywheel faster, and there are some activities that you do in your business to make it so that your core activity goes better, and that the value exchange is even more obvious so that your customers spend more, do more with you. So in both cases, onboarding first-party data and measurement marketplace. My idea was that they're both free. So there's not an incremental take rate for those exact features. But if you get more spend on the platform, you make more money. And if you produce better results, you get more spend and you make more money. And so I'm absolutely after making more on this, but not on those features directly by giving them away, we make efficacy on the platform better. We make the open internet better, and we get more of that spend. And that's the idea. There will be cases in the measurement marketplace where people do pay and that's good. It's kind of like paid apps on your iPhone or your Android versus free apps, both are important and having some amount of paid apps, so that they're really high quality and it create the most competitive marketplace possible are important. So some of them will be paid, but I think the default maybe similar to on your phone, should be for free because that creates more usage and creates the better experience."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth. Sir, the floor is yours.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the call today are our Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of our operations are subject to change. So any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we also present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the Company's operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you can see from our earnings press release, The Trade Desk reported a very strong first quarter this year. This performance is especially encouraging because annual advertising budgets are often being reset and reconsidered in Q1, making them historically harder to predict. And this year, it was especially challenging because of the global pandemic. The unique worldwide business environment helped accelerate digital advertising in most parts of the world as we exited 2020. However, several verticals are still to come as we all march up and out of the recovery curve. For the quarter, we exceeded our own expectations, and this is another positive sign that The Trade Desk has emerged as the default demand-side platform for the open Internet. A steady stream of new brands and agencies started to work with us for the first time in Q1, and we continue to win additional spend from existing customers. Industry momentum around key drivers such as CTV and UID 2.0 could not be stronger. The challenges of the past year have only served to focus our attention on how we can drive real business value for our customers and partners. And that has enabled us to forge closer relationships with the biggest brands in the world. As a result, revenue was $219.8 million, an increase of 37% compared with a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased to a Q1 record of $70.5 million. This Q1 record is on both an absolute basis and the percentage of revenue basis. As we continue to grow and represent more and more large brands and a larger percentage of ad agencies brands, we will continue to become a more accurate bellwether for the open Internet and advertising spend. When you consider our performance in the context of the health of the overall advertising industry, you can see how we continue to outperform our industry and gain share. For example, WPP's Group M predicts worldwide advertising revenue will increase 10% in 2021. Publicis Group's Zenith expects overall U.S. added spending to rise 3.2% in 2021, following a drop of 5.4% last year. GroupM also predicts digital advertising will surge 1% to nearly $400 billion. We are growing at a pace well ahead of the industry. CTV continues to lead our growth and our international expansion continues to yield very encouraging results. Overall, international spend grew much faster than spend in North America. Growth in EMEA was especially strong. We are starting to see green shoots from the investments we have been making in CTV in Europe. APAC also outgrew the U.S., which is very encouraging. That is what we expect for the foreseeable future as the most rapid economic growth, driven by the rise of the largest middle class in history, will come out of Asia in the next decade. In order to provide some color on our results, I'd like to focus on three major points. First is the evolution of CTV. As I mentioned, CTV continues to be a major driver of our growth. but it's also the catalyst of broader change across the advertising landscape. Second, I'd like to touch on identity. There's a ton of discussion about identity in the industry right now with a fair number of misperceptions. And third, as we head into the summer, we'll be getting ready to launch our new platform, Solimar. And I'd like to spend a moment on what's new about the platform and why we think it's the right platform to meet the emerging needs of advertisers around the world. So, first, CTV. With so much attention on the CTV market today, it's sometimes easy to forget how far we've come in just a short amount of time. After all, CTV is a fairly young advertising channel. At first, the early mover market such as the U.S. and Australia, operated with fairly limited supply, as you'd expect. Back then, most connected TV was SVOD, subscriptions paid for the content, not ads. For most of the last few years, that created scarcity in the AVOD portion of the CTV market. That's scarcity by itself kept CPMs high. As the market evolved, more consumers shifted to CTV over the last couple of years. Almost all major content owners put more premium inventory online. Today, TV providers are fighting for consumer attention, and there is more competition than ever. The gap in cost adjusted efficacy between linear and CTV has stayed strong. However, as advertisers embrace CTV to leverage data and relevance, CPMs remain high, not because of scarcity, but because the power of data-driven targeting is quickly becoming more apparent. Only effective data-driven targeting can achieve the value sought after by advertisers. And just as important, preserve the high CPMs for publishers as premium inventory impressions increase. In other words, TV advertisers now have choice. They have the ability to differentiate between content and across channels more than ever. And that's critical to a healthy and competitive CTV market. TV is often the most effective part of a media plan. It's also generally the biggest. It is my prediction that AVOD will outpace the growth of SVOD over the coming years. But for that to happen, AVOD will need to get better at relevance and efficacy through products like Solimar, more to come on Solimar later. Now just to put the CTV market scale and perspective, according to Omdia's latest research, there are now more than 200 million active AVOD users in the U.S. alone. By 2024, Omdia predicts that annual CTV advertising revenue will top $120 billion, outperforming subscription revenue by more than 20%. Omdia also predicts that markets such as the U.K. and Germany will be the fastest-growing CTV markets outside of the United States, driven by very similar consumer shifts. These trends are very consistent with what we're seeing, and that's why we're investing so heavily in CTV. For example, we recently announced a new partnership with Sky TV, one of the major broadcasting platforms in the U.K. and more broadly across Europe, giving us access to one of the richest sources of premium inventory content in that region. Through our platform, advertisers now have the ability to be more deliberate about what CTV adds they buy and to apply data-driven decisioning in TV at increased scale and the increased scale and deliberate choices are affecting everything about the TV advertising business. Just look at the upfront process, which is kicking off again this month. More and more of the world's top advertisers are making programmatic buys a larger component of their upfront commitments. As you may have heard, from many advertisers publicly, they want more data-driven flexibility in their TV advertising campaign. They believe their digital buys should be a core element of their upfront commitment and the networks are adapting to that demand. Ultimately, this will lead to the development of a new programmatic forward market for CTV inventory. We are pioneering this work, collaborating with companies such as Magnit and FreeWheel. Our goal is to significantly improve the legacy upfront process by using more data and measurement to make better deals for both advertisers and content owners. This won't happen overnight. It will be a multiyear effort. But it's these kinds of innovations that are making The Trade Desk such an integral component of the tech showcases that major platforms, such as Disney, NBCU and Nielsen are putting together as a part of the upfront this year. I'm encouraged by how traditional TV companies and broadcasters are thinking about this. They are not standing still or waiting around, they are leading. With NBCUniversal, for example, we're working on innovative ways to bring e-commerce into the CTV experience. So if you see an ad for a product, you can interact with it and purchase it with one click right on the screen. Broadcasters are also applying the same innovation focus to the world of identity. In the last couple of weeks, we've announced collaborations with OpenAP and Blockgraph. These companies are each owned by some of the largest TV networks in the United States. They are both working on creating new approaches to identity that work for CTV, which bridge between CTV and linear TV. Both organizations have announced that their technology will be interoperable with UID 2.0, which brings me my second point, the evolving world of identity. Let me start the discussion of identity by clarifying what we're talking about. This discussion on identity is bigger than cookies. It's bigger than any company or any channel. Cookies are not present in CTV. However, a privacy safe identifier for CTV will be a major factor in driving relevant ads and managing reach and frequency across apps, channels and devices. CTV needs this kind of approach in order to maintain or increase CPMs in a way that help fund the amazing content that has kept most consumers sane during this pandemic. The current TV content arms race cannot be financially sustained for providers or consumers without relevant ads. So you can see how the identity discussion is bigger than cookies or even CTV or Google's decision to deprecate cookies for the browsing Internet. This is a discussion about how the Internet pays for itself. It's also a discussion about control. Is the Internet going to be controlled by a few large tech companies? Or will power be distributed and will choice sit with consumers and their relationship with each content owner. We launched the UID project with the goal to improve the Internet. This is not merely a marketing campaign about how deeply we care about consumers, the quality of the Internet or consumer privacy. Of course, we deeply value all of those things, which is why this is not about marketing, but about action. It is a movement. We are working with the leaders in the open Internet to build a better Internet. We want consumers to have control in a privacy-forward manner that transcends a single company's ecosystem, and that's why identity continues to be the hottest topic of conversation in our industry. It feels like every media outlet from The Wall Street Journal to the advertising trades is covering identity these days. Google has issued several blogs over the past couple of months clarifying their position on identity. They plan to use a Google log-in at the core part of their identity solution. But at the same time, in some cases, they've been critical of others doing something very similar. While we'd like to see Google support the open Internet more publicly, given DoubleClick is one of the most important open Internet players, they are doing a good thing by making privacy a priority for Google. Fortunately, for The Trade Desk, since founding the Company back in 2009, the health of the entire digital advertising ecosystem has been a core value of our company. We care deeply about improving the entire Internet, not just our small corner of it. We have a guiding principle that informs every product we ship. What do I, as a consumer, want the experience to be for me, for my family? We enter these questions first. And then, of course, work to make sure that everything conforms to both the letter and spirit of the law. New ID is built for consumers with better content and an Internet where power is distributed, not consolidated. It is designed to operate with a clear consent framework, better explanations about the value exchange of free content and improved consumer controls. We have always believed that taking a consumer-first approach is the only way to address identity over the long term in a way that meets the growing regulatory and consumer focus on privacy. We're skeptical about solutions that lean on opaque cohorts or solutions that try to make decisions for consumers instead of providing consumer choice. We do not believe those options are sustainable as privacy conscious in the long term. They don't empower consumers sufficiently. And that's also why the open Internet is rapidly adopting UID 2.0 because this is much bigger than The Trade Desk. UID 2.0 is about a better Internet. It will be open sourced with independent government. Personally, I was inspired this last quarter when working directly with Artur, the CEO of Publicis, to make sure that their ID and UID 2.0 were interoperable. Like Artur, there are so many people and leaders across the open Internet that are engaging with us and recognizing the significance of this moment. The momentum behind UID 2.0 is beyond anything I could have scripted. And for me, it's probably the most inspiring movement that I've experienced in this industry. I don't think I've explained well for Wall Street how UID 2.0 has gotten so much scale so quickly and why I'm so positive about this movement. Let me try to add more clarity. Remember how UID work. A consumer sign-in once with their e-mail address and then opt in site by site, just once per site or at or channel. This is a significant improvement to the consumer Internet experience today, where intrusive toast or cookie pop-ups, appear on almost every premium content site and seemingly every time you go there. Some have mistakenly thought that UID 2.0 is an SSO or a single sign-on and that we are trying to build something like Gmail with the hope of attracting billions to a new brand and a new consumer-facing log-in service. It isn't. It's a common ID that can be used by many different advertisers and publishers. It often originates from publishers with existing sign-on systems. Consumers can then engage with privacy settings and opt-out directly from the services they know. While we're partnering with several industry leaders like Criteo to build a new SSO to help medium and smaller publishers, those efforts are innovations on top of UID 2.0. With UID 2.0, the first e-mail authentication provides the consumer with the explanation of the value exchange of the Internet. The goal is to make it clear and consistent. And with adoption by a who's who of leading publishers and supply-side partners, the UID 2.0 community has already achieved significant scale. UID 2.0 does not need some magic number of single signs to be on par with the billions of cookies out there to be successful. We are already seeing widespread adoption by integrating with existing publisher sign-on systems. The Wall Street Journal reported 50 million UID authenticated users in the U.S. a couple of months ago, and we have seen more partners adopt since then, multiplying that user number. And remember, we're only a few weeks into beta testing. The list of publishers, advertisers and data partners that are currently in the integration process or committed to UID 2.0 is larger than those that we've announced publicly. The progress we've made on USD 2.0, the momentum we are seeing is all beyond anything we could have envisioned this early. I'm so glad to have worked with executives at the biggest brands and biggest agencies and biggest TV companies, biggest websites to implement something bigger than any one of us. It's an honor to partner with so many companies and to UID 2.0 evolve as something that belongs to the community, and this is not just a U.S. phenomenon even though we are early in the journey outside of the U.S. We're seeing rapid progress in key markets such as Australia, Southeast Asia and in Europe with major publishers and advertisers joining this industry-wide effort. I'm convinced that over the past month. The momentum behind UID 2.0 has only been hastened by Google's latest position statement. Those blogs galvanize an entire industry on a new approach. The Trade Desk our agency partners, advertisers and premium content partners care deeply about consumer privacy. Remember that most major brands and many premium content providers have a decades-long relationship with their consumers. I've never met a large brand or a content owner that wants to ever violate consumer trucks or even just be seen to violate drug. They worked so hard to build that trust over many years, and that's why trusted brands such as Hershey's, have declared their support for UID 2.0. And because of our commitment to trust and transparency many content owners are happy to partner and share data with companies like The Trade Desk. It's the companies in the middle that they're concerned about. And that's why we're excited about one of the innovations we're building on top of UID 2.0. It's being developed initially for certain broadcast networks and it's called double encryption for publishers or DEP. DEP allows publishers to encrypt UID 2.0 and only unencrypted for designated parties -- such as a particular advertiser or partner. DEP protects against data leakage and the publisher has the power to control the process with precision. As such, DEP is an important innovation for publishers as they integrate their single sign-on process into a broader ecosystem. This can be used to prevent a company in the middle, even in the ad-serving wall garden from taking data or insight. By the way, this is just one example of how UID 2.0 allows for innovation on top of the core open source technology. In this way, UID 2.0 will ultimately prove to be an innovation that supports more than just today's privacy expectations. At the same time, it's also important to note how UID 2.0 can accelerate the goals of the California Consumer Privacy Act and Europe's GDPR. We believe that UID 2.0 best meets the evolving regulatory principles around privacy that are being put into place around the world. So you have to focus on the principles, and those principles focus on consumer control, which is the design point of UID 2.0. In many ways, we believe UID 2.0 is the vehicle that enables regulations such as GDPR to realize their full potential. Another important aspect of UID 2.0 beyond the core identity service is its emerging role as a new common currency of the open Internet. Advertisers have the ability to deterministically measure more effectively across channels, and to better manage frequency across channels and devices in a way that is simply not possible with cookies, for example. It is also in this context that our partnership with Publicis becomes important. Publicis has recently announced that they would make their Epsilon core ID interoperable with UID 2.0, and that The Trade Desk would become the exclusive third-party DSP for Publicis' core IV services. The epsilon core ID graph includes IDs for more than 250 million users and a wide range of on-site and off-site data. The ability to integrate with this kind of offsite data is critical, as advertisers think about activating their own first-party data in a new identity environment. Whether we are talking business performance measurement or broadening audience segments or brand safety, partnerships with companies such as Publicis and Walmart are so important to realizing the full potential of data-driven advertising, and there are many more in the works. Take the shopper marketing industry as an example. According to some estimates, the TAM for shopper marketing is well over $100 billion. More and more retailers are recognizing the value and power of their shopper data. Listen to almost any retail earnings conference call these days, and you see how companies want to activate their first-party data or monetize their proprietary data. Retailers are starting to work with us on strategies to liberate data so their suppliers can market more effectively in a secure privacy safe way. The go-to-market approach for each retailer may be slightly different. But the common threat is that these retailers understand that the only way to realize the full value of their data is on the open Internet. There's no point in building walls around it. Brands will, over time, always gravitate to places where they can be deliberate and where they can measure ad impressions across channels. There are some companies, mostly those with a dominant walled garden approach that believe the Internet can be controlled by a few. Then there's the rest of us who believe that an open competitive Internet marketplace is the only real viable approach that preserves value and opportunity for all participants. By the way, I don't think there's anything in the advertising world that will unite fierce competitors today more than its principle. Many of our largest customers are fierce adversaries with each other every single day. But they agree on this, and we are honored to be working with all of them to improve privacy standards and practices across the Internet. We all agree that the open Internet is the best way to activate first-party data and to measure campaign performance against real business goals with a much clearer understanding of actual consumer actions, which leads me to the third point I want to cover today, the launch of our new Solimar platform later this summer, which incorporates many of these principles. Just think about the pressures that today's marketers are under proving the ROI of every advertising dollar, which means that advertisers want better measurement and the ability to tie measurement to actual business outcomes like sales in a Walmart store or foot traffic onto an auto dealership, activating valuable first-party data in a secure way that respects consumer privacy, all in a new identity environment. And completely rethinking how to approach EV advertising, which is the largest channel for many of our advertisers. Solimar has been many years in the making and is the biggest platform upgrade in our history. And it has been designed and engineered to meet these evolving needs of the modern marketer. For one thing, the U.S. is completely redesigned. It brings all the features of our platform together in a very easy-to-use interface. It starts with your goals as a marketer, whether those are marketing goals or business goals or some combination, better, more expressive, more detailed goal setting at the outset means that the Co-op AI systems can be more effective for the media trader, optimizing campaigns on the fly. Solimar will have the industry's easiest on-ramp for our customers' valuable first-party data. In a new identity environment, that data becomes even more important, but advertisers want to unleash it in a secure, trusted environment. Solimar provides that, and innovations such as UID 2.0 and DEP will only increase advertiser trust in the platform. And Solimar is a closed loop system. It does more of the work for you, engaging a much richer measurement marketplace, incorporating on-site and off-site data so an advertiser can better tie a marketing campaign to a real business outcome. Again, think about the shopper data example. Advertisers want to understand how their campaigns are driving in-store sales. We are building that off-site data into solar. Whether it's retail stores or auto dealerships or ticket sales or any other form of business performance data, so the advertising campaign can seamlessly optimize for those business goals. In doing so, Solimar liberates the media trader to focus on campaign performance rather than having to turn the dials on every aspect of campaign management. Solimar can manage the details, allowing the media trader to focus on more strategic objectives. So with the Solimar launch, we will be heading into the second half of the year with a great deal of excitement and momentum about our ability to best serve the needs of the modern marketer. And let me wrap things up on this point. We are off to a very positive start in 2021, exceeding our expectations. And that's because advertisers are increasingly gravitating to our platform as the default DSP of the open Internet. But we are not resting on our laurels. As you know, we are consistently investing in our business so we can continue to lead our industry, whether that's international expansion, innovative partnerships with companies such as Walmart and Publicis, new channels such as CTV, major platform upgrades such as Solimar for integrating valuable new data and measurement capabilities. And all of those investment decisions are informed by the emerging needs of our customers, advertising agencies and major brand advertisers of the world. They are becoming more data-driven than everything that they do and their expectations of how they unleash data are only growing. And that, more than anything, is what makes me so excited and confident about the future. We are excited to compete for every digital advertising dollar. When we compete, we usually win. And with that, let me hand it over to Blake to talk about the financials.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, 2021 has started out strong, despite the lingering challenges faced around the world. Q1 revenue was $220 million, a 37% increase from a year ago. Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections last year, which represented a mid-single-digit percent share of our business in Q1 of 2020, revenue increased around 42% year-over-year in Q1 of this year. This represents a material acceleration on a sequential basis from Q4 of 2020 after excluding election spend. In Q1, we benefited from continued improvement in the digital advertising environment from both agencies and brands. Growth was broad-based across all regions and channels, with particular strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a channel perspective. Our year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from lapping COVID-related headwinds that we experienced toward the end of March last year. With the continued strong top line performance in Q1, we generated $70.5 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 32% of revenue. EBITDA continues to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. This includes items such as travel and live company events that have not yet started to resume. Even recognizing that, I'm proud of our continued ability to consistently grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow. From the channel perspective, video, audio, mobile and display all grew well into the double digits in Q1. Video, which includes CTV, again, led our growth during the quarter followed by audio. Geographically, North America represented 87% of spend, and international represented 13% of spend. International's overall share grew slightly from Q4 and the prior year due to faster growth in APAC and Europe relative to North America. That said, spend growth accelerated in all of our major regions as North America, APAC and Europe grew spend well into the double digits again year-over-year in Q1. Our offices in Europe showed particularly encouraging results, as each office grew spend faster year-over-year in Q1 than total company spend. In APAC, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo spend all more than doubled. It is still early days for us internationally, but we are optimistic on the trends we are seeing at the start of 2021. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, the majority of them grew in double digits during the quarter. Home & Garden, technology and computing and shopping were all very strong with both Home and Garden and technology and computing more than doubling during the quarter. Automotive continued its return growing faster than the rest of the business during the month of February and March, while improving the travel and entertainment verticals still lag compared to others, but both are showing signs of promise so far in Q2. There is still a lot of recovery ahead of us in these segments, and we are starting to see potential signs of optimism. Operating expenses were $212 million in Q1, up 41% year-over-year. The growth in operating expenses in Q1 was primarily driven by stock-based compensation. Operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, grew 26% year-over-year. A majority of the growth in stock-based compensation expense in Q1 was related to the Company's employee stock purchasing plan. We currently estimate that stock-based compensation growth should moderate from current levels in the second half of the year. Income tax was a benefit of $14.6 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $70 million, or $1.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $75 million in Q1 and free cash flow was $61 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 93 days, up one day from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, up six days from a year ago. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $680 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved a 10:1 stock split to make the stock more accessible to our employees and to a broader base of investors. Trading of The Trade Desk stock will begin on a stock split adjusted basis on June 17, 2021. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect Q2 year-over-year total revenue growth to significantly accelerate relative to the growth rate we saw in Q1 as we lapped slower growth related to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. We estimate Q2 revenue to be between $259 million and $262 million, which would represent growth of between 86% to 88% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at least $84 million in Q2. I would remind you that the relative strength in our EBITDA forecast continues to benefit due to the virtual environment our teams are working in. As we think about the full year, we continue to model for an improving digital advertising environment, and we continue to expect a reasonable acceleration in our revenue growth relative to 2020. That said, in the second half of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth. In particular, our Q4 growth rate will comp against the significant spend we generated in Q4 of last year, driven by the rebound in digital advertising as well as material U.S. political election spend that we benefited from in that period. If you recall, U.S. political election spend represented a high single-digit percent share of our total spend in Q4 of 2020. In closing, while the past year has been far different from anything we could have expected, we continue to grab share and deliver sustainable top line growth and profitability, all while building better relationships with our customers and partners. I'm extremely proud of the way that our employees navigated the challenges of the past year with grit, resilience and with an unwavering commitment to our values as a company. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly, ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for question. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Shyam Patil from SIG. Shyam, your line is live.\nShyam Patil: Nice job on the continued execution. I just had one question. When we look at the year, it seems like there are a lot of moving parts with comps and seasonality kind of as you talked about, Blake. But you guys also have Solimar, you have shopper marketing going live. You have continued momentum with TTV. I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the business and the growth when you take all these things into account for the rest of the year?\nJeff Green: Yes. Thanks, Shyam. And I also appreciate the kind words. Yes, there is so much that I'm excited about for this year. And I think it's fair to say that I've never been more bullish on our business and especially, I have never been more -- or more bullish about CTV in our business. The CTV in Q1, once again, more than doubled spend compared to Q1 of last year. So once again, the trend just highlighting just how impressive the trends in CTV actually are, of course, the move to CTV away from linear or traditional television just continues to accelerate. Blake will talk in just a second. In fact, I'll let him add some color on this question relating to what that means when you extract political. But to me, the macro trend is the thing to focus on most, which is COVID and the quarantine made everybody stay at home and stream more television and also put pressure on the consumer so that they're looking at their entire TV experience and essentially, looking for value and looking for things to cut. And that has meant that cord cutting in linear cable television has accelerated, and that people are looking more and more at Internet fuel TV. Because there are also more apps than there have ever been, content discovery is tougher in CTV than it's ever been. Is it on that app? Or is it on that other app? That's a harder question than it's ever been. And it's also harder for AVOD companies to actually become SVOD companies. So they, in fact, need to sell ads and they need them to be relevant in order to be highly effective. What that means is that AVOD is accelerating more than any other part of CTV. And it means that a platform that sits in the middle, like ours does looking across all these different apps and channels. So that we can help advertisers manage reach and frequency, help them shop for value and being one of the, if not the largest source of demand for all these quality content owners means that our future has never been more bright in CTV, which is the part of our business that I'm most excited about. I imagine we'll get a chance to talk more about UID in a second. I'll talk about some of the momentum there. But our overall business stays strong. I'm sure I've left off some highlights. Blake, what would you add?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And thanks, Shyam, for the question. I just would reiterate what Jeff said, the fundamentals of the business are really quite strong, in my opinion. The thing to keep in mind, like you said, with all the quarterly comparisons, against last year when we benefited from that U.S. political spend. Q1 accelerated not only year-over-year, but on a sequential basis from Q4, once you exclude political. In the prepared remarks, I think I mentioned that you would take the Q1 growth rate of 37% in revenue, that's more like 42% when you exclude political, and then that's comparing really to like a mid-30s growth rate in Q4 of 2020. So that's super optimistic that we can see that acceleration once you exclude that kind of noise we had a bit from the political side. And then as we look at into Q2, reflected in that guidance of the 86% to 88% year-over-year growth that also reflects an acceleration on a two-year stack basis versus Q1. So that trend also is something that makes us super optimistic. So with all of that seeing reasonable acceleration this year on a full year basis gets me really excited, comfortable about the business and where things are in 2021, but the momentum that we've got from all the things like in CTV and the other areas that we've talked about, a number of times gives us really optimism for momentum, not just in 2021, but into 2022 and beyond as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research. Vasily, your line is live.\nVasily Karasyov: Jeff, I know you covered the Unified ID 2.0 quite extensively. The question I get from investors is where we are in terms of the scale of adoption and where do we need to be for it to be sort of a seamless transition from third-party Chrome cookies to Unified ID 2.0 world? And then another quick question on Unified ID is you talked about DEP, and I think, at least I got a little more confused about Unified ID. Can you please remind us in layman terms, how it works?\nJeff Green: Absolutely and very much appreciate the question because there's so much that has been said, so much that needs to be said about this. And despite our best efforts, I still think there's a lot that can be said to provide clarity. So let me start by just saying Unified ID is a privacy-first initiative that is -- was initially started by The Trade Desk, but it is something that is a movement among the entire open Internet. And it's so much bigger than our company at this point with hundreds of companies working on this at this point, in part because of our efforts to open source it and get the entire community involved. And because of the fact that it, by itself is encrypted as well as it comes with terms of service, it is a substantial upgrade to cookies and creates a better Internet for everybody. And that's one of the things that I think is just a little bit different about what we're doing here is that we're trying to create a better Internet for everybody. We're not just trying to protect ourselves, which I think there are a lot of tech companies that that's their primary focus, and we're trying to create a better Internet. Because that's been our focus, when we go talk to major publishers and content owners and advertisers about joining this movement and they realize the way the tech works as well as what we're after, it's really easy for them to get on board. Now, of course, you have to understand the technology, which is somewhat esoteric. But because of the fact that we've gotten so much support from companies like Criteo and from LiveRamp, from Nielsen from the Washington Post, and industry initiatives like -- or bodies like Prebid and Pram and IV, we're really excited to have that sort of support and momentum. We -- in The Wall Street Journal, I know they printed a month or two ago that there have been 50 million UID authenticated users in the United States alone. We've seen that increase by multiples since then. So the momentum is just unbelievable. And the number of companies that are in the process of implementing is exponentially higher than those that we've issued press releases on. So anybody that wants to go see the caliber of companies that we've been working with. You can see a double-digit number of press releases of companies adopting that and supporting it. I've had multiple CMOs from the biggest brands in the world say, we're with you. If there's anything we can do to help you, please let us know. We've heard the same thing from TV -- content owners, the biggest content owners in the world. So it's just been fantastic. The momentum is unbelievable. And then just two last points that I want to cover on this, one is some people say, well, what does this mean? And what does the momentum mean? And what does -- what will the world look like next year when cookies are deprecated and we're relying on unified ID and things like it? I personally think the Internet is going to be a lot better. And it's going to be a lot better because you'll get rid of those annoying toast that say there are cookies on this site, and you'll lost in one time per Internet with an e-mail address, so in other words, one time. And then you opt in one by one for each site and for each app so that you're giving them consent, which I think is in line with what GDPR and CCPA and even what Apple is trying to do, which is give empowerment to the consumer and better explain the quid pro quo of the Internet. And because I think we'll -- as a general Internet community, do a better job of explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet. I also think that data companies that are doing the right thing, meaning getting consents and operating in a way that we would all want them to be operating, they'll thrive and they're going to be doing better than they've ever done before. Cookies were actually a really crappy methodology for them to build their best businesses on top of. So I think that's going to be a lot better. To answer your more sort of esoteric or nuance question about DEP, so what Unified ID enables in part because we're open sourcing it and we're making it so that people can innovate on top of it. That's the thing that's really great about open source code is that you can create innovations on top of it. And that's where our work with Criteo and others to build a single sign-on comes in. That's an innovation on top of Unified ID. And that's also where DEP comes in. So let me take a stab at explaining what DEP is. So it stands for double encryption for publishers. And the reason why we're calling it double is because UID has already encrypted itself. So you can actually encrypt that again. And by encrypting that again, you make it so that you're effectively the publisher, creating the key where you can decide who can unlock that and gain any insight. So as they're passing an identifier like UID 2.0, and they could use it on any other identifier, as they're passing that in a request for a bid or in the sort of mechanics that fuel the Internet, they can encrypt it and then they, at their own discretion, and decide who can unencrypted which is separate from the encryption that comes with UID. So by providing additional layers of encryption, we're providing additional layers of security for consumer privacy as well as for the value chain of the Internet. Hopefully, that commentary just gives you some added color, but I could not be more excited about the momentum. I never dreamed it would go this fast. And all the discussion on privacy as well as identity has actually fueled the momentum.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Tim, your line is live.\nTim Nollen: Jeff, can I come back to your comments on CTV, particularly in the upfront markets, which you're just getting underway right now, and give us a bit more color really on what you're doing there with networks and with advertisers? And part of the question is, if the upfront is a futures market, programmatic is to-date has been largely a scatter market. I just -- if you maybe help us understand, how does programmatic work its way into the upfront itself? How do things like guarantees work and delivery of that? Just any more color you can give us on really how your role, The Trade Desk's role and programmatic buying would work in the upfront market? Thanks very much.\nJeff Green: Absolutely. So first, big picture on CTV, just want to underline that our CTV spend more than doubled in Q1, which just gives us a tremendous amount of momentum. And that's why we're just merely breaking ground on improving the upfront process. So upfronts are, as you highlight, a form of a forward market or buying in advance, but it's a little bit different than what's happened inside of programmatic, where with programmatic, we bring so much more data to the table than what's been used to transact television for the last many decades. That programmatic can be way more effective. It's what enables content owners to have fewer ads than a commercial break, and it's what enables them to get CPMs that are multiples higher than what they can get in traditional television. So running an upfront in traditional television with lower CPMs, while running a scatter or spot market with higher CPMs, is a bit counterintuitive to the way that TV has historically worked, where you're paying a little bit extra for the assurance of it running and buying an advance, which benefits both sides. So in order for -- we think the upfront market to evolve, you have to create a new marketplace where you layer more data on top of it so that you can get those same premiums. And we think that there is no way for that to exist at any scale without us being actively involved, which is why we highlighted in our prepared remarks that we're working with some of the biggest names in television to make that a reality, and really excited about a new structure for a forward market that just enables more data to be brought to the table. In the meantime, irrespective of those engineering efforts because of the lack of predictability partly because of COVID and just the state of the world in the future, but also because cord cutting is accelerated because television is just a little bit harder to predict in and of itself. There are more dollars that are sort of sitting on the sidelines of the upfronts as well as looking for things in programmatic to buy on an always-on basis instead of having to make really huge commitments at a moment where you have less visibility. So you put all that together, we're in a phenomenal position. We're taking incremental dollars that are coming from upfront into digital and programmatic, and we expect, as we continue to roll out, this long-term effort to revamp the upfront with a forward market -- a programmatic forward market that will move more and more dollars in years to come, so a ton of bullishness on what's happening in CTV and the upfronts specifically.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from David Beckel from Berenberg David. David, your line is live.\nDavid Beckel: I have two on UID 2.0. It sounds like there's been significant progress on authenticated users, mentioning multiples of the 50% that was previously reported. But I did pick up on a comment, Jeff that you made about, they're not needing to be a magic number of authenticated users, if I'm interpreting that right, to be sort of on par with the efficacy of cookies. I'm wondering if you could just expand on that a little bit because I think there was some confusion among investors exactly how many people need to be signed up to replicate that effectiveness, but it sounds to me like you're saying that's not even the right way to look at things necessarily? That's the first question. And then second, just on some of the larger platforms, Google, obviously, and Apple have sort of cast dispersions about the acceptance of ash e-mail identifiers like presumably UID 2.0. Do you anticipate a reconciliation at some point with those platforms to get them on board to the way that you look at privacy through UID 2.0?\nJeff Green: Awesome. Thank you very much. So first, Let me talk a little bit about why there is no need for the sort of magic number. So there's a couple of reasons why we frame it that way. And I think you're right that it is a different paradigm that's required. So we're in this really phenomenal position, which is we essentially get to listen and an opportunity to buy roughly 12 million ads every single second on the Internet. It's just a massive amount of volume of ads that are available across the entire open Internet every second and every day, all day. And so when you get to listen and look at that many impressions and then choose which ones you want to bid on, as long as you have insight on a good portion of those, you're in the phenomenal position to pick ones that you know will be effective. And so whether that's on 71% of ads or on 63% of ads is less important than do you have enough critical mass that you can apply data on those where it's present? And then do you have a common understanding of the user with the supply chain, which UID does a way better job of creating a common understanding than cookies ever did. I also think it's really important to think about it differently because we are not trying to build an SSO. So some people have sort of wrongly thought that UID is us, one by one knocking on consumers' virtual doors trying to get to a $2 billion number like a Gmail or Facebook users or something like that. And that's not the case at all. And instead, what we do is we partner with consumer-facing brands that are part of the open Internet, which is pretty much everybody except for five, six, seven companies. So by partnering with all of those companies who have log-ins and relationships directly with consumers and then being a huge source of ad demand for them, which, as you know, most things on the Internet are ad-funded, it becomes a very big cooperative where we're all working together. And it's that big cooperative that I think is a good segue to the second part of your question, where you've highlighted that some big names intact like Google have said, hey, we're the best at providing privacy-centric methodologies on the Internet. So I think that's debatable. And I don't necessarily think that simply handing all of our data over to Google or any one company is a good idea. In fact, I think it's a very bad idea. Instead, I think there needs to be a system where you give consumers more control, and you actually encourage data to stay where it is, stop moving it all around and especially stop putting it all in one place. And so I don't necessarily need a Google or Apple or anybody else to see the world the way that we do. I get that this is a very important moment for them to say that there the best in the world of privacy, even if I disagree with that statement. But what we do need is the community to come together and work together outside of those handful of companies. And in part, because of the strong positions that those companies have taken, the community is coming together in a way we never saw with GDPR or really anything else. I've never seen the community, the Internet communities that ad-funded community that basically powers and funds the Internet, come together and collaborate in a way I've never seen this happen. I've just never seen what we're experiencing right now in the way that we're experiencing right now ever before. And so that's all that we need in order for this to be successful. We don't need to all agree on everything because I don't think that will ever happen.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Brian, your line is live.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Jeff, we got an update from Google recently on FLoC. And since then, the waters have even been muddied a bit, quite frankly. It's not clear if FLoC will be workable under EU. And then there's some broader concerns about whether FLoC would enable discrimination and adds for things like housing and mortgages. So I want to know if you had any high-level thoughts on what Google is doing, what clients and potential clients are saying about it. And how you think that impacts the dynamics in terms of DSP share going forward? And then a quick addendum to that would be, is the pace of share gains you were seeing versus Google, is that accelerating versus what you saw previously in the wake of double-click ID deprecation\nJeff Green: Great. So In the first part of your question, let me just start by saying, sometimes we talk about Google like there's a collective mind that Google and there isn't. And I think it's fair to say that the way that Sundar and the executive team have managed this is to empower each of the local departments or each of the different apartments at Google to make their own decisions and act in their own interest. And so if you talk to people at Chrome, as we have, they have a very different position than the people in ads or a double click. And they have a very different position from the people in Android. So there's a lot of different opinions at Google and sometimes those that make it into a blog post or things like that or into the public arena are not representative of thousands of people at Google that have a different position. And maybe there's nowhere that that's more apparent in this discussion than with FLoCs. So there has been a lot of question made about FLoC. I do think that's part of the reason why Google has said, if we do end up using them, we won't use them in Europe. And they've also acknowledged that if they do end up using those as a replacement to cookies and not using things like Unified ID that DV360 will be operating at a disadvantage and that they will be operating at a substantial disadvantage in connected TV, and they will also be operating at a substantial disadvantage in Europe. So you can understand why that would inspire some parts of Google to say, we really need to rethink FLoCs And there are those that look at FLoCs and say, they're actually more -- they create more privacy risk than cookies ever did. And I think there's an argument to be made, but that depends on the details of how they end up working and what they actually end up doing with FLoCs. I think there's a reasonable chance they will never see the light of day because of some of those risks and concerns. But if they do it in a very basic way, then it could be a great supplement to UID, but if Google, especially didn't use things like UID, and then they did use blocks in a very basic way, which would not have privacy concerns, they would be operating at a pretty meaningful disadvantage because they wouldn't have something else that wouldn't do anything close to what cookies did, so very much an open question. As it relates to share gains, it's really hard to answer that at this point because of the fact that cookies have not gone away. And so one of the things that really encouraging is that because cookies have not gone away, which often inspires action like in GDPR, people waited until changes happened. And then they started implementing what they should have in anticipation of change. This is going quite the opposite. People are making changes in anticipation of what's coming. However, because cookies are still in place, there hasn't been sort of fidelity lost and also because the discussions have been so robust and just everywhere, it's hard to tell what's fueling share gains one over another. I will say that the amount of discussion and wins that we're having relative to all of our competition is greater than I've ever seen it. So it's a really phenomenal time to be in this space. And even though it's a little bit confusing because of all the discussion around identity, the open Internet, in part fueled by CTV and AVOD is doing as well as it's ever done before.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. Mark, your line is live.\nMark Zgutowicz: Jeff, I'm just curious, is the elephant in the room here really can set rates, and I'm just curious how you see the levels of consent rates today coming in, I think, well below most expectations. And if we kind of fast forward to Android ID sort of following in Apple's footsteps, how does that sort of affect the rollout of UID 2.0?\nJeff Green: You bet. So I do think that consent is at the core of the discussion that's happening inside of identity. And it's -- our big tech companies going to make the decision for consumers? Are -- you're seeing this a little bit in the tug a board that's happening between Apple and Facebook. It is about where does consent come from. And what we're asking the Internet to do is do a better job of explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet and then empower consumers. Make it simpler, easier and more consistent but for them to understand the quid pro quo. Okay, I'm sharing some amount of data and insight so that you can show me relevant ads. And for that, I get free content. We just think that quid pro quo of the Internet has never been explained very well. We can all look at what companies -- some of the big tech companies are doing on that front and have our complaints and whatnot. But overall, we're all moving towards in the same direction, which is giving consumers more control and more ability to create consent. And it's forcing content owners to better explain that quid pro quo of the Internet. What I just want to make sure happens is that consumers do have the ability to weigh in and preserve the competitive nature of the Internet rather than companies, especially those that are very big and maybe focused on protecting themselves more than the Internet can disrupt that, even if it's just a speed bump, which I do think anything any single company does is just a speed bump because I don't think you can disrupt that quid pro quo of the internet in any long term.\nMark Zgutowicz: Yes. And I respect that, I guess -- but I mean, it's Apple and Google that are sort of controlling privacy policy, I guess, much more so than GDPR and CCPA. So if we think about the fact that hash e-mails, which is obviously the underlying protocol of UID, does not have the ability to function because there are low consent rates. Doesn't that sort of mitigate your ability to drive scale with your UID effort?\nJeff Green: So I guess I just disagree with the premise of the question that there's low consent rates, that's not the case. And I think some are maybe misapplying IDFA opt-ins, which have numbers that have been shown all over the place. It depends on who your sources are in terms of what the opt-in rates are in terms of IDFA. But what I predict is that long term that people are going to opt in, especially for things like Facebook and Twitter and these apps that have been staples. They will better explain the quid pro quo of the Internet and then consumers are going to opt in. In fact, to our business as it relates to the IDFA changes, we have seen no material change in spend as the result of the IDFA changes. And that's in part because of what I was saying before, which is we have the ability to look at 12 million ads per second, If you change slightly, which apps get consent and which don't. But that often continues to happen, that we then just choose from a different set of impressions, which ones are the most effective for our advertisers. But we've not seen any material change. We do expect that we will continue to get consent through our hash e-mail approach and through Unified ID. Incidentally, every one of the big tech companies that you're talking about, like Apple, I just signed in my Apple ID two minutes before this call. It was based on an e-mail address incidentally. It was based on a Gmail address. Google's IDs and their footprint for providing targeted advertising are extremely dependent on e-mail addresses, it's one of the reasons that Gmail is such a valuable asset for Google. So the idea that an e-mail-based approach to managing consent and opt-in and privacy is somehow in question when those companies are leveraging the exact same approach or something very similar, which is based on e-mail address. I think gives strong evidence that there's a way to do it right, and we're convinced that we're doing it right. And Paul, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. The final question will be coming from Tom White from D.A. Davidson. Tom, your line is live.\nTom White: Maybe just a follow-up on UID 2.0 and then one on Solimar. Jeff, you referenced UID 2.0's ability to enable better cross-channel measurement and attribution than what's available for cookies. Can you dig into -- is there any way you can kind of maybe quantify the benefit to efficacy or targeting? And maybe the extent to which that could act as a tailwind to spend in kind of the initial weeks or months of the transition? And then just on Solimar how should we think about its impact to the business relative to, say, the next wave rollout, which seem to correspond to a nice spike in spend moving over to the platform?\nJeff Green: Yes, fantastic. I'm really glad you asked about the better cross-channel measurement. And it speaks to why one of the very first partners that we went public with was Nielsen. Nielsen has been the gold standard of measurement in TV for decades. And they, of course, recognize that the world is changing as it moves -- as television moves to the Internet and connected TV. And that means that measurement has to change. So they made very clear in our initial discussions that we need a currency of measurement for the open Internet, which, by the way, CTV is all open Internet or nearly all open Internet. And so it becomes extremely important that, that gets measured in a ubiquitous way. So unlike cookies, where there's constantly this sinking where you're trying to get one cookie ID to match another one. So Trade Desk, for instance, would have cookie ABC that we then had to sync with Google to be cookie XYZ. So that we both understood that ABC and XYZ were the same. So when Google's Ad Exchange sense has a bid request, we could understand -- have a common understanding of the user and whether that was based on our ID or their ID. It didn't matter. We had to have a common understanding user. By using a similar system that requires both encryption as well as terms of service, that makes it so that, for instance, and the example I just gave, us and Nielsen no longer have to do a bunch of sinking to have a common understanding of the user. This makes measurement better. And in places like TV, where it's pretty fragmented and nobody has a large market share, like there's nobody that has as much of the content on TV, as, for instance, Facebook does in social, measuring across apps, channels and platforms is more important in television than arguably, any other major channel. And I would argue it's the most effective advertising channel, it becomes really important to do that. So to the second question that you asked about Solimar, we're really excited. This is the biggest release in the history of our company. And just so much has gone into it. It comes with a redesigned U.S. again, which is very similar to Next Wave, as you pointed out, greater ease of use. We're upgrading cola and doing more in we're actually enabling a better measurement marketplace to the first part of your question, which is all about just improving the way that we make it possible to compare the performance of one channel to another and one destination to another. So not only can you compare, for instance, Pandora to Spotify in efficacy and cost, but you can also compare Spotify to CBS or NBC or Hulu or Disney or ESPN. So there's -- it enables a degree of comparison and measurement that has never really been offered before in television. So, when we put all that together and launched that this summer, I do think that it will be a game changer for the advertising community and for our company.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back over to The Trade Desk for final remarks.\nChris Toth: Thanks, everyone, for joining. I know we ran a few minutes over the top of the hour, but again, really good questions, and I hope everyone appreciated the change of time of the call. The numbers on the call are much greater. So we appreciate the feedback that we've received and look forward to speaking with everyone over the remainder of the quarter. So have a good afternoon, everyone.\nJeff Green: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you can see from our earnings press release, The Trade Desk reported a very strong first quarter this year. This performance is especially encouraging because annual advertising budgets are often being reset and reconsidered in Q1, making them historically harder to predict. And this year, it was especially challenging because of the global pandemic. The unique worldwide business environment helped accelerate digital advertising in most parts of the world as we exited 2020. However, several verticals are still to come as we all march up and out of the recovery curve. For the quarter, we exceeded our own expectations, and this is another positive sign that The Trade Desk has emerged as the default demand-side platform for the open Internet. A steady stream of new brands and agencies started to work with us for the first time in Q1, and we continue to win additional spend from existing customers. Industry momentum around key drivers such as CTV and UID 2.0 could not be stronger. The challenges of the past year have only served to focus our attention on how we can drive real business value for our customers and partners. And that has enabled us to forge closer relationships with the biggest brands in the world. As a result, revenue was $219.8 million, an increase of 37% compared with a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased to a Q1 record of $70.5 million. This Q1 record is on both an absolute basis and the percentage of revenue basis. As we continue to grow and represent more and more large brands and a larger percentage of ad agencies brands, we will continue to become a more accurate bellwether for the open Internet and advertising spend. When you consider our performance in the context of the health of the overall advertising industry, you can see how we continue to outperform our industry and gain share. For example, WPP's Group M predicts worldwide advertising revenue will increase 10% in 2021. Publicis Group's Zenith expects overall U.S. added spending to rise 3.2% in 2021, following a drop of 5.4% last year. GroupM also predicts digital advertising will surge 1% to nearly $400 billion. We are growing at a pace well ahead of the industry. CTV continues to lead our growth and our international expansion continues to yield very encouraging results. Overall, international spend grew much faster than spend in North America. Growth in EMEA was especially strong. We are starting to see green shoots from the investments we have been making in CTV in Europe. APAC also outgrew the U.S., which is very encouraging. That is what we expect for the foreseeable future as the most rapid economic growth, driven by the rise of the largest middle class in history, will come out of Asia in the next decade. In order to provide some color on our results, I'd like to focus on three major points. First is the evolution of CTV. As I mentioned, CTV continues to be a major driver of our growth. but it's also the catalyst of broader change across the advertising landscape. Second, I'd like to touch on identity. There's a ton of discussion about identity in the industry right now with a fair number of misperceptions. And third, as we head into the summer, we'll be getting ready to launch our new platform, Solimar. And I'd like to spend a moment on what's new about the platform and why we think it's the right platform to meet the emerging needs of advertisers around the world. So, first, CTV. With so much attention on the CTV market today, it's sometimes easy to forget how far we've come in just a short amount of time. After all, CTV is a fairly young advertising channel. At first, the early mover market such as the U.S. and Australia, operated with fairly limited supply, as you'd expect. Back then, most connected TV was SVOD, subscriptions paid for the content, not ads. For most of the last few years, that created scarcity in the AVOD portion of the CTV market. That's scarcity by itself kept CPMs high. As the market evolved, more consumers shifted to CTV over the last couple of years. Almost all major content owners put more premium inventory online. Today, TV providers are fighting for consumer attention, and there is more competition than ever. The gap in cost adjusted efficacy between linear and CTV has stayed strong. However, as advertisers embrace CTV to leverage data and relevance, CPMs remain high, not because of scarcity, but because the power of data-driven targeting is quickly becoming more apparent. Only effective data-driven targeting can achieve the value sought after by advertisers. And just as important, preserve the high CPMs for publishers as premium inventory impressions increase. In other words, TV advertisers now have choice. They have the ability to differentiate between content and across channels more than ever. And that's critical to a healthy and competitive CTV market. TV is often the most effective part of a media plan. It's also generally the biggest. It is my prediction that AVOD will outpace the growth of SVOD over the coming years. But for that to happen, AVOD will need to get better at relevance and efficacy through products like Solimar, more to come on Solimar later. Now just to put the CTV market scale and perspective, according to Omdia's latest research, there are now more than 200 million active AVOD users in the U.S. alone. By 2024, Omdia predicts that annual CTV advertising revenue will top $120 billion, outperforming subscription revenue by more than 20%. Omdia also predicts that markets such as the U.K. and Germany will be the fastest-growing CTV markets outside of the United States, driven by very similar consumer shifts. These trends are very consistent with what we're seeing, and that's why we're investing so heavily in CTV. For example, we recently announced a new partnership with Sky TV, one of the major broadcasting platforms in the U.K. and more broadly across Europe, giving us access to one of the richest sources of premium inventory content in that region. Through our platform, advertisers now have the ability to be more deliberate about what CTV adds they buy and to apply data-driven decisioning in TV at increased scale and the increased scale and deliberate choices are affecting everything about the TV advertising business. Just look at the upfront process, which is kicking off again this month. More and more of the world's top advertisers are making programmatic buys a larger component of their upfront commitments. As you may have heard, from many advertisers publicly, they want more data-driven flexibility in their TV advertising campaign. They believe their digital buys should be a core element of their upfront commitment and the networks are adapting to that demand. Ultimately, this will lead to the development of a new programmatic forward market for CTV inventory. We are pioneering this work, collaborating with companies such as Magnit and FreeWheel. Our goal is to significantly improve the legacy upfront process by using more data and measurement to make better deals for both advertisers and content owners. This won't happen overnight. It will be a multiyear effort. But it's these kinds of innovations that are making The Trade Desk such an integral component of the tech showcases that major platforms, such as Disney, NBCU and Nielsen are putting together as a part of the upfront this year. I'm encouraged by how traditional TV companies and broadcasters are thinking about this. They are not standing still or waiting around, they are leading. With NBCUniversal, for example, we're working on innovative ways to bring e-commerce into the CTV experience. So if you see an ad for a product, you can interact with it and purchase it with one click right on the screen. Broadcasters are also applying the same innovation focus to the world of identity. In the last couple of weeks, we've announced collaborations with OpenAP and Blockgraph. These companies are each owned by some of the largest TV networks in the United States. They are both working on creating new approaches to identity that work for CTV, which bridge between CTV and linear TV. Both organizations have announced that their technology will be interoperable with UID 2.0, which brings me my second point, the evolving world of identity. Let me start the discussion of identity by clarifying what we're talking about. This discussion on identity is bigger than cookies. It's bigger than any company or any channel. Cookies are not present in CTV. However, a privacy safe identifier for CTV will be a major factor in driving relevant ads and managing reach and frequency across apps, channels and devices. CTV needs this kind of approach in order to maintain or increase CPMs in a way that help fund the amazing content that has kept most consumers sane during this pandemic. The current TV content arms race cannot be financially sustained for providers or consumers without relevant ads. So you can see how the identity discussion is bigger than cookies or even CTV or Google's decision to deprecate cookies for the browsing Internet. This is a discussion about how the Internet pays for itself. It's also a discussion about control. Is the Internet going to be controlled by a few large tech companies? Or will power be distributed and will choice sit with consumers and their relationship with each content owner. We launched the UID project with the goal to improve the Internet. This is not merely a marketing campaign about how deeply we care about consumers, the quality of the Internet or consumer privacy. Of course, we deeply value all of those things, which is why this is not about marketing, but about action. It is a movement. We are working with the leaders in the open Internet to build a better Internet. We want consumers to have control in a privacy-forward manner that transcends a single company's ecosystem, and that's why identity continues to be the hottest topic of conversation in our industry. It feels like every media outlet from The Wall Street Journal to the advertising trades is covering identity these days. Google has issued several blogs over the past couple of months clarifying their position on identity. They plan to use a Google log-in at the core part of their identity solution. But at the same time, in some cases, they've been critical of others doing something very similar. While we'd like to see Google support the open Internet more publicly, given DoubleClick is one of the most important open Internet players, they are doing a good thing by making privacy a priority for Google. Fortunately, for The Trade Desk, since founding the Company back in 2009, the health of the entire digital advertising ecosystem has been a core value of our company. We care deeply about improving the entire Internet, not just our small corner of it. We have a guiding principle that informs every product we ship. What do I, as a consumer, want the experience to be for me, for my family? We enter these questions first. And then, of course, work to make sure that everything conforms to both the letter and spirit of the law. New ID is built for consumers with better content and an Internet where power is distributed, not consolidated. It is designed to operate with a clear consent framework, better explanations about the value exchange of free content and improved consumer controls. We have always believed that taking a consumer-first approach is the only way to address identity over the long term in a way that meets the growing regulatory and consumer focus on privacy. We're skeptical about solutions that lean on opaque cohorts or solutions that try to make decisions for consumers instead of providing consumer choice. We do not believe those options are sustainable as privacy conscious in the long term. They don't empower consumers sufficiently. And that's also why the open Internet is rapidly adopting UID 2.0 because this is much bigger than The Trade Desk. UID 2.0 is about a better Internet. It will be open sourced with independent government. Personally, I was inspired this last quarter when working directly with Artur, the CEO of Publicis, to make sure that their ID and UID 2.0 were interoperable. Like Artur, there are so many people and leaders across the open Internet that are engaging with us and recognizing the significance of this moment. The momentum behind UID 2.0 is beyond anything I could have scripted. And for me, it's probably the most inspiring movement that I've experienced in this industry. I don't think I've explained well for Wall Street how UID 2.0 has gotten so much scale so quickly and why I'm so positive about this movement. Let me try to add more clarity. Remember how UID work. A consumer sign-in once with their e-mail address and then opt in site by site, just once per site or at or channel. This is a significant improvement to the consumer Internet experience today, where intrusive toast or cookie pop-ups, appear on almost every premium content site and seemingly every time you go there. Some have mistakenly thought that UID 2.0 is an SSO or a single sign-on and that we are trying to build something like Gmail with the hope of attracting billions to a new brand and a new consumer-facing log-in service. It isn't. It's a common ID that can be used by many different advertisers and publishers. It often originates from publishers with existing sign-on systems. Consumers can then engage with privacy settings and opt-out directly from the services they know. While we're partnering with several industry leaders like Criteo to build a new SSO to help medium and smaller publishers, those efforts are innovations on top of UID 2.0. With UID 2.0, the first e-mail authentication provides the consumer with the explanation of the value exchange of the Internet. The goal is to make it clear and consistent. And with adoption by a who's who of leading publishers and supply-side partners, the UID 2.0 community has already achieved significant scale. UID 2.0 does not need some magic number of single signs to be on par with the billions of cookies out there to be successful. We are already seeing widespread adoption by integrating with existing publisher sign-on systems. The Wall Street Journal reported 50 million UID authenticated users in the U.S. a couple of months ago, and we have seen more partners adopt since then, multiplying that user number. And remember, we're only a few weeks into beta testing. The list of publishers, advertisers and data partners that are currently in the integration process or committed to UID 2.0 is larger than those that we've announced publicly. The progress we've made on USD 2.0, the momentum we are seeing is all beyond anything we could have envisioned this early. I'm so glad to have worked with executives at the biggest brands and biggest agencies and biggest TV companies, biggest websites to implement something bigger than any one of us. It's an honor to partner with so many companies and to UID 2.0 evolve as something that belongs to the community, and this is not just a U.S. phenomenon even though we are early in the journey outside of the U.S. We're seeing rapid progress in key markets such as Australia, Southeast Asia and in Europe with major publishers and advertisers joining this industry-wide effort. I'm convinced that over the past month. The momentum behind UID 2.0 has only been hastened by Google's latest position statement. Those blogs galvanize an entire industry on a new approach. The Trade Desk our agency partners, advertisers and premium content partners care deeply about consumer privacy. Remember that most major brands and many premium content providers have a decades-long relationship with their consumers. I've never met a large brand or a content owner that wants to ever violate consumer trucks or even just be seen to violate drug. They worked so hard to build that trust over many years, and that's why trusted brands such as Hershey's, have declared their support for UID 2.0. And because of our commitment to trust and transparency many content owners are happy to partner and share data with companies like The Trade Desk. It's the companies in the middle that they're concerned about. And that's why we're excited about one of the innovations we're building on top of UID 2.0. It's being developed initially for certain broadcast networks and it's called double encryption for publishers or DEP. DEP allows publishers to encrypt UID 2.0 and only unencrypted for designated parties -- such as a particular advertiser or partner. DEP protects against data leakage and the publisher has the power to control the process with precision. As such, DEP is an important innovation for publishers as they integrate their single sign-on process into a broader ecosystem. This can be used to prevent a company in the middle, even in the ad-serving wall garden from taking data or insight. By the way, this is just one example of how UID 2.0 allows for innovation on top of the core open source technology. In this way, UID 2.0 will ultimately prove to be an innovation that supports more than just today's privacy expectations. At the same time, it's also important to note how UID 2.0 can accelerate the goals of the California Consumer Privacy Act and Europe's GDPR. We believe that UID 2.0 best meets the evolving regulatory principles around privacy that are being put into place around the world. So you have to focus on the principles, and those principles focus on consumer control, which is the design point of UID 2.0. In many ways, we believe UID 2.0 is the vehicle that enables regulations such as GDPR to realize their full potential. Another important aspect of UID 2.0 beyond the core identity service is its emerging role as a new common currency of the open Internet. Advertisers have the ability to deterministically measure more effectively across channels, and to better manage frequency across channels and devices in a way that is simply not possible with cookies, for example. It is also in this context that our partnership with Publicis becomes important. Publicis has recently announced that they would make their Epsilon core ID interoperable with UID 2.0, and that The Trade Desk would become the exclusive third-party DSP for Publicis' core IV services. The epsilon core ID graph includes IDs for more than 250 million users and a wide range of on-site and off-site data. The ability to integrate with this kind of offsite data is critical, as advertisers think about activating their own first-party data in a new identity environment. Whether we are talking business performance measurement or broadening audience segments or brand safety, partnerships with companies such as Publicis and Walmart are so important to realizing the full potential of data-driven advertising, and there are many more in the works. Take the shopper marketing industry as an example. According to some estimates, the TAM for shopper marketing is well over $100 billion. More and more retailers are recognizing the value and power of their shopper data. Listen to almost any retail earnings conference call these days, and you see how companies want to activate their first-party data or monetize their proprietary data. Retailers are starting to work with us on strategies to liberate data so their suppliers can market more effectively in a secure privacy safe way. The go-to-market approach for each retailer may be slightly different. But the common threat is that these retailers understand that the only way to realize the full value of their data is on the open Internet. There's no point in building walls around it. Brands will, over time, always gravitate to places where they can be deliberate and where they can measure ad impressions across channels. There are some companies, mostly those with a dominant walled garden approach that believe the Internet can be controlled by a few. Then there's the rest of us who believe that an open competitive Internet marketplace is the only real viable approach that preserves value and opportunity for all participants. By the way, I don't think there's anything in the advertising world that will unite fierce competitors today more than its principle. Many of our largest customers are fierce adversaries with each other every single day. But they agree on this, and we are honored to be working with all of them to improve privacy standards and practices across the Internet. We all agree that the open Internet is the best way to activate first-party data and to measure campaign performance against real business goals with a much clearer understanding of actual consumer actions, which leads me to the third point I want to cover today, the launch of our new Solimar platform later this summer, which incorporates many of these principles. Just think about the pressures that today's marketers are under proving the ROI of every advertising dollar, which means that advertisers want better measurement and the ability to tie measurement to actual business outcomes like sales in a Walmart store or foot traffic onto an auto dealership, activating valuable first-party data in a secure way that respects consumer privacy, all in a new identity environment. And completely rethinking how to approach EV advertising, which is the largest channel for many of our advertisers. Solimar has been many years in the making and is the biggest platform upgrade in our history. And it has been designed and engineered to meet these evolving needs of the modern marketer. For one thing, the U.S. is completely redesigned. It brings all the features of our platform together in a very easy-to-use interface. It starts with your goals as a marketer, whether those are marketing goals or business goals or some combination, better, more expressive, more detailed goal setting at the outset means that the Co-op AI systems can be more effective for the media trader, optimizing campaigns on the fly. Solimar will have the industry's easiest on-ramp for our customers' valuable first-party data. In a new identity environment, that data becomes even more important, but advertisers want to unleash it in a secure, trusted environment. Solimar provides that, and innovations such as UID 2.0 and DEP will only increase advertiser trust in the platform. And Solimar is a closed loop system. It does more of the work for you, engaging a much richer measurement marketplace, incorporating on-site and off-site data so an advertiser can better tie a marketing campaign to a real business outcome. Again, think about the shopper data example. Advertisers want to understand how their campaigns are driving in-store sales. We are building that off-site data into solar. Whether it's retail stores or auto dealerships or ticket sales or any other form of business performance data, so the advertising campaign can seamlessly optimize for those business goals. In doing so, Solimar liberates the media trader to focus on campaign performance rather than having to turn the dials on every aspect of campaign management. Solimar can manage the details, allowing the media trader to focus on more strategic objectives. So with the Solimar launch, we will be heading into the second half of the year with a great deal of excitement and momentum about our ability to best serve the needs of the modern marketer. And let me wrap things up on this point. We are off to a very positive start in 2021, exceeding our expectations. And that's because advertisers are increasingly gravitating to our platform as the default DSP of the open Internet. But we are not resting on our laurels. As you know, we are consistently investing in our business so we can continue to lead our industry, whether that's international expansion, innovative partnerships with companies such as Walmart and Publicis, new channels such as CTV, major platform upgrades such as Solimar for integrating valuable new data and measurement capabilities. And all of those investment decisions are informed by the emerging needs of our customers, advertising agencies and major brand advertisers of the world. They are becoming more data-driven than everything that they do and their expectations of how they unleash data are only growing. And that, more than anything, is what makes me so excited and confident about the future. We are excited to compete for every digital advertising dollar. When we compete, we usually win. And with that, let me hand it over to Blake to talk about the financials. Yes. Thanks, Shyam. And I also appreciate the kind words. Yes, there is so much that I'm excited about for this year. And I think it's fair to say that I've never been more bullish on our business and especially, I have never been more -- or more bullish about CTV in our business. The CTV in Q1, once again, more than doubled spend compared to Q1 of last year. So once again, the trend just highlighting just how impressive the trends in CTV actually are, of course, the move to CTV away from linear or traditional television just continues to accelerate. Blake will talk in just a second. In fact, I'll let him add some color on this question relating to what that means when you extract political. But to me, the macro trend is the thing to focus on most, which is COVID and the quarantine made everybody stay at home and stream more television and also put pressure on the consumer so that they're looking at their entire TV experience and essentially, looking for value and looking for things to cut. And that has meant that cord cutting in linear cable television has accelerated, and that people are looking more and more at Internet fuel TV. Because there are also more apps than there have ever been, content discovery is tougher in CTV than it's ever been. Is it on that app? Or is it on that other app? That's a harder question than it's ever been. And it's also harder for AVOD companies to actually become SVOD companies. So they, in fact, need to sell ads and they need them to be relevant in order to be highly effective. What that means is that AVOD is accelerating more than any other part of CTV. And it means that a platform that sits in the middle, like ours does looking across all these different apps and channels. So that we can help advertisers manage reach and frequency, help them shop for value and being one of the, if not the largest source of demand for all these quality content owners means that our future has never been more bright in CTV, which is the part of our business that I'm most excited about. I imagine we'll get a chance to talk more about UID in a second. I'll talk about some of the momentum there. But our overall business stays strong. I'm sure I've left off some highlights. Blake, what would you add? Absolutely and very much appreciate the question because there's so much that has been said, so much that needs to be said about this. And despite our best efforts, I still think there's a lot that can be said to provide clarity. So let me start by just saying Unified ID is a privacy-first initiative that is -- was initially started by The Trade Desk, but it is something that is a movement among the entire open Internet. And it's so much bigger than our company at this point with hundreds of companies working on this at this point, in part because of our efforts to open source it and get the entire community involved. And because of the fact that it, by itself is encrypted as well as it comes with terms of service, it is a substantial upgrade to cookies and creates a better Internet for everybody. And that's one of the things that I think is just a little bit different about what we're doing here is that we're trying to create a better Internet for everybody. We're not just trying to protect ourselves, which I think there are a lot of tech companies that that's their primary focus, and we're trying to create a better Internet. Because that's been our focus, when we go talk to major publishers and content owners and advertisers about joining this movement and they realize the way the tech works as well as what we're after, it's really easy for them to get on board. Now, of course, you have to understand the technology, which is somewhat esoteric. But because of the fact that we've gotten so much support from companies like Criteo and from LiveRamp, from Nielsen from the Washington Post, and industry initiatives like -- or bodies like Prebid and Pram and IV, we're really excited to have that sort of support and momentum. We -- in The Wall Street Journal, I know they printed a month or two ago that there have been 50 million UID authenticated users in the United States alone. We've seen that increase by multiples since then. So the momentum is just unbelievable. And the number of companies that are in the process of implementing is exponentially higher than those that we've issued press releases on. So anybody that wants to go see the caliber of companies that we've been working with. You can see a double-digit number of press releases of companies adopting that and supporting it. I've had multiple CMOs from the biggest brands in the world say, we're with you. If there's anything we can do to help you, please let us know. We've heard the same thing from TV -- content owners, the biggest content owners in the world. So it's just been fantastic. The momentum is unbelievable. And then just two last points that I want to cover on this, one is some people say, well, what does this mean? And what does the momentum mean? And what does -- what will the world look like next year when cookies are deprecated and we're relying on unified ID and things like it? I personally think the Internet is going to be a lot better. And it's going to be a lot better because you'll get rid of those annoying toast that say there are cookies on this site, and you'll lost in one time per Internet with an e-mail address, so in other words, one time. And then you opt in one by one for each site and for each app so that you're giving them consent, which I think is in line with what GDPR and CCPA and even what Apple is trying to do, which is give empowerment to the consumer and better explain the quid pro quo of the Internet. And because I think we'll -- as a general Internet community, do a better job of explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet. I also think that data companies that are doing the right thing, meaning getting consents and operating in a way that we would all want them to be operating, they'll thrive and they're going to be doing better than they've ever done before. Cookies were actually a really crappy methodology for them to build their best businesses on top of. So I think that's going to be a lot better. To answer your more sort of esoteric or nuance question about DEP, so what Unified ID enables in part because we're open sourcing it and we're making it so that people can innovate on top of it. That's the thing that's really great about open source code is that you can create innovations on top of it. And that's where our work with Criteo and others to build a single sign-on comes in. That's an innovation on top of Unified ID. And that's also where DEP comes in. So let me take a stab at explaining what DEP is. So it stands for double encryption for publishers. And the reason why we're calling it double is because UID has already encrypted itself. So you can actually encrypt that again. And by encrypting that again, you make it so that you're effectively the publisher, creating the key where you can decide who can unlock that and gain any insight. So as they're passing an identifier like UID 2.0, and they could use it on any other identifier, as they're passing that in a request for a bid or in the sort of mechanics that fuel the Internet, they can encrypt it and then they, at their own discretion, and decide who can unencrypted which is separate from the encryption that comes with UID. So by providing additional layers of encryption, we're providing additional layers of security for consumer privacy as well as for the value chain of the Internet. Hopefully, that commentary just gives you some added color, but I could not be more excited about the momentum. I never dreamed it would go this fast. And all the discussion on privacy as well as identity has actually fueled the momentum. Absolutely. So first, big picture on CTV, just want to underline that our CTV spend more than doubled in Q1, which just gives us a tremendous amount of momentum. And that's why we're just merely breaking ground on improving the upfront process. So upfronts are, as you highlight, a form of a forward market or buying in advance, but it's a little bit different than what's happened inside of programmatic, where with programmatic, we bring so much more data to the table than what's been used to transact television for the last many decades. That programmatic can be way more effective. It's what enables content owners to have fewer ads than a commercial break, and it's what enables them to get CPMs that are multiples higher than what they can get in traditional television. So running an upfront in traditional television with lower CPMs, while running a scatter or spot market with higher CPMs, is a bit counterintuitive to the way that TV has historically worked, where you're paying a little bit extra for the assurance of it running and buying an advance, which benefits both sides. So in order for -- we think the upfront market to evolve, you have to create a new marketplace where you layer more data on top of it so that you can get those same premiums. And we think that there is no way for that to exist at any scale without us being actively involved, which is why we highlighted in our prepared remarks that we're working with some of the biggest names in television to make that a reality, and really excited about a new structure for a forward market that just enables more data to be brought to the table. In the meantime, irrespective of those engineering efforts because of the lack of predictability partly because of COVID and just the state of the world in the future, but also because cord cutting is accelerated because television is just a little bit harder to predict in and of itself. There are more dollars that are sort of sitting on the sidelines of the upfronts as well as looking for things in programmatic to buy on an always-on basis instead of having to make really huge commitments at a moment where you have less visibility. So you put all that together, we're in a phenomenal position. We're taking incremental dollars that are coming from upfront into digital and programmatic, and we expect, as we continue to roll out, this long-term effort to revamp the upfront with a forward market -- a programmatic forward market that will move more and more dollars in years to come, so a ton of bullishness on what's happening in CTV and the upfronts specifically. Awesome. Thank you very much. So first, Let me talk a little bit about why there is no need for the sort of magic number. So there's a couple of reasons why we frame it that way. And I think you're right that it is a different paradigm that's required. So we're in this really phenomenal position, which is we essentially get to listen and an opportunity to buy roughly 12 million ads every single second on the Internet. It's just a massive amount of volume of ads that are available across the entire open Internet every second and every day, all day. And so when you get to listen and look at that many impressions and then choose which ones you want to bid on, as long as you have insight on a good portion of those, you're in the phenomenal position to pick ones that you know will be effective. And so whether that's on 71% of ads or on 63% of ads is less important than do you have enough critical mass that you can apply data on those where it's present? And then do you have a common understanding of the user with the supply chain, which UID does a way better job of creating a common understanding than cookies ever did. I also think it's really important to think about it differently because we are not trying to build an SSO. So some people have sort of wrongly thought that UID is us, one by one knocking on consumers' virtual doors trying to get to a $2 billion number like a Gmail or Facebook users or something like that. And that's not the case at all. And instead, what we do is we partner with consumer-facing brands that are part of the open Internet, which is pretty much everybody except for five, six, seven companies. So by partnering with all of those companies who have log-ins and relationships directly with consumers and then being a huge source of ad demand for them, which, as you know, most things on the Internet are ad-funded, it becomes a very big cooperative where we're all working together. And it's that big cooperative that I think is a good segue to the second part of your question, where you've highlighted that some big names intact like Google have said, hey, we're the best at providing privacy-centric methodologies on the Internet. So I think that's debatable. And I don't necessarily think that simply handing all of our data over to Google or any one company is a good idea. In fact, I think it's a very bad idea. Instead, I think there needs to be a system where you give consumers more control, and you actually encourage data to stay where it is, stop moving it all around and especially stop putting it all in one place. And so I don't necessarily need a Google or Apple or anybody else to see the world the way that we do. I get that this is a very important moment for them to say that there the best in the world of privacy, even if I disagree with that statement. But what we do need is the community to come together and work together outside of those handful of companies. And in part, because of the strong positions that those companies have taken, the community is coming together in a way we never saw with GDPR or really anything else. I've never seen the community, the Internet communities that ad-funded community that basically powers and funds the Internet, come together and collaborate in a way I've never seen this happen. I've just never seen what we're experiencing right now in the way that we're experiencing right now ever before. And so that's all that we need in order for this to be successful. We don't need to all agree on everything because I don't think that will ever happen. Great. So In the first part of your question, let me just start by saying, sometimes we talk about Google like there's a collective mind that Google and there isn't. And I think it's fair to say that the way that Sundar and the executive team have managed this is to empower each of the local departments or each of the different apartments at Google to make their own decisions and act in their own interest. And so if you talk to people at Chrome, as we have, they have a very different position than the people in ads or a double click. And they have a very different position from the people in Android. So there's a lot of different opinions at Google and sometimes those that make it into a blog post or things like that or into the public arena are not representative of thousands of people at Google that have a different position. And maybe there's nowhere that that's more apparent in this discussion than with FLoCs. So there has been a lot of question made about FLoC. I do think that's part of the reason why Google has said, if we do end up using them, we won't use them in Europe. And they've also acknowledged that if they do end up using those as a replacement to cookies and not using things like Unified ID that DV360 will be operating at a disadvantage and that they will be operating at a substantial disadvantage in connected TV, and they will also be operating at a substantial disadvantage in Europe. So you can understand why that would inspire some parts of Google to say, we really need to rethink FLoCs And there are those that look at FLoCs and say, they're actually more -- they create more privacy risk than cookies ever did. And I think there's an argument to be made, but that depends on the details of how they end up working and what they actually end up doing with FLoCs. I think there's a reasonable chance they will never see the light of day because of some of those risks and concerns. But if they do it in a very basic way, then it could be a great supplement to UID, but if Google, especially didn't use things like UID, and then they did use blocks in a very basic way, which would not have privacy concerns, they would be operating at a pretty meaningful disadvantage because they wouldn't have something else that wouldn't do anything close to what cookies did, so very much an open question. As it relates to share gains, it's really hard to answer that at this point because of the fact that cookies have not gone away. And so one of the things that really encouraging is that because cookies have not gone away, which often inspires action like in GDPR, people waited until changes happened. And then they started implementing what they should have in anticipation of change. This is going quite the opposite. People are making changes in anticipation of what's coming. However, because cookies are still in place, there hasn't been sort of fidelity lost and also because the discussions have been so robust and just everywhere, it's hard to tell what's fueling share gains one over another. I will say that the amount of discussion and wins that we're having relative to all of our competition is greater than I've ever seen it. So it's a really phenomenal time to be in this space. And even though it's a little bit confusing because of all the discussion around identity, the open Internet, in part fueled by CTV and AVOD is doing as well as it's ever done before. You bet. So I do think that consent is at the core of the discussion that's happening inside of identity. And it's -- our big tech companies going to make the decision for consumers? Are -- you're seeing this a little bit in the tug a board that's happening between Apple and Facebook. It is about where does consent come from. And what we're asking the Internet to do is do a better job of explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet and then empower consumers. Make it simpler, easier and more consistent but for them to understand the quid pro quo. Okay, I'm sharing some amount of data and insight so that you can show me relevant ads. And for that, I get free content. We just think that quid pro quo of the Internet has never been explained very well. We can all look at what companies -- some of the big tech companies are doing on that front and have our complaints and whatnot. But overall, we're all moving towards in the same direction, which is giving consumers more control and more ability to create consent. And it's forcing content owners to better explain that quid pro quo of the Internet. What I just want to make sure happens is that consumers do have the ability to weigh in and preserve the competitive nature of the Internet rather than companies, especially those that are very big and maybe focused on protecting themselves more than the Internet can disrupt that, even if it's just a speed bump, which I do think anything any single company does is just a speed bump because I don't think you can disrupt that quid pro quo of the internet in any long term. So I guess I just disagree with the premise of the question that there's low consent rates, that's not the case. And I think some are maybe misapplying IDFA opt-ins, which have numbers that have been shown all over the place. It depends on who your sources are in terms of what the opt-in rates are in terms of IDFA. But what I predict is that long term that people are going to opt in, especially for things like Facebook and Twitter and these apps that have been staples. They will better explain the quid pro quo of the Internet and then consumers are going to opt in. In fact, to our business as it relates to the IDFA changes, we have seen no material change in spend as the result of the IDFA changes. And that's in part because of what I was saying before, which is we have the ability to look at 12 million ads per second, If you change slightly, which apps get consent and which don't. But that often continues to happen, that we then just choose from a different set of impressions, which ones are the most effective for our advertisers. But we've not seen any material change. We do expect that we will continue to get consent through our hash e-mail approach and through Unified ID. Incidentally, every one of the big tech companies that you're talking about, like Apple, I just signed in my Apple ID two minutes before this call. It was based on an e-mail address incidentally. It was based on a Gmail address. Google's IDs and their footprint for providing targeted advertising are extremely dependent on e-mail addresses, it's one of the reasons that Gmail is such a valuable asset for Google. So the idea that an e-mail-based approach to managing consent and opt-in and privacy is somehow in question when those companies are leveraging the exact same approach or something very similar, which is based on e-mail address. I think gives strong evidence that there's a way to do it right, and we're convinced that we're doing it right. And Paul, we have time for one more question. Yes, fantastic. I'm really glad you asked about the better cross-channel measurement. And it speaks to why one of the very first partners that we went public with was Nielsen. Nielsen has been the gold standard of measurement in TV for decades. And they, of course, recognize that the world is changing as it moves -- as television moves to the Internet and connected TV. And that means that measurement has to change. So they made very clear in our initial discussions that we need a currency of measurement for the open Internet, which, by the way, CTV is all open Internet or nearly all open Internet. And so it becomes extremely important that, that gets measured in a ubiquitous way. So unlike cookies, where there's constantly this sinking where you're trying to get one cookie ID to match another one. So Trade Desk, for instance, would have cookie ABC that we then had to sync with Google to be cookie XYZ. So that we both understood that ABC and XYZ were the same. So when Google's Ad Exchange sense has a bid request, we could understand -- have a common understanding of the user and whether that was based on our ID or their ID. It didn't matter. We had to have a common understanding user. By using a similar system that requires both encryption as well as terms of service, that makes it so that, for instance, and the example I just gave, us and Nielsen no longer have to do a bunch of sinking to have a common understanding of the user. This makes measurement better. And in places like TV, where it's pretty fragmented and nobody has a large market share, like there's nobody that has as much of the content on TV, as, for instance, Facebook does in social, measuring across apps, channels and platforms is more important in television than arguably, any other major channel. And I would argue it's the most effective advertising channel, it becomes really important to do that. So to the second question that you asked about Solimar, we're really excited. This is the biggest release in the history of our company. And just so much has gone into it. It comes with a redesigned U.S. again, which is very similar to Next Wave, as you pointed out, greater ease of use. We're upgrading cola and doing more in we're actually enabling a better measurement marketplace to the first part of your question, which is all about just improving the way that we make it possible to compare the performance of one channel to another and one destination to another. So not only can you compare, for instance, Pandora to Spotify in efficacy and cost, but you can also compare Spotify to CBS or NBC or Hulu or Disney or ESPN. So there's -- it enables a degree of comparison and measurement that has never really been offered before in television. So, when we put all that together and launched that this summer, I do think that it will be a game changer for the advertising community and for our company. Thanks everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, 2021 has started out strong, despite the lingering challenges faced around the world. Q1 revenue was $220 million, a 37% increase from a year ago. Excluding political spend related to the U.S. elections last year, which represented a mid-single-digit percent share of our business in Q1 of 2020, revenue increased around 42% year-over-year in Q1 of this year. This represents a material acceleration on a sequential basis from Q4 of 2020 after excluding election spend. In Q1, we benefited from continued improvement in the digital advertising environment from both agencies and brands. Growth was broad-based across all regions and channels, with particular strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a channel perspective. Our year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from lapping COVID-related headwinds that we experienced toward the end of March last year. With the continued strong top line performance in Q1, we generated $70.5 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 32% of revenue. EBITDA continues to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. This includes items such as travel and live company events that have not yet started to resume. Even recognizing that, I'm proud of our continued ability to consistently grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow. From the channel perspective, video, audio, mobile and display all grew well into the double digits in Q1. Video, which includes CTV, again, led our growth during the quarter followed by audio. Geographically, North America represented 87% of spend, and international represented 13% of spend. International's overall share grew slightly from Q4 and the prior year due to faster growth in APAC and Europe relative to North America. That said, spend growth accelerated in all of our major regions as North America, APAC and Europe grew spend well into the double digits again year-over-year in Q1. Our offices in Europe showed particularly encouraging results, as each office grew spend faster year-over-year in Q1 than total company spend. In APAC, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo spend all more than doubled. It is still early days for us internationally, but we are optimistic on the trends we are seeing at the start of 2021. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, the majority of them grew in double digits during the quarter. Home & Garden, technology and computing and shopping were all very strong with both Home and Garden and technology and computing more than doubling during the quarter. Automotive continued its return growing faster than the rest of the business during the month of February and March, while improving the travel and entertainment verticals still lag compared to others, but both are showing signs of promise so far in Q2. There is still a lot of recovery ahead of us in these segments, and we are starting to see potential signs of optimism. Operating expenses were $212 million in Q1, up 41% year-over-year. The growth in operating expenses in Q1 was primarily driven by stock-based compensation. Operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, grew 26% year-over-year. A majority of the growth in stock-based compensation expense in Q1 was related to the Company's employee stock purchasing plan. We currently estimate that stock-based compensation growth should moderate from current levels in the second half of the year. Income tax was a benefit of $14.6 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $70 million, or $1.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $75 million in Q1 and free cash flow was $61 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 93 days, up one day from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, up six days from a year ago. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $680 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved a 10:1 stock split to make the stock more accessible to our employees and to a broader base of investors. Trading of The Trade Desk stock will begin on a stock split adjusted basis on June 17, 2021. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect Q2 year-over-year total revenue growth to significantly accelerate relative to the growth rate we saw in Q1 as we lapped slower growth related to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. We estimate Q2 revenue to be between $259 million and $262 million, which would represent growth of between 86% to 88% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at least $84 million in Q2. I would remind you that the relative strength in our EBITDA forecast continues to benefit due to the virtual environment our teams are working in. As we think about the full year, we continue to model for an improving digital advertising environment, and we continue to expect a reasonable acceleration in our revenue growth relative to 2020. That said, in the second half of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth. In particular, our Q4 growth rate will comp against the significant spend we generated in Q4 of last year, driven by the rebound in digital advertising as well as material U.S. political election spend that we benefited from in that period. If you recall, U.S. political election spend represented a high single-digit percent share of our total spend in Q4 of 2020. In closing, while the past year has been far different from anything we could have expected, we continue to grab share and deliver sustainable top line growth and profitability, all while building better relationships with our customers and partners. I'm extremely proud of the way that our employees navigated the challenges of the past year with grit, resilience and with an unwavering commitment to our values as a company. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And thanks, Shyam, for the question. I just would reiterate what Jeff said, the fundamentals of the business are really quite strong, in my opinion. The thing to keep in mind, like you said, with all the quarterly comparisons, against last year when we benefited from that U.S. political spend. Q1 accelerated not only year-over-year, but on a sequential basis from Q4, once you exclude political. In the prepared remarks, I think I mentioned that you would take the Q1 growth rate of 37% in revenue, that's more like 42% when you exclude political, and then that's comparing really to like a mid-30s growth rate in Q4 of 2020. So that's super optimistic that we can see that acceleration once you exclude that kind of noise we had a bit from the political side. And then as we look at into Q2, reflected in that guidance of the 86% to 88% year-over-year growth that also reflects an acceleration on a two-year stack basis versus Q1. So that trend also is something that makes us super optimistic. So with all of that seeing reasonable acceleration this year on a full year basis gets me really excited, comfortable about the business and where things are in 2021, but the momentum that we've got from all the things like in CTV and the other areas that we've talked about, a number of times gives us really optimism for momentum, not just in 2021, but into 2022 and beyond as well."

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are both Founder and CEO, Jeff Green and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses and Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results could vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company\u2019s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris and thanks everyone for joining us today. Let me start by highlighting the numbers. Spend on our platform in 2022 was nearly $7.8 billion, a record for us. Fourth quarter revenue alone was $491 million, also a record. CTV continued to be our strongest growth driver as more content owners from around the world are moving beyond ad-free subscription models and offering ad-supported options for viewers. And once again, despite all the uncertainty of the year, we delivered strong profitability, highlighting the operating leverage we have in our business. Our results are often benchmarked against the Rule of 40 and compared to other high-growth companies. In that benchmark, the health of a technology company is expressed as the sum of a company\u2019s growth rate and EBITDA margin. In 2022, we finished well over that benchmark again. For the sixth year in a row, we were over 50%, all while we continue to invest to drive future value and growth. In times of market uncertainty, perhaps it\u2019s most useful to look at how we are performing compared to the broader industry. According to estimates by Dentsu, total global ad spend increased 8% last year. Spend on our platform grew more than 3x that. With uncertain macro conditions, where most marketers are under pressure to do more with less, we continue to outperform and gain share. I\u2019d like to focus on why we are winning market share during this time of uncertainty, as I think it gives us sense of the dynamics in our industry right now, which I expect to be in place for the foreseeable future. Specifically in the last 6 months of 2022, The Trade Desk started to separate from much of the digital advertising market in terms of relative outperformance. In the third quarter, we have reported 31% growth while our competitors were either in retreat or posting single-digit growth. That same trend continued into the fourth quarter as we grew 24% and most of our large competitors were posting between negative 9% and negative 2% growth. I don\u2019t think we have ever had the level of industry outperformance in our 6 years or so as a public company as we did in 2022. And it means that we can be very confident that we\u2019re gaining share and that our platform continues to gain traction with advertisers. I remain convinced that in times of uncertainty as marketers look to do more with less, they are continuing to prioritize decision media on the open Internet. With The Trade Desk and the open Internet, marketers can measure ROI and value with more objectivity. And that means they will prioritize us over the limitations of walled gardens. With that in mind, Insider Intelligence reported a couple of weeks ago that 2022 represented the first year in a decade that Meta and Google did not account for more than half of the digital advertising market between them. That shift comes as the digital advertising market continues to expand. Before the pandemic, digital advertising accounted for around half of total market spend, last year, a more than two-thirds of the market according to Group M. What\u2019s driving these two trends? Well, as I have said many times before, CTV is changing everything in advertising. Not only is the shift from linear to CTV driving significant growth in digital spend as advertisers shift dollars from linear TV to connected TV, but more spend is happening outside the walled gardens as advertisers shift spend from user-generated content to premium streaming content. I\u2019d like to expand on this in a couple of dimensions, because I think it will give you a sense of why I am so optimistic about our potential to grow this year and beyond. First, I\u2019d like to touch on UID2 because so much has happened around identity in recent months, that points to how the industry is evolving. Second, I believe we are starting to see advertisers challenge the walled garden business model more systematically than ever and it\u2019s because they have premium alternatives at scale in fast growing markets such as CTV and retail media. And last, I\u2019d like to touch on what all of this means for us in 2023. So, let\u2019s start with UID2. First, as a reminder of what UID2 is? A few years ago, we created in collaboration with other open Internet companies an identity currency for the open Internet based on either an e-mail address or a phone number. UID2 is anchored on those two consumer data points so that consumers can own and manage their identity around the Internet rather than managing privacy settings for each device or ecosystem like Apple or Google. Our goal was to create a personalization technology that was more privacy safe than cookies and better at empowering consumers than any alternative in the market. Once UID2 was built, the technology was open sourced and we welcome the partnership of Internet governing bodies as well as the broader digital advertising ecosystem, including agencies, brands, content providers, ad tech companies and data partners. We have always believed a critical mass of adoption would lay the foundation of a massively upgraded Internet, one that incents more competition and improves privacy standards and that\u2019s exactly what we are starting to see. If you had told me at this time last year, how much progress the industry would have made on UID2 in 2022, I don\u2019t think I would have believed you. At the beginning of our fourth quarter last year, around 15% of the third-party data ecosystem was estimating on UID2. This is essentially a very large sample of the entire data ecosystem of the entire Internet. By the first half of this year, we expect we will be in the 75% range. Levels of activation that high mean we will have effectively solve the identity matching challenge of the entire open Internet on a scale well beyond anything cookies have ever accomplished and all while providing consumers with much greater control over their privacy. To be clear, I am talking about companies adopting UID2 such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce and Adobe. We always said this change to the Internet required adoption of the infrastructure players of the Internet, not knocking on 2 million publisher or content owners doors. By upgrading the data infrastructure of the Internet, there is now a significant mathematical incentive for every reputable player involved in digital advertising to lean in to UID2. This is already happening with thousands of publishers in all channels of the open Internet. UID2 adoption by publishers is creating the richest, most privacy-centric identity environment we have ever seen for advertisers. And it also means an advertiser\u2019s first-party data becomes exponentially more valuable. In fact, I would say again that it becomes about 10x more valuable than with cookies, simply because UID2 solves the needle in the haystack problem that came with cookies, because advertisers can now match their customer data with accuracy across the open Internet more effectively than ever before. They can make much better decisions in every aspect of campaign optimization, including attribution and measurement. And they can do so without ever compromising the consumer trust they have spent years, sometimes decades establishing. Self advertisers take advantage of this new value. At CES, we announced Galileo, a new service that helps advertisers easily onboard and activate their first-party data. Galileo is only possible because of all those integrations we worked on last year across the data ecosystem. Galileo starts with advertisers activating their first-party data. UID2 can then be applied to ensure that data can be used in a privacy safe way. Of course, it\u2019s not just on the data side that we are seeing critical mass of UID2 adoption. UID2 is starting to change the value of the inventory on the Internet, because CTV is almost 100% authenticated, CTV is being upgraded while non-personalized ads on the web, mobile and UGC sites are being downgraded. As a result, increasingly, the world\u2019s leading publishers are embracing UID2. With CTV, we have talked previously about how Disney is applying new UID2 across its media portfolio. Just a few weeks ago, Paramount announced their integration with UID2 across their IQ inventory, which includes Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, BET, CBS News, CBS Sports Network, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Network, VH1 and many others. I shared the stage at CES with Paramount Advertising President, John Haley. He talked about the importance of unified identity in helping agencies and brands tie together campaigns in a fragmented omnichannel environment. And I couldn\u2019t agree more with his sentiment. UID2 will continue to grow as cookies become less important and CTV will continue to lead the charge here, because right now, there is economic pressure on everyone in the advertising ecosystem. There is pressure on consumers who increasingly want ad-supported lower cost options because of the strain on their wallets. There is pressure on content providers who need high CPMs to fund their premium content in the arms race for new subscribers. And there is pressure on advertisers, many of whom need to do more with less. All of that creates opportunity for CTV. At a moment when advertisers need to prove value and ROI, there is more opportunity than ever to advertise via CTV in a more data-driven way. Advertisers are already taking action. For example, leading advertisers running campaigns on Disney, leveraging UID2 have been 12x more effective in reaching their targeted audience than without UID2. That\u2019s astonishing progress. And it\u2019s just the beginning. Much more will be said this year about the impact UID2 is having on the biggest brands and media companies in the world. The CTV is the kingpin for the open Internet. And I believe its size, its efficacy and its value will be transformational in showcasing the power of the open Internet to advertisers. Eventually, it will force many walled gardens to lower their barriers. This will happen in part because CTV is perfectly fragmented, but collectively huge. It\u2019s not so fragmented that you need millions of parties to coordinate, but it\u2019s fragmented enough that no one has enough power to be draconian and go it alone. As a result, everyone is rationale enough to make the right decisions for the ecosystem that optimize the experience for viewers, advertisers, and of course, media companies. Because of these dynamics, I also believe that 2023 will be the year that every theme in TV changes. We now have premium CTV inventory at scale, almost all of which is authenticated and we will see more of a premium attached to inventory that incorporates new identifiers such as UID2. But in order to get the best out of data-driven TV advertising, you cannot use a forward market that was invented in 1962. By the way, that\u2019s the same year the cassette tape was introduced. The cassette tape has evolved. In fact, the way we consume music has evolved many, many times over the last 60 years, but the upfronts have not. The market needs an upfront that is always on, but also leverages data so that content owners sell fewer, more relevant ads at higher CPMs and advertisers get more efficacy. To adjust for high CPMs in CTV today, advertisers are asking us for a new forward market where they can leverage data on an everyday always-on basis. Advertisers have to make their ads more effective to justify higher ad prices. It takes a long time to unwind the culture of multibillion-dollar commitment signed during a few days each spring and bring the process into today\u2019s digital environment. But this is already starting to happen as media companies can no longer adjust to buy the CPMs required to power today\u2019s content arms race without a contemporary forward market where advertisers leverage data. We will talk more about our CTV forward market strategy at an event that we will host in early March in advance of the upfront season. This is the first time we\u2019re hosting this kind of event where our streaming inventory partners will be able to showcase their value and innovation to our top clients. And what\u2019s interesting about this event is that I don\u2019t think there is any company in the industry that can convene this level of media and advertising leadership to have this discussion. I believe this event marks an inflection point for The Trade Desk, but I think it will also underscore the pivotal role that CTV is playing in the broad transformation of digital advertising. It will showcase the emergence of premium CTV inventory at enough scale to provide a compelling alternative to the limitations of walled gardens and user-generated content. And it\u2019s not just here in the United States, CTV and premium video is the fastest growing digital advertising channel worldwide. In Indonesia, we recently ran a premium video campaign for Mondelez, a global food giant. Using our platform, Mondelez was able to target specific audiences on premium video content from media companies such as Vidio, WeTV and iflix. For this campaign, Mondelez shifted spend from popular user-generated content platforms and the results were very positive. Ad completion rates were 8x higher than what they have been achieving against user-generated content and the click-through rate was 15x higher. In addition to CTV, one of the rapidly emerging areas of digital advertising is shopper marketing. Shopper marketing, of course, has several components to it. Probably, the most interesting part is the retail media segment. Interestingly, the dynamics of the market are not dissimilar to CTV. Retailers realize that they cannot maximize the value of their shopper data by building walls around it. They stand to drive much greater growth by opening their data up to advertisers in a privacy safe way. Advertisers can then understand much more clearly how their campaigns are driving actual online and in-store sales, meaning that they can optimize and measure in ways that simply weren\u2019t possible a few years ago. The recently published a story about how Coca-Cola, one of the world\u2019s largest advertisers, is thinking about shopper marketing. They are activating campaigns across more than 25 retail media networks, including Kroger, Target, Walmart, Amazon, DoorDash and Instacart. Since Coke started building out its retail media strategy a few years ago, it has seen a major uptick in return on ad spend and incremental reach as well as its ability to determine overlapping audiences across more than 130 million households in the United States. This approach has helped the company better pinpoint audiences in targeted channels like programmatic display, connected TV and social media. I\u2019d like to quote Katie Neil, the Connected Commerce lead for Coke in North America. Retail Media Networks know so intimately the behaviors of these consumers that their predictive models, their data really help us identify what are those right touch points when we are able to say this is a great time to remind you that there is a Coca-Cola product for you. Retail Media Networks are another proof point that advertisers win when they can apply data to their campaigns. And because of this, like CTV, retail will also prove to everyone in the advertising ecosystem that building walls around data and inventory is ultimately a flawed strategy. As I said last quarter, we now provide access on our platform to about 80% of the leading retailers in the United States and we are growing our international footprint every month. For example, we recently announced partnerships with Tesco, one of the largest grocery groups in Europe and FairPrice, the largest grocery chain in Singapore. As a result of these integrations, measurement from impressions all the way to the point of sale can be connected to drive better reporting analytics and attribution across the open Internet. This provides our advertising clients with new measurement capabilities that don\u2019t exist pretty much anywhere else on the digital ad landscape, including inside of walled gardens. Once again, we are pioneering better data-driven strategies. Now the tens of thousands of brands that sell in retail environments have better, more objective, data-driven alternatives to walled gardens and unfair opaque marketplaces. So what does all this mean for us in 2023? From an industry perspective, we have a lot of tailwinds. The shift from linear TV to CTV continues to accelerate and I predict that at some point in the near future, we will reach a precipitous tipping point. It won\u2019t be a long gradual shift to CTV. It will be an acceleration and then a full long shift. One of the themes I am preparing for as the CEO is making sure that we have the resources and scale in place to help our clients through that shift. Retail Media Networks will continue to grow in influence in part because they offer something revolutionary in terms of measurement that advertisers have been craving for years, that direct relationship between spend and action. But partly as a result of those trends, I also believe we will see a couple of additional important shifts in our industry in 2023, particularly when it comes to how marketers think about programmatic. First, as advertisers have more opportunity to deploy data more fully in their omnichannel campaigns, their focus will continue to shift from price to value. They will always want to make sure that they are buying impressions at the right price, but that won\u2019t be the leading indicator anymore. It never should have been. They will continue to put much more priority on whether those ad impressions delivered the right outcome for that price, in other words, value. Second, in the pursuit of value, advertisers decisioning will shift from inventory to audience. Instead of focusing on buying a certain show or a certain piece of inventory, advertisers will put much more priority on audience precision regardless of channel, because data enables them to do that. This is especially important as the industry moves from a once-a-year upfront to an always-on forward market. As we make progress on these initiatives and as advertisers embrace the value of the open Internet, I also predict that more walled gardens will begin to take down some of their barriers. They will see that incremental demand and higher CPMs that companies like The Trade Desk can generate with a focus on advertiser goals, data and the open Internet. I will close by highlighting that while we have those industry tailwinds, we are not immune to the general economic headwinds. I\u2019ve met with dozens of CMOs through the first few weeks of 2023 and there is some level of uncertainty. They all are under pressure to do more with less. And precisely because of those pressures, CMOs are gravitating to places where they can be more deliberate and where they can apply data and decisioning. And in fast growing channels like CTV, they are finding data-driven advertising opportunities at massive scale. CMOs also understand that while the current macro environment maybe uncertain, we will emerge from it and they are all preparing to be in a position of strength as that happens. Most of them are getting ready. Some are grabbing land now, but nearly all of them are getting a better grasp on their first-party data. They are working with new identity solutions. They are leveraging more direct paths to premium inventory, such as OpenPath. And the world\u2019s leading media companies are integrating with us so they are best positioned to access demand from advertisers. They are integrating UID2 as well as new innovations such as OpenPath, which creates simple authentication for their consumers as the Internet shifts away from cookies to a more logged-in consent-based model. Everyone is taking this moment to prepare for a more data-driven, decision advertising environment. This also means that the walled garden strategy is breaking down. Everyone needs more demand. Advertisers want more objectivity and value is becoming increasingly difficult or other players to be draconian, especially now that advertisers have premium options at scale on the open Internet. Right now, the biggest threat to the walled gardens is an open Internet centered around CTV and Retail Media. The disparity in what advertisers get from the open Internet in terms of measurement and performance compared to walled gardens is growing every day. You see it especially in TV and increasingly, you see it in retail. Of course, I would be remiss to not mention the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. It\u2019s a comprehensive look at how Google operates including many of the draconian measures they have implemented to tilt the market in their favor. The Trade Desk has not been as impacted as much as others in the ecosystem, and I believe that\u2019s because our mission has always been to provide an open objective and transparent alternative to the walled gardens. We focus on objectively serving the buy side. And with that objectivity, we will win no matter what. To be clear, this is not us versus Google. It\u2019s the value and opportunity of the open Internet versus the limitations of walled gardens. We have been winning for years in an unfair market with some systemic obstructions working against us. Imagine what we can do as the market becomes more fair which we predict it will one way or another. I could not be more excited about the direction we are heading in and the value that our advertising clients are realizing on the open Internet because of all the progress we\u2019ve talked about today. Our focus on profitability ensures that we will remain at the cutting edge of our industry. Compared to many others in our industry over the last 3 years, we did not overextend ourselves in terms of hiring. We have been deliberate and prudent keeping a laser focus on the long-term opportunities in front of us. As a result, we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. As you may have seen in our press release, our strong profitability and cash flow enables us to return capital to shareholders with a $700 million share repurchase program. While I generally don\u2019t like to comment on competitors\u2019 performance, it is worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors contracted, our revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. I believe that level of relative outperformance, which was evident throughout 2022, is indicative of the value we are delivering to our clients, even in a challenging environment. We continue to sign JVPs with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace, with billions of dollars transacted through these agreements last year. I believe 2023 will be a tipping point year in many ways. And I expect that advertisers will emerge more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a result, we will continue to gain share. Let me wrap this up by borrowing a phrase from one of our closest and large agency partners. I have a strong sense of hesitant optimism about what 2023 holds for our industry. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Blake to cover the financials.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As you already heard from Jeff, we had a strong 2022, demonstrating another year of continued execution and growth for The Trade Desk despite economic headwinds around the world. Q4 revenue was $491 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Once again, in Q4, we continue to share and significantly outpaces our peers on the top line, delivering growth well into the double digits. I am also particularly proud of the $245 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 50% that helped drive trailing 12-month free cash flow of over $450 million. Our results in both Q4 and for the full year 2022 were testament to our ability to grow our top line efficiently, while generating substantial adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. For 2022, we ended the year with nearly $7.8 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.6 billion in revenue, representing 32% revenue growth. During the year, we produced adjusted EBITDA of $668 million or 42% of revenue as we continue to generate very strong profitability rates despite macro challenges. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the increasing value that the Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they connect with their customers across our platform every day. As expected, for the 9th year in a row, our take rate remains within a very consistent historical range, while over the same time frame, the value that our platform provides to our customers has increased dramatically. More than ever, advertisers are embracing the use of data and value-added services to increase their advertising efficacy. Deliberately choosing to leverage more data and value-added services is a win-win for advertisers in terms of higher ROIs, content partners in terms of higher CPMs and the Trade Desk in terms of our business level. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continues to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, and year-over-year growth for CTV stayed consistent versus Q3 despite the level of uncertainty in the global economy. Our shopper marketing also continues to progress nicely as more and more advertisers deploy retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results in utilization in our data marketplace as the enhancements that we made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend for the fourth quarter. Growth in North America was resilient with our New York office leading the way in Q4. It\u2019s worth noting, CTV growth in EMEA and South Asia were very strong once again this quarter. We are encouraged to see our teams in these regions executing on this key growth driver. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q4 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the impacts related to the pandemic. Automotive was also among our strongest verticals, accelerated to its highest year-over-year quarterly growth rate in 2022 as a result of winning new business and the easing of supply chain challenges across the industry. Additionally, as expected, political election spend about doubled quarter-over-quarter, representing a low single-digit percent of spend in Q4. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $263 million, up 22% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to prudently make investments in our team, particularly in areas of technology and development as we scale and position the organization for long-term growth. Excluding stock-based compensation, the year-over-year growth in Q4 operating expenses was lower than our year-over-year headcount growth, primarily due to lower costs such as variable compensation, the timing of fixed marketing investments and employer taxes. Unlike some ad funded peers and many technology companies, however, we have responsibly managed our headcount operating expenses over the past few years as our demonstrated revenue growth since 2019 is higher than both headcount and operating expense growth, excluding stock-based compensation over the same period. Because of that continued focus on generating profitable growth, we enter 2023 in a very strong position to take share and win spend, while still generating meaningful adjusted EBITDA. Income tax was $41 million in the quarter, mainly due to lower tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards when compared to the prior year, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $190 million or $0.38 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million and free cash flow was $123 million in Q4. CapEx during the quarter was driven primarily by data center and infrastructure investments that were higher than the previous year due to timing was in line with our expectations for the full year. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis. DSOs exiting Q4 were 104 days, down 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 86 days, down 5 days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. And finally, as you have seen in our press release, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program this morning. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strength of our business model that produces significant cash flow, led to a review of our capital allocation strategy. Our review adjusted investments in our business, including managing our working capital, the potential for acquisitions and options for returning excess capital to our shareholders. Starting in the first quarter of this year, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares, including helping to offset dilution from employee stock issuances. Turning now to our outlook. We have started the year with good momentum. For the first 6 weeks of the quarter, spend growth has increased on a year-over-year basis each week, demonstrating consistent acceleration of a bit slower-than-normal month of December. While macro conditions continue to remain uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $363 million, which will represent growth of 15% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $78 million in Q1. Turning to our operating expenses. In 2023, excluding stock-based compensation, we expect our operating expenses to increase on a year-over-year basis. We plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount. However, our current operating plans to grow our team at around half the rate we did in 2022. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage with a balanced perspective that allows us to prudently invest in our business to capture the immense opportunity in areas such as CTV or shopper marketing, while retaining flexibility in light of the macro environment. We\u2019re also happy to say that most of our teams around the world are now back to working in-person in our hybrid operating model, and we have resumed live team events, travel and other related activities. With that in mind, our operating expense structure of the company is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. We are proud that the Trade Desk is one of the few high-growth technology companies consistently able to generate growth, profits and cash. We expect 2023 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be around $80 million. We expect data center and infrastructure costs to the majority of our CapEx investment in 2023 as it did in 2022. In closing, I am very pleased with our performance in 2022 and our setup into 2023. We\u2019re executing to capture key secular growth drivers like CTV and shopper marketing, we\u2019re amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPath, and we\u2019re adding more value for our customers with continuous innovation of our platform. We enter 2023 in a strong position to grow and gain more share, continue to focus on both growth and profitability and remain highly optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Shyam Patil at SIG.\nShyam Patil: Thank you. Hey, guys. Congrats on the continued strong performance. I had a couple of questions. Jeff, can you talk a little bit more about just what you\u2019re seeing and how you\u2019re thinking about the macro this year? And then just as a quick follow-up, Blake, can you provide a bit more color on the 1Q guide and anything in terms of linearity, that\u2019s worth noting? Thank you.\nJeff Green: First of all, Shyam, thanks. I appreciate the question and the kind words. So first, let me just say that we\u2019re incredibly proud of our performance in 2022 and the start to 2023, of course, especially on a relative basis. So far, of course, relative to all other scale ad platforms and companies, public or private, we feel like our relative outperformance is greater than it\u2019s ever been during 2022 as well as so far in 2023. From a macro standpoint, in early January, we \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit of a late start due to the calendar year. We also saw the way that both brands and agencies were planning was a little bit delayed. But then we\u2019ve seen things start to unlock. And we saw instead of there being delayed \u2013 instead of there being canceled, there was just delays and then those have become unpaused and unlocked since then. As a result, we\u2019ve seen more JVPs and we\u2019ve seen a lot more activity so far in 2023 than we\u2019ve seen at any time to this point in any year previously. So overall, we\u2019re very encouraged by the trend in 2023 so far, extremely optimistic, especially as we continue to grab land relative to all of our competitors.\nBlake Grayson: And Shyam, this is Blake. I\u2019ll try to answer your other \u2013 your second question. Just to go back a bit on Q4 real quick. Fundamentally, a great quarter despite the macro uncertainty out there. I\u2019m really happy with the 24% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s a standout versus our peers, many of which seem to have shrunk in Q4. CTV again leads the way for us. We\u2019re grabbing land now. It lays the foundation for us when times are better. In the prepared remarks, you heard me say data adoption is really encouraging as it spins our customers\u2019 flywheels. With regards to the linearity question, just to lay a little bit more like what Jeff talked about, a bit larger deceleration in December than normal from what we saw in October and November. But we\u2019ve accelerated off that pretty consistently so far here in Q1, which is really nice to see. So I\u2019m cautiously optimistic for the quarter. Some places are more challenged because of that uncertainty. But we see strong growth, especially in CTV and relative to the rest of the industry, we\u2019re growing significantly faster than I think so many of our peers who are signaling declining or negative growth, and we\u2019re growing in into the double digits, which, to me, just confirms that we\u2019re taking share. And so even though there is uncertainty out there, I think we could be in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID as advertisers are prioritizing programmatic spend more. The only other thing I\u2019d maybe add about the Q1 guide, just want to comp perspective is if you exclude the political election spend that we had in Q4 \u201822 that low single-digit percent share of spend, our quarter-over-quarter seasonality is trending just slightly better than we\u2019ve seen on average. So I feel really good about Q1 so far, and I\u2019m optimistic about the quarter.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Shyam, Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Matt Swanson at RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thank you. I\u2019ll add my congratulations on the execution as well. Jeff, I want to ask you on all the Google developments we\u2019ve seen in the quarter. I think a lot of us have read your thought pieces on the subject, which have been really insightful. But could you elaborate a little bit on what you think the near and long-term impact on the market is of the antitrust? And I think especially the comment you made about the market will become more fair one way or another. And then if I could add a quick follow-up. There was a beta launch of the Privacy Sandbox for Android last night. Does this change any thoughts around maybe the potential cookie deprecation time line or how likely this is to happen?\nJeff Green: Thanks a lot, Matt, for the kind words as well as the question. So let me first just talk about the Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. So let me just give the sort of punchline first, which is that I believe we will win regardless of the outcome. So no matter what happens, I think we\u2019re going to win. We have been winning in an unfair market. So \u2013 of course, if the market becomes more fair, which we think it will, as a result of this, like I said, one way or another. Then of course, that signifies significantly better environment for us to perform it. The Department of Justice has clearly done their homework on this, which I am extremely encouraged by. I know there is some at Google who tried to suggest that we have been through this three or four times before. I do believe that this is fundamentally different. And part of that is just because of how detailed I think the case is outlined. I do believe there are many possible outcomes here. There is lots of people that are talking about breaking it up. There is lots of other potential outcomes. But I do believe that in any case, this will slow down Google, there is a 100% chance of that. And so with them slowed down, with the market moving towards just better competition and more fairness, I believe there is no way that this isn\u2019t good for us. I do want to acknowledge that as there is some pressure to just break up assets, I don\u2019t believe that, that alone is enough. And that if that\u2019s all this done, I think technology could be replaced and some of the same practices that got us here could happen again. So to me, the most important thing that happens here is that any settlement or any conclusion to the case ends with more fairness and restrictions to make certain that the market stays fair, especially when leveraging assets that are extremely nearing monopoly, if you will. So as it relates to Privacy Sandbox, there has been a lot that have been discussed about Privacy Sandbox in the past. It\u2019s often, I think, wrongly compared to the world of cookies and doesn\u2019t necessarily acknowledge the importance of relevance in order to create a free and open Internet that can subsidize the content that currently exist on the open Internet. So I don\u2019t actually think that, that has much to do with the antitrust case or the deprecation of cookies or UID2, but certainly something to launch.\nChris Toth: Thank you, Matt. Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much, guys. And congrats again on the really strong execution, all things considered. So I have two questions, one for Jeff and one for Blake. Jeff, can you maybe just share with us, based on the commentary you\u2019ve made about walled gardens, etcetera, what signals are you looking for as an indication that if walled gardens will begin to take down their barriers, what will that look like for you guys? And then, Blake, can you maybe talk about your OpEx or just your margin expectations? Your Q1 margin implies basically you\u2019re back to pre-COVID levels. You have to go back to like \u201818, \u201819 to get down to those low 20s margins. Is that kind of the right way of thinking about the cadence throughout the year? And then do you expect margin improvement this year relative to last year? Thank you.\nJeff Green: I\u2019ll have Blake first, and then I\u2019ll follow on with the question about walled gardens.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff. So let me just step back a second and then I\u2019ll try to get to all the details of the questions that you asked. Just want to remind everyone about the power of this business model. I\u2019m a huge fan of it. High top line, growth generates solid adjusted EBITDA with strong margins generate consistent free cash flow generation. I\u2019m really proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments for the past few years really paid off for us. Unlike many companies, either in the ad funded space or in the technology space, we\u2019ve been pretty responsible managing our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. We didn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. So there is \u2013 while many companies are pulling back or making some very tough decisions about the resourcing, we\u2019re able to say the core grab share, combine that with actually growing into the double digit contracting. I think it sets us up really well. As we think about our operating expenses next year, it will increase year-over-year. That\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. It\u2019s a combination of the 2022 hiring flow-through that we\u2019ve had. It\u2019s also a combination of return-to-office expenses, including travel and live events. But again, we\u2019re going to be deliberate about our investments in hiring and you heard on the prepared remarks, we\u2019re going to grow our headcount in 2023. But as of right now, we\u2019re thinking roughly at half the rate of 2022. We still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV and shopper marketing and be ready to capture those. The other thing I would say about Q1 is also just the seasonality of live events, there were live events that occurred in Q2 of 2022, and those will happen in Q1 of 2023. So the seasonality is important to pay a little bit of attention to. But overall, the way I would just say it is we\u2019re comfortable with where things stand. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about our growth at the start of the year. Should we see a significant change? We have levers available to us to make those changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 with regards to the COVID. And I believe the operating expense structure of the company is actually is better than prior to the pandemic when you deal with that kind of seasonality issue that I was talking about. We\u2019re in a great position to drive more long-term scale and efficiency as well as free cash flow. So I feel pretty good about that. Now Jeff?\nJeff Green: To the first part of the question as it relates to walled gardens. So first, let me just remind everybody what walled garden is and I\u2019ll give you just one of the definitions, which is that this is a destination that is essentially a must-have on a media plan. So that the owner of that destination, whether it\u2019s a social network or a video platform or any other walled garden, the owner of that can afford to be draconian and set their own rules. And what\u2019s happening in part because of CTV because as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV is perfectly fragmented. And what it does is it makes it so that there are enough players that no one can afford to be draconian. And no one has enough market share to do that. But it\u2019s also concentrated enough that you have very large sophisticated players that are making decisions, and so they are all hypercompetitive and actually hyperrational. So what I think that does is it puts a lot of pressure on walled gardens because of the fact that there is this alternative that are super competitive and super efficient. When you add to that, the CTV is driven by nearly 100% authentication. It lends itself to just highly personalized content in a way that no other channel has to deal with, whether we are talking about in the mobile environment where IDs are under pressure, in part because of Google and Apple or in the browsing web for the same reason, we are \u2013 in CTV, we have authentication nearly all the time. Additionally, because of those UIDs, we also have the opportunity for retail to do exceptionally well and all of that puts pressure on walled gardens in the open Internet now poses as a very viable alternative. So, whether we are talking about CTV, whether we are talking about retail, whether we are talking about the economic environment and pressure that, that puts on walled gardens to want to welcome incremental demand. All of that points towards an ecosystem, where more and more of them are considering bringing down the walls even the largest of them so that they can welcome incremental demand. And certainly, an environment like this is where you are most likely to see some of those changes. So, there is lots of activity considering that sort of stuff. And I do believe you will see announcements in 2023 suggesting more and more walls coming down. Thanks for the question.\nChris Toth: Thanks Youssef. Next question Holly.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Vasily Karasyov at Cannonball Research.\nVasily Karasyov: Good morning. Jeff, can you please talk in more detail about the forward always on Connected TV event you mentioned in your prepared remarks? And then connected to that, can you talk more about the \u2013 your forward market product that you mentioned today? And also, I think you spoke about it a couple of quarters ago. That seems like a very interesting product. And of course, fighting the upfront market is a pretty gargantuan task that you are undertaking here.\nJeff Green: Yes. So, Vasily first, I really appreciate the question. You are right. The upfront market is huge. But I see that as an opportunity, one, because it of course, adds to the TAM, but also because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, the upfront market hasn\u2019t changed since 1962, much. And really it\u2019s a shame that it hasn\u2019t changed because the way the upfronts work today is that you can\u2019t really bring data to the table. And so CTV is in a very interesting position right now, which is that it has been getting a premium largely because their scarcity. So, consumers have moved into CTV, into on-demand, over the Internet content. But as they have moved, the number of ads available for advertisers to put in front of those consumers hasn\u2019t gone up nearly as quickly as consumers have moved over. So, that\u2019s created a scarcity premium for all the ads. But we are seeing more and more inventory come online. And so some of the biggest content owners in the world are having to find ways to make the efficacy justify those prices instead of scarcity. And that\u2019s part of the reason we talked about that the amazing case study with Disney, where they talked about 12x more effective as a result of using UID2 than alternative means of personalization that what is absolutely required to bridge that gap between what was coming from scarcity and now being provided via efficacy. And so of course, CTV is getting more effective. But if you don\u2019t bring that same level of data to the upfronts, then you are going to miss out on almost half of television. So, what we have designed is an always-on forward market, which is essentially just a new version of the upfronts. But in this case, we are using technology to make it so that you can bring data to the table. And because of the fact that we have already integrated with most of the largest content owners, at least in North America and many of the leading CTV countries around the world, we think as we pointed out, we are one of the unique companies to be able to host an event like that as well as to build the market that makes it possible for forward contracts to be established on an always-on basis. And when I say always on, the upfront is done once a year. You think about commodities and equities markets, those markets are on all the time. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to only do it one week a year. And there is an opportunity for advertisers and content owners to constantly be evaluating the value of entering a commitment so that you can either get a discount or be assured that you are going to sell all of your inventory. I believe that\u2019s going to be an important role in TV, the same \u2013 or in CTV, the same way that it was in traditional television. But we need a product that brings data to the table. Otherwise, it cannot justify the high CPMs that everyone has become accustomed to in CTV. And of course, advertisers aren\u2019t going to pay high CPMs that the efficacy isn\u2019t there. There is no way to bring all the best parts of digital to the table, leveraging the upfronts the way that they have existed to-date. So, we are very excited about it. We don\u2019t think that we have to compete with anything other than a 1962 product. And because of our super low, I think we are in a really phenomenal position.\nChris Toth: Thanks Vasily. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Jeff, can you talk about the opportunity to go direct to publishers with OpenPath and just broadly the benefits to the publisher, the advertiser and then Trade Desk as you think about measurement, targeting and economics, so kind of this broad question on basically the pitch to everybody about OpenPath? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yes. So thanks. I really appreciate the question because I don\u2019t know that most understand what OpenPath is. And so I appreciate the opportunity to just clarify. And so from the very beginning of the company, we have been pretty obsessed with improving the supply chain. And as I mentioned in other forums, I often look at the biggest technology companies in the world and try to study them for what they have done successfully. And I find a lot of inspiration from Amazon in this, which is just, I think as a company, one way to define their success is just they obsess over supply chains, how do we make it more effective for the end consumer. And that\u2019s exactly the same thing that we have been doing, both with the ad tech ecosystem. There are a lot of steps between advertiser and publisher that are unnecessary at times and are in some cases, unfair or that people are taking more in fees than they are adding in value. And ultimately, that is to the detriment of us and the advertisers and agencies that we represent. Often also on the sell side and in the exchanges, there can be an auction that is unfair. I mean to some extent, that is exactly what the Department of Justice is filing suit against Google for an unfair auction dynamic. So, what we have been trying to do is to create a supply chain that is fair and transparent and competitive. We found in our discussions with publishers and content owners that often they are as frustrated as we are with the supply chain, and say, why can\u2019t we just integrate directly. So, we made it very clear to the market, especially to SSPs that we are not interested in competing with SSPs. We are not interested in doing the yield management for publishers. But when a publisher wants to do their own yield management, we are happy to integrate with them directly so that together, we can ensure that the auction is fair and that the pipes are clean. And as a result, we also think that not only will we clean up the supply chain and make certain the fees aren\u2019t extracted where they shouldn\u2019t be, but we will also have greater transparency, and that will actually create better CPMs because efficacy will go up. So, this is especially important when we are talking about connected television in part because so many of the content owners have purchased SSPs, and so most of them own it. So, they have already made the decision to get in the business of yield management. So, we are extremely excited to be integrating with some of the largest. We have talked a lot about our partnership with Disney, and that\u2019s in part because Disney, I think represents the largest amount of CTV ads anywhere on the Internet currently, meaning owned by one company. And with their commitment to both UID2, but as well as to integrating with us directly, we think that that sets the tone and the pattern from what will happen to everyone else. Of course, we have announced our partnerships on UID2 with CBS and Paramount Plus, and Disney and some of the others, but that lays groundwork for us and then continue to do the same on OpenPath. There is a long to publishers, not just in CTV, but in other channels that have also signed up with OpenPath. And we think that represents the start of a much cleaner supply chain in the open Internet. Thanks for the question.\nChris Toth: Thanks Jason. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Jeff, we saw a recent piece from the Head of Media, Bush, talking about her preferences for PMP deals within CTV versus programmatic guaranteed. She said because it helps me manage reach and freak across CTV destinations better, i.e. decisioning. But what trends are you seeing there? Are marketers shifting from programmatic guaranteed and saying we need reach and frequency control? And what\u2019s the marketer kind of makes that step down the decisioning path, do they tend to use more of what you offer in terms of expressiveness and personalization and getting into kind of open auction environments?\nJeff Green: First of all, thanks for the question. Second off, super impressed with how well you understand the business. That\u2019s just implicit in the question is just a deep understanding of what\u2019s going on in the space. You are spot on. The premise of your question is spot on, which is that inside of programmatic guarantee, you don\u2019t have the same amount of decisioning as an advertiser. And so it means that you are often giving up your choices in terms of what you buy, and you are getting up your ability to control reach and frequency and just other things, which to me, doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. In equities markets, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily just hand over all decisioning. If you are a portfolio manager, you want to make your own decisions. So, you want to decide what you are going to buy. And that\u2019s exactly the people that we are appealing to. Those are the people you are talking about that are in highs [ph]. There are people who want to make decisions about what they are buying and selling and especially because if you are going to pay a premium, you want to make certain that you are controlling reach and frequency. And in fact, the math just doesn\u2019t work, if you are not controlling reach and frequency, then the premium that you are paying to PMC TV is no longer justifiable. And so the math is putting decel towards using and leveraging more decisioning, but also just people wanting to be more effective, that\u2019s the way that they had the most amount of control. And we are seeing more and more of the move towards PMCs and just anything that is fully decisioned. So, PMCs are going to present the most common way that that happens in CTVs and whether those PMCs are initiated by us or others really doesn\u2019t matter. What is most important is that the advertisers themselves and/or their agency representing them, have a full decision in where they decide to put the ads. And when they have that, that\u2019s where CTV is at its best. That\u2019s where digital is at its best.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nChris Toth: Thanks Brian. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Mark Zgutowicz at The Benchmark Group.\nMark Zgutowicz: Good morning guys. Jeff, just curious how much of your 4Q revenue you would attribute to UID2? And what do you expect that number to look like in \u2013 for the year? And then how many of the large pub UIDs that you are talking about are activated in your auction? And then separately, curious what you expect Apple will do with private related this year and what Google will do with its ID over the next, call it, 24 months and how that may impact ROEs on your data graph? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yes. So first, the first part of the question is pretty hard to answer in terms of how much of it came from UID2. And that\u2019s in part because, of course, we use UID2 that then leverages the graph. And in that graph, it\u2019s still of cookies and lots of other identifiers that we lean on for now and in some cases, won\u2019t be there in the future. But we of course, could deduce the same thing with just slightly lower statistical confidence and still have lots of room to provide personalization across the Internet. So, we don\u2019t really know how it\u2019s impacting it until it\u2019s not there. But UID2 continues to grow at a rapid pace. And it often is the connected tissue between all of those other things. And then when you couple the fact that in Q4, only about 15% of our data \u2013 our third-party data had UIDs associated with it, and we expect that to be over 70% in the first half of this year. There will be dramatic upticks in what\u2019s happening with UID2, and it gets rid of much of the matching problem, but we did see large upticks in the use of data in the second half of the year, largely because of UID2. So, it\u2019s hard to quantify, but in terms of the total revenue impact. But in terms of impressions and data that are leveraging that, it\u2019s just substantial. It\u2019s a substantial part of our business today. So, this is a huge driver for our business now. And every day that those buy is becoming more and more of the case. I am sorry, these are being leveraged more and more as time goes on. And in fact, our OpenPath initiatives as well as our initiatives to just get closer to publishers and SSPs in 2023, the IDs and global placement IDs are being adopted around the Internet. As it relates to Google\u2019s ID, there is a bunch of different Google IDs. Of course, there is a single sign on. Of course, there is the Android ID, which there is a lot of discussions about in the future. And then of course, there is cookies. All of those are largely in the control of Google. One thing I think Google has done well on most of these is they have given announcements and said we are going to do this years from now. And some of those dates are end of 2024. So, we are talking about 2 years from now. I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that part of the reason why Google is putting timelines out like that. And so that they can see what happens with things like the Department of Justice litigation, they want to see how the dust settles. And they are kind of between a rock and a hard place as it relates to protecting privacy, but also guarding against antitrust pressure. So, I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Google\u2019s best interest to make those all go away. What I love about and some of the things that they have said publicly on this specific issue is that they have to consider the impact on the Internet \u2013 really on the open Internet and all the publishers that they support and especially with the amount of scrutiny that they have right now on the antitrust side. I am not sure that it\u2019s ever in their interest to see those go away from the open Internet. But I think another way to look at it is that we are just hoping that things like UID2 to go really, really well and it takes some pressure off of them. So, it sort of goes back to the one way or another, things are going to get better. And I think with the pressure that Google is facing right now, I think that\u2019s more true than ever.\nChris Toth: Thanks Mark. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Laura Martin at Needham.\nLaura Martin: Hey there. Jeff, tactically on the DoJ, so it\u2019s 150 pages of how Google has been abusing their clients. My question is, have all the smart clients that could leave Google already come to The Trade Desk, or do you feel that in 2023, you are going to be getting incoming calls now that their clients have read this 150 page really draconian treatment of clients. So, do you benefit from that in the near-term? And then secondly, UGC, so I agree with you on the walled gardens. You have been writing that a long time that walled gardens are losing share to the open Internet. UGC, it\u2019s the first time I have heard you talk about that. And I guess I hadn\u2019t thought about it because I was thinking TikTok was taking share from the two big guys, meaning YouTube and Meta. Could you go more into why you think UGC is losing share to the premium because I don\u2019t really understand that one?\nJeff Green: Sure. So, on the first part of the question related to the Department of Justice and their litigation against Google and will that benefit The Trade Desk and our clients coming to us as a result, I definitely think that, that will continue. As you know, we have great relationships with most of the largest advertisers in the world. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that there are not many that are extremely large that would move over that hadn\u2019t already done something with us. But there are some that are changing the politicians, if you will. So, meaning they are doing less with Google and doing more with us. So, I do think that there is an opportunity for that to be positive for us, but pretty early to tell. As it relates to the UGC side, so \u2013 and why I think there is a change happening with UGC and more moving to premium. Let me just explain a little bit what I think is happening with the economics. And a lot of this comes back to UID2. So, because of the pressures that are being put on identity across the Internet, there is even more premium that is heading towards connected television because it\u2019s nearly 100% authenticated. So, because of that 100% authentication that does enable personalization that is not likely to be changed or controlled by any one company. There is enough fragmentation whether you are looking across operating systems, or whether you are looking across content owners. And of course, you have to log-in with an e-mail address almost every time to watch content. So, that enables a level of personalization and pushes people towards the open Internet. While at the same time, UGC is having more supply than ever. And with less personalization and less control coming from advertisers, there is just a more stark contrast between what\u2019s available in CTV and what\u2019s available in UGC. Said another way, there is finally a viable, scaled alternative to massive UGC platforms that now make it. So, it\u2019s not quite \u2013 it doesn\u2019t give the same luxury to be draconian in those UGC platforms as you could be elsewhere.\nLaura Martin: Thank you.\nChris Toth: Thanks. And Holly, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Salmon at New Street Research.\nDan Salmon: Hey. Good morning everyone. Just one quick one for me. The take rate stayed in that consistent 20% range once again, ticked down a couple \u2013 a little bit in the last couple of years, picked back up again. You have talked about the balance of large and small clients driving that in the past. Is there anything different going on there? And I would be interested to hear just a little bit more about how your JBPs, or joint business plans, compare on a take rate business and if that\u2019s an important variable as well? Thanks guys.\nBlake Grayson: Maybe I will take a stab, Jeff, if you want to follow-on.\nJeff Green: Okay.\nBlake Grayson: So right, 2022 marked I think, the ninth of the year, where we have had really consistent take rate trends. If you look at our take rate data from 2014 to 2022 over that 8-year period, I think we went up 4 years and we went down 4 years. So, it\u2019s really been very consistently right around that 20% figure. Some years, it goes up a little bit, some years it goes down a little bit. But the real important thing to note about the take rate is that while it\u2019s been really steady, and I said this I think on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks. We have made massive improvements for our platform, right. We are shipping new products. We are adding new features. We are innovating for customers. And we are effectively passing that surplus to them so they can create value and then grow spend with us and then spin our flywheel. And I don\u2019t think there is any reason why that historical range changes for the near future. And we continue to expect that we will make further improvements to the platform and the data marketplace. And the focus is always about grabbing share and thinking about margin dollars, not just margin percentage. And with respect on the JBP side, there are just a lot of facets that go into that. It\u2019s not just like a rate conversation we don\u2019t have. So, we are incentivizing data usage. We are incentivizing the omnichannel benefit that we have as a company. And so it\u2019s really not any type of a drag because you look at our JBP as a percentage of our spend and it\u2019s been growing pretty nicely. And we went through a little bit of that in our Investor Day presentation in late last year.\nJeff Green: I guess the only thing that I will add is, I just want to underline a couple of really important points here. First, our take rate has gone up 3 years of the last 6 years, and it\u2019s gone down 3 years last 6 years, stayed pretty much the same the entire time for a publicly traded company. Important to note that during that time, of course we really shipped a lot of software. And what I have always been focused on, and we talked about this during the IPO roadshow. We wanted to make certain that we were adding to consumer surplus. I mean by consumer surplus, we mean our users so that we are giving them more and yet the price is essentially staying the same. I think we have done that over time, and that\u2019s partly why our client retention rate has been so high and the satisfaction of our clients has been so high. We expect to continue to add to that consumer surplus that we want to make certain that our clients want to say. We believe that, that is the definition of economic sustainability to provide more value than you extract and we have been doing that over time. There is always a desire to try to figure out what are all the drivers of the take rate and what makes it go up and down. There is a lot of complex things, whether it\u2019s about channel mix, whether it\u2019s about geographical mix, whether it\u2019s about size of clients, there is a whole bunch of things, also the use of data. But I think the single biggest contributor in 2022 to any change in take rate was largely just the way the data marketplace changed. And I expect changes in 2023 to continue to affect that. But we are always going to be looking for ways to keep that take rate essentially the same and increase the consumer surplus so that we spend the flywheel because at the end of the day, we are trying to grab land.\nDan Salmon: Thanks. Very helpful. Thank you guys.\nChris Toth: Holly, we can close the call.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris and thanks everyone for joining us today. Let me start by highlighting the numbers. Spend on our platform in 2022 was nearly $7.8 billion, a record for us. Fourth quarter revenue alone was $491 million, also a record. CTV continued to be our strongest growth driver as more content owners from around the world are moving beyond ad-free subscription models and offering ad-supported options for viewers. And once again, despite all the uncertainty of the year, we delivered strong profitability, highlighting the operating leverage we have in our business. Our results are often benchmarked against the Rule of 40 and compared to other high-growth companies. In that benchmark, the health of a technology company is expressed as the sum of a company's growth rate and EBITDA margin. In 2022, we finished well over that benchmark again. For the sixth year in a row, we were over 50%, all while we continue to invest to drive future value and growth. In times of market uncertainty, perhaps it's most useful to look at how we are performing compared to the broader industry. According to estimates by Dentsu, total global ad spend increased 8% last year. Spend on our platform grew more than 3x that. With uncertain macro conditions, where most marketers are under pressure to do more with less, we continue to outperform and gain share. I'd like to focus on why we are winning market share during this time of uncertainty, as I think it gives us sense of the dynamics in our industry right now, which I expect to be in place for the foreseeable future. Specifically in the last 6 months of 2022, The Trade Desk started to separate from much of the digital advertising market in terms of relative outperformance. In the third quarter, we have reported 31% growth while our competitors were either in retreat or posting single-digit growth. That same trend continued into the fourth quarter as we grew 24% and most of our large competitors were posting between negative 9% and negative 2% growth. I don't think we have ever had the level of industry outperformance in our 6 years or so as a public company as we did in 2022. And it means that we can be very confident that we're gaining share and that our platform continues to gain traction with advertisers. I remain convinced that in times of uncertainty as marketers look to do more with less, they are continuing to prioritize decision media on the open Internet. With The Trade Desk and the open Internet, marketers can measure ROI and value with more objectivity. And that means they will prioritize us over the limitations of walled gardens. With that in mind, Insider Intelligence reported a couple of weeks ago that 2022 represented the first year in a decade that Meta and Google did not account for more than half of the digital advertising market between them. That shift comes as the digital advertising market continues to expand. Before the pandemic, digital advertising accounted for around half of total market spend, last year, a more than two-thirds of the market according to Group M. What's driving these two trends? Well, as I have said many times before, CTV is changing everything in advertising. Not only is the shift from linear to CTV driving significant growth in digital spend as advertisers shift dollars from linear TV to connected TV, but more spend is happening outside the walled gardens as advertisers shift spend from user-generated content to premium streaming content. I'd like to expand on this in a couple of dimensions, because I think it will give you a sense of why I am so optimistic about our potential to grow this year and beyond. First, I'd like to touch on UID2 because so much has happened around identity in recent months, that points to how the industry is evolving. Second, I believe we are starting to see advertisers challenge the walled garden business model more systematically than ever and it's because they have premium alternatives at scale in fast growing markets such as CTV and retail media. And last, I'd like to touch on what all of this means for us in 2023. So, let's start with UID2. First, as a reminder of what UID2 is? A few years ago, we created in collaboration with other open Internet companies an identity currency for the open Internet based on either an e-mail address or a phone number. UID2 is anchored on those two consumer data points so that consumers can own and manage their identity around the Internet rather than managing privacy settings for each device or ecosystem like Apple or Google. Our goal was to create a personalization technology that was more privacy safe than cookies and better at empowering consumers than any alternative in the market. Once UID2 was built, the technology was open sourced and we welcome the partnership of Internet governing bodies as well as the broader digital advertising ecosystem, including agencies, brands, content providers, ad tech companies and data partners. We have always believed a critical mass of adoption would lay the foundation of a massively upgraded Internet, one that incents more competition and improves privacy standards and that's exactly what we are starting to see. If you had told me at this time last year, how much progress the industry would have made on UID2 in 2022, I don't think I would have believed you. At the beginning of our fourth quarter last year, around 15% of the third-party data ecosystem was estimating on UID2. This is essentially a very large sample of the entire data ecosystem of the entire Internet. By the first half of this year, we expect we will be in the 75% range. Levels of activation that high mean we will have effectively solve the identity matching challenge of the entire open Internet on a scale well beyond anything cookies have ever accomplished and all while providing consumers with much greater control over their privacy. To be clear, I am talking about companies adopting UID2 such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce and Adobe. We always said this change to the Internet required adoption of the infrastructure players of the Internet, not knocking on 2 million publisher or content owners doors. By upgrading the data infrastructure of the Internet, there is now a significant mathematical incentive for every reputable player involved in digital advertising to lean in to UID2. This is already happening with thousands of publishers in all channels of the open Internet. UID2 adoption by publishers is creating the richest, most privacy-centric identity environment we have ever seen for advertisers. And it also means an advertiser's first-party data becomes exponentially more valuable. In fact, I would say again that it becomes about 10x more valuable than with cookies, simply because UID2 solves the needle in the haystack problem that came with cookies, because advertisers can now match their customer data with accuracy across the open Internet more effectively than ever before. They can make much better decisions in every aspect of campaign optimization, including attribution and measurement. And they can do so without ever compromising the consumer trust they have spent years, sometimes decades establishing. Self advertisers take advantage of this new value. At CES, we announced Galileo, a new service that helps advertisers easily onboard and activate their first-party data. Galileo is only possible because of all those integrations we worked on last year across the data ecosystem. Galileo starts with advertisers activating their first-party data. UID2 can then be applied to ensure that data can be used in a privacy safe way. Of course, it's not just on the data side that we are seeing critical mass of UID2 adoption. UID2 is starting to change the value of the inventory on the Internet, because CTV is almost 100% authenticated, CTV is being upgraded while non-personalized ads on the web, mobile and UGC sites are being downgraded. As a result, increasingly, the world's leading publishers are embracing UID2. With CTV, we have talked previously about how Disney is applying new UID2 across its media portfolio. Just a few weeks ago, Paramount announced their integration with UID2 across their IQ inventory, which includes Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, BET, CBS News, CBS Sports Network, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Network, VH1 and many others. I shared the stage at CES with Paramount Advertising President, John Haley. He talked about the importance of unified identity in helping agencies and brands tie together campaigns in a fragmented omnichannel environment. And I couldn't agree more with his sentiment. UID2 will continue to grow as cookies become less important and CTV will continue to lead the charge here, because right now, there is economic pressure on everyone in the advertising ecosystem. There is pressure on consumers who increasingly want ad-supported lower cost options because of the strain on their wallets. There is pressure on content providers who need high CPMs to fund their premium content in the arms race for new subscribers. And there is pressure on advertisers, many of whom need to do more with less. All of that creates opportunity for CTV. At a moment when advertisers need to prove value and ROI, there is more opportunity than ever to advertise via CTV in a more data-driven way. Advertisers are already taking action. For example, leading advertisers running campaigns on Disney, leveraging UID2 have been 12x more effective in reaching their targeted audience than without UID2. That's astonishing progress. And it's just the beginning. Much more will be said this year about the impact UID2 is having on the biggest brands and media companies in the world. The CTV is the kingpin for the open Internet. And I believe its size, its efficacy and its value will be transformational in showcasing the power of the open Internet to advertisers. Eventually, it will force many walled gardens to lower their barriers. This will happen in part because CTV is perfectly fragmented, but collectively huge. It's not so fragmented that you need millions of parties to coordinate, but it's fragmented enough that no one has enough power to be draconian and go it alone. As a result, everyone is rationale enough to make the right decisions for the ecosystem that optimize the experience for viewers, advertisers, and of course, media companies. Because of these dynamics, I also believe that 2023 will be the year that every theme in TV changes. We now have premium CTV inventory at scale, almost all of which is authenticated and we will see more of a premium attached to inventory that incorporates new identifiers such as UID2. But in order to get the best out of data-driven TV advertising, you cannot use a forward market that was invented in 1962. By the way, that's the same year the cassette tape was introduced. The cassette tape has evolved. In fact, the way we consume music has evolved many, many times over the last 60 years, but the upfronts have not. The market needs an upfront that is always on, but also leverages data so that content owners sell fewer, more relevant ads at higher CPMs and advertisers get more efficacy. To adjust for high CPMs in CTV today, advertisers are asking us for a new forward market where they can leverage data on an everyday always-on basis. Advertisers have to make their ads more effective to justify higher ad prices. It takes a long time to unwind the culture of multibillion-dollar commitment signed during a few days each spring and bring the process into today's digital environment. But this is already starting to happen as media companies can no longer adjust to buy the CPMs required to power today's content arms race without a contemporary forward market where advertisers leverage data. We will talk more about our CTV forward market strategy at an event that we will host in early March in advance of the upfront season. This is the first time we're hosting this kind of event where our streaming inventory partners will be able to showcase their value and innovation to our top clients. And what's interesting about this event is that I don't think there is any company in the industry that can convene this level of media and advertising leadership to have this discussion. I believe this event marks an inflection point for The Trade Desk, but I think it will also underscore the pivotal role that CTV is playing in the broad transformation of digital advertising. It will showcase the emergence of premium CTV inventory at enough scale to provide a compelling alternative to the limitations of walled gardens and user-generated content. And it's not just here in the United States, CTV and premium video is the fastest growing digital advertising channel worldwide. In Indonesia, we recently ran a premium video campaign for Mondelez, a global food giant. Using our platform, Mondelez was able to target specific audiences on premium video content from media companies such as Vidio, WeTV and iflix. For this campaign, Mondelez shifted spend from popular user-generated content platforms and the results were very positive. Ad completion rates were 8x higher than what they have been achieving against user-generated content and the click-through rate was 15x higher. In addition to CTV, one of the rapidly emerging areas of digital advertising is shopper marketing. Shopper marketing, of course, has several components to it. Probably, the most interesting part is the retail media segment. Interestingly, the dynamics of the market are not dissimilar to CTV. Retailers realize that they cannot maximize the value of their shopper data by building walls around it. They stand to drive much greater growth by opening their data up to advertisers in a privacy safe way. Advertisers can then understand much more clearly how their campaigns are driving actual online and in-store sales, meaning that they can optimize and measure in ways that simply weren't possible a few years ago. The recently published a story about how Coca-Cola, one of the world's largest advertisers, is thinking about shopper marketing. They are activating campaigns across more than 25 retail media networks, including Kroger, Target, Walmart, Amazon, DoorDash and Instacart. Since Coke started building out its retail media strategy a few years ago, it has seen a major uptick in return on ad spend and incremental reach as well as its ability to determine overlapping audiences across more than 130 million households in the United States. This approach has helped the company better pinpoint audiences in targeted channels like programmatic display, connected TV and social media. I'd like to quote Katie Neil, the Connected Commerce lead for Coke in North America. Retail Media Networks know so intimately the behaviors of these consumers that their predictive models, their data really help us identify what are those right touch points when we are able to say this is a great time to remind you that there is a Coca-Cola product for you. Retail Media Networks are another proof point that advertisers win when they can apply data to their campaigns. And because of this, like CTV, retail will also prove to everyone in the advertising ecosystem that building walls around data and inventory is ultimately a flawed strategy. As I said last quarter, we now provide access on our platform to about 80% of the leading retailers in the United States and we are growing our international footprint every month. For example, we recently announced partnerships with Tesco, one of the largest grocery groups in Europe and FairPrice, the largest grocery chain in Singapore. As a result of these integrations, measurement from impressions all the way to the point of sale can be connected to drive better reporting analytics and attribution across the open Internet. This provides our advertising clients with new measurement capabilities that don't exist pretty much anywhere else on the digital ad landscape, including inside of walled gardens. Once again, we are pioneering better data-driven strategies. Now the tens of thousands of brands that sell in retail environments have better, more objective, data-driven alternatives to walled gardens and unfair opaque marketplaces. So what does all this mean for us in 2023? From an industry perspective, we have a lot of tailwinds. The shift from linear TV to CTV continues to accelerate and I predict that at some point in the near future, we will reach a precipitous tipping point. It won't be a long gradual shift to CTV. It will be an acceleration and then a full long shift. One of the themes I am preparing for as the CEO is making sure that we have the resources and scale in place to help our clients through that shift. Retail Media Networks will continue to grow in influence in part because they offer something revolutionary in terms of measurement that advertisers have been craving for years, that direct relationship between spend and action. But partly as a result of those trends, I also believe we will see a couple of additional important shifts in our industry in 2023, particularly when it comes to how marketers think about programmatic. First, as advertisers have more opportunity to deploy data more fully in their omnichannel campaigns, their focus will continue to shift from price to value. They will always want to make sure that they are buying impressions at the right price, but that won't be the leading indicator anymore. It never should have been. They will continue to put much more priority on whether those ad impressions delivered the right outcome for that price, in other words, value. Second, in the pursuit of value, advertisers decisioning will shift from inventory to audience. Instead of focusing on buying a certain show or a certain piece of inventory, advertisers will put much more priority on audience precision regardless of channel, because data enables them to do that. This is especially important as the industry moves from a once-a-year upfront to an always-on forward market. As we make progress on these initiatives and as advertisers embrace the value of the open Internet, I also predict that more walled gardens will begin to take down some of their barriers. They will see that incremental demand and higher CPMs that companies like The Trade Desk can generate with a focus on advertiser goals, data and the open Internet. I will close by highlighting that while we have those industry tailwinds, we are not immune to the general economic headwinds. I've met with dozens of CMOs through the first few weeks of 2023 and there is some level of uncertainty. They all are under pressure to do more with less. And precisely because of those pressures, CMOs are gravitating to places where they can be more deliberate and where they can apply data and decisioning. And in fast growing channels like CTV, they are finding data-driven advertising opportunities at massive scale. CMOs also understand that while the current macro environment maybe uncertain, we will emerge from it and they are all preparing to be in a position of strength as that happens. Most of them are getting ready. Some are grabbing land now, but nearly all of them are getting a better grasp on their first-party data. They are working with new identity solutions. They are leveraging more direct paths to premium inventory, such as OpenPath. And the world's leading media companies are integrating with us so they are best positioned to access demand from advertisers. They are integrating UID2 as well as new innovations such as OpenPath, which creates simple authentication for their consumers as the Internet shifts away from cookies to a more logged-in consent-based model. Everyone is taking this moment to prepare for a more data-driven, decision advertising environment. This also means that the walled garden strategy is breaking down. Everyone needs more demand. Advertisers want more objectivity and value is becoming increasingly difficult or other players to be draconian, especially now that advertisers have premium options at scale on the open Internet. Right now, the biggest threat to the walled gardens is an open Internet centered around CTV and Retail Media. The disparity in what advertisers get from the open Internet in terms of measurement and performance compared to walled gardens is growing every day. You see it especially in TV and increasingly, you see it in retail. Of course, I would be remiss to not mention the recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. It's a comprehensive look at how Google operates including many of the draconian measures they have implemented to tilt the market in their favor. The Trade Desk has not been as impacted as much as others in the ecosystem, and I believe that's because our mission has always been to provide an open objective and transparent alternative to the walled gardens. We focus on objectively serving the buy side. And with that objectivity, we will win no matter what. To be clear, this is not us versus Google. It's the value and opportunity of the open Internet versus the limitations of walled gardens. We have been winning for years in an unfair market with some systemic obstructions working against us. Imagine what we can do as the market becomes more fair which we predict it will one way or another. I could not be more excited about the direction we are heading in and the value that our advertising clients are realizing on the open Internet because of all the progress we've talked about today. Our focus on profitability ensures that we will remain at the cutting edge of our industry. Compared to many others in our industry over the last 3 years, we did not overextend ourselves in terms of hiring. We have been deliberate and prudent keeping a laser focus on the long-term opportunities in front of us. As a result, we are one of a few high-growth technology companies that consistently generates strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. As you may have seen in our press release, our strong profitability and cash flow enables us to return capital to shareholders with a $700 million share repurchase program. While I generally don't like to comment on competitors' performance, it is worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors contracted, our revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. I believe that level of relative outperformance, which was evident throughout 2022, is indicative of the value we are delivering to our clients, even in a challenging environment. We continue to sign JVPs with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace, with billions of dollars transacted through these agreements last year. I believe 2023 will be a tipping point year in many ways. And I expect that advertisers will emerge more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a result, we will continue to gain share. Let me wrap this up by borrowing a phrase from one of our closest and large agency partners. I have a strong sense of hesitant optimism about what 2023 holds for our industry. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake to cover the financials. First of all, Shyam, thanks. I appreciate the question and the kind words. So first, let me just say that we're incredibly proud of our performance in 2022 and the start to 2023, of course, especially on a relative basis. So far, of course, relative to all other scale ad platforms and companies, public or private, we feel like our relative outperformance is greater than it's ever been during 2022 as well as so far in 2023. From a macro standpoint, in early January, we \u2013 it's a little bit of a late start due to the calendar year. We also saw the way that both brands and agencies were planning was a little bit delayed. But then we've seen things start to unlock. And we saw instead of there being delayed \u2013 instead of there being canceled, there was just delays and then those have become unpaused and unlocked since then. As a result, we've seen more JVPs and we've seen a lot more activity so far in 2023 than we've seen at any time to this point in any year previously. So overall, we're very encouraged by the trend in 2023 so far, extremely optimistic, especially as we continue to grab land relative to all of our competitors. Thanks a lot, Matt, for the kind words as well as the question. So let me first just talk about the Department of Justice lawsuit against Google. So let me just give the sort of punchline first, which is that I believe we will win regardless of the outcome. So no matter what happens, I think we're going to win. We have been winning in an unfair market. So \u2013 of course, if the market becomes more fair, which we think it will, as a result of this, like I said, one way or another. Then of course, that signifies significantly better environment for us to perform it. The Department of Justice has clearly done their homework on this, which I am extremely encouraged by. I know there is some at Google who tried to suggest that we have been through this three or four times before. I do believe that this is fundamentally different. And part of that is just because of how detailed I think the case is outlined. I do believe there are many possible outcomes here. There is lots of people that are talking about breaking it up. There is lots of other potential outcomes. But I do believe that in any case, this will slow down Google, there is a 100% chance of that. And so with them slowed down, with the market moving towards just better competition and more fairness, I believe there is no way that this isn't good for us. I do want to acknowledge that as there is some pressure to just break up assets, I don't believe that, that alone is enough. And that if that's all this done, I think technology could be replaced and some of the same practices that got us here could happen again. So to me, the most important thing that happens here is that any settlement or any conclusion to the case ends with more fairness and restrictions to make certain that the market stays fair, especially when leveraging assets that are extremely nearing monopoly, if you will. So as it relates to Privacy Sandbox, there has been a lot that have been discussed about Privacy Sandbox in the past. It's often, I think, wrongly compared to the world of cookies and doesn't necessarily acknowledge the importance of relevance in order to create a free and open Internet that can subsidize the content that currently exist on the open Internet. So I don't actually think that, that has much to do with the antitrust case or the deprecation of cookies or UID2, but certainly something to launch. I'll have Blake first, and then I'll follow on with the question about walled gardens. To the first part of the question as it relates to walled gardens. So first, let me just remind everybody what walled garden is and I'll give you just one of the definitions, which is that this is a destination that is essentially a must-have on a media plan. So that the owner of that destination, whether it's a social network or a video platform or any other walled garden, the owner of that can afford to be draconian and set their own rules. And what's happening in part because of CTV because as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV is perfectly fragmented. And what it does is it makes it so that there are enough players that no one can afford to be draconian. And no one has enough market share to do that. But it's also concentrated enough that you have very large sophisticated players that are making decisions, and so they are all hypercompetitive and actually hyperrational. So what I think that does is it puts a lot of pressure on walled gardens because of the fact that there is this alternative that are super competitive and super efficient. When you add to that, the CTV is driven by nearly 100% authentication. It lends itself to just highly personalized content in a way that no other channel has to deal with, whether we are talking about in the mobile environment where IDs are under pressure, in part because of Google and Apple or in the browsing web for the same reason, we are \u2013 in CTV, we have authentication nearly all the time. Additionally, because of those UIDs, we also have the opportunity for retail to do exceptionally well and all of that puts pressure on walled gardens in the open Internet now poses as a very viable alternative. So, whether we are talking about CTV, whether we are talking about retail, whether we are talking about the economic environment and pressure that, that puts on walled gardens to want to welcome incremental demand. All of that points towards an ecosystem, where more and more of them are considering bringing down the walls even the largest of them so that they can welcome incremental demand. And certainly, an environment like this is where you are most likely to see some of those changes. So, there is lots of activity considering that sort of stuff. And I do believe you will see announcements in 2023 suggesting more and more walls coming down. Thanks for the question. Yes. So, Vasily first, I really appreciate the question. You are right. The upfront market is huge. But I see that as an opportunity, one, because it of course, adds to the TAM, but also because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, the upfront market hasn't changed since 1962, much. And really it's a shame that it hasn't changed because the way the upfronts work today is that you can't really bring data to the table. And so CTV is in a very interesting position right now, which is that it has been getting a premium largely because their scarcity. So, consumers have moved into CTV, into on-demand, over the Internet content. But as they have moved, the number of ads available for advertisers to put in front of those consumers hasn't gone up nearly as quickly as consumers have moved over. So, that's created a scarcity premium for all the ads. But we are seeing more and more inventory come online. And so some of the biggest content owners in the world are having to find ways to make the efficacy justify those prices instead of scarcity. And that's part of the reason we talked about that the amazing case study with Disney, where they talked about 12x more effective as a result of using UID2 than alternative means of personalization that what is absolutely required to bridge that gap between what was coming from scarcity and now being provided via efficacy. And so of course, CTV is getting more effective. But if you don't bring that same level of data to the upfronts, then you are going to miss out on almost half of television. So, what we have designed is an always-on forward market, which is essentially just a new version of the upfronts. But in this case, we are using technology to make it so that you can bring data to the table. And because of the fact that we have already integrated with most of the largest content owners, at least in North America and many of the leading CTV countries around the world, we think as we pointed out, we are one of the unique companies to be able to host an event like that as well as to build the market that makes it possible for forward contracts to be established on an always-on basis. And when I say always on, the upfront is done once a year. You think about commodities and equities markets, those markets are on all the time. It doesn't really make sense to only do it one week a year. And there is an opportunity for advertisers and content owners to constantly be evaluating the value of entering a commitment so that you can either get a discount or be assured that you are going to sell all of your inventory. I believe that's going to be an important role in TV, the same \u2013 or in CTV, the same way that it was in traditional television. But we need a product that brings data to the table. Otherwise, it cannot justify the high CPMs that everyone has become accustomed to in CTV. And of course, advertisers aren't going to pay high CPMs that the efficacy isn't there. There is no way to bring all the best parts of digital to the table, leveraging the upfronts the way that they have existed to-date. So, we are very excited about it. We don't think that we have to compete with anything other than a 1962 product. And because of our super low, I think we are in a really phenomenal position. Yes. So thanks. I really appreciate the question because I don't know that most understand what OpenPath is. And so I appreciate the opportunity to just clarify. And so from the very beginning of the company, we have been pretty obsessed with improving the supply chain. And as I mentioned in other forums, I often look at the biggest technology companies in the world and try to study them for what they have done successfully. And I find a lot of inspiration from Amazon in this, which is just, I think as a company, one way to define their success is just they obsess over supply chains, how do we make it more effective for the end consumer. And that's exactly the same thing that we have been doing, both with the ad tech ecosystem. There are a lot of steps between advertiser and publisher that are unnecessary at times and are in some cases, unfair or that people are taking more in fees than they are adding in value. And ultimately, that is to the detriment of us and the advertisers and agencies that we represent. Often also on the sell side and in the exchanges, there can be an auction that is unfair. I mean to some extent, that is exactly what the Department of Justice is filing suit against Google for an unfair auction dynamic. So, what we have been trying to do is to create a supply chain that is fair and transparent and competitive. We found in our discussions with publishers and content owners that often they are as frustrated as we are with the supply chain, and say, why can't we just integrate directly. So, we made it very clear to the market, especially to SSPs that we are not interested in competing with SSPs. We are not interested in doing the yield management for publishers. But when a publisher wants to do their own yield management, we are happy to integrate with them directly so that together, we can ensure that the auction is fair and that the pipes are clean. And as a result, we also think that not only will we clean up the supply chain and make certain the fees aren't extracted where they shouldn't be, but we will also have greater transparency, and that will actually create better CPMs because efficacy will go up. So, this is especially important when we are talking about connected television in part because so many of the content owners have purchased SSPs, and so most of them own it. So, they have already made the decision to get in the business of yield management. So, we are extremely excited to be integrating with some of the largest. We have talked a lot about our partnership with Disney, and that's in part because Disney, I think represents the largest amount of CTV ads anywhere on the Internet currently, meaning owned by one company. And with their commitment to both UID2, but as well as to integrating with us directly, we think that that sets the tone and the pattern from what will happen to everyone else. Of course, we have announced our partnerships on UID2 with CBS and Paramount Plus, and Disney and some of the others, but that lays groundwork for us and then continue to do the same on OpenPath. There is a long to publishers, not just in CTV, but in other channels that have also signed up with OpenPath. And we think that represents the start of a much cleaner supply chain in the open Internet. Thanks for the question. First of all, thanks for the question. Second off, super impressed with how well you understand the business. That's just implicit in the question is just a deep understanding of what's going on in the space. You are spot on. The premise of your question is spot on, which is that inside of programmatic guarantee, you don't have the same amount of decisioning as an advertiser. And so it means that you are often giving up your choices in terms of what you buy, and you are getting up your ability to control reach and frequency and just other things, which to me, doesn't make a lot of sense. In equities markets, you wouldn't necessarily just hand over all decisioning. If you are a portfolio manager, you want to make your own decisions. So, you want to decide what you are going to buy. And that's exactly the people that we are appealing to. Those are the people you are talking about that are in highs [ph]. There are people who want to make decisions about what they are buying and selling and especially because if you are going to pay a premium, you want to make certain that you are controlling reach and frequency. And in fact, the math just doesn't work, if you are not controlling reach and frequency, then the premium that you are paying to PMC TV is no longer justifiable. And so the math is putting decel towards using and leveraging more decisioning, but also just people wanting to be more effective, that's the way that they had the most amount of control. And we are seeing more and more of the move towards PMCs and just anything that is fully decisioned. So, PMCs are going to present the most common way that that happens in CTVs and whether those PMCs are initiated by us or others really doesn't matter. What is most important is that the advertisers themselves and/or their agency representing them, have a full decision in where they decide to put the ads. And when they have that, that's where CTV is at its best. That's where digital is at its best. Yes. So first, the first part of the question is pretty hard to answer in terms of how much of it came from UID2. And that's in part because, of course, we use UID2 that then leverages the graph. And in that graph, it's still of cookies and lots of other identifiers that we lean on for now and in some cases, won't be there in the future. But we of course, could deduce the same thing with just slightly lower statistical confidence and still have lots of room to provide personalization across the Internet. So, we don't really know how it's impacting it until it's not there. But UID2 continues to grow at a rapid pace. And it often is the connected tissue between all of those other things. And then when you couple the fact that in Q4, only about 15% of our data \u2013 our third-party data had UIDs associated with it, and we expect that to be over 70% in the first half of this year. There will be dramatic upticks in what's happening with UID2, and it gets rid of much of the matching problem, but we did see large upticks in the use of data in the second half of the year, largely because of UID2. So, it's hard to quantify, but in terms of the total revenue impact. But in terms of impressions and data that are leveraging that, it's just substantial. It's a substantial part of our business today. So, this is a huge driver for our business now. And every day that those buy is becoming more and more of the case. I am sorry, these are being leveraged more and more as time goes on. And in fact, our OpenPath initiatives as well as our initiatives to just get closer to publishers and SSPs in 2023, the IDs and global placement IDs are being adopted around the Internet. As it relates to Google's ID, there is a bunch of different Google IDs. Of course, there is a single sign on. Of course, there is the Android ID, which there is a lot of discussions about in the future. And then of course, there is cookies. All of those are largely in the control of Google. One thing I think Google has done well on most of these is they have given announcements and said we are going to do this years from now. And some of those dates are end of 2024. So, we are talking about 2 years from now. I think it's reasonable to expect that part of the reason why Google is putting timelines out like that. And so that they can see what happens with things like the Department of Justice litigation, they want to see how the dust settles. And they are kind of between a rock and a hard place as it relates to protecting privacy, but also guarding against antitrust pressure. So, I actually don't think it's in Google's best interest to make those all go away. What I love about and some of the things that they have said publicly on this specific issue is that they have to consider the impact on the Internet \u2013 really on the open Internet and all the publishers that they support and especially with the amount of scrutiny that they have right now on the antitrust side. I am not sure that it's ever in their interest to see those go away from the open Internet. But I think another way to look at it is that we are just hoping that things like UID2 to go really, really well and it takes some pressure off of them. So, it sort of goes back to the one way or another, things are going to get better. And I think with the pressure that Google is facing right now, I think that's more true than ever. Sure. So, on the first part of the question related to the Department of Justice and their litigation against Google and will that benefit The Trade Desk and our clients coming to us as a result, I definitely think that, that will continue. As you know, we have great relationships with most of the largest advertisers in the world. So, I wouldn't say that there are not many that are extremely large that would move over that hadn't already done something with us. But there are some that are changing the politicians, if you will. So, meaning they are doing less with Google and doing more with us. So, I do think that there is an opportunity for that to be positive for us, but pretty early to tell. As it relates to the UGC side, so \u2013 and why I think there is a change happening with UGC and more moving to premium. Let me just explain a little bit what I think is happening with the economics. And a lot of this comes back to UID2. So, because of the pressures that are being put on identity across the Internet, there is even more premium that is heading towards connected television because it's nearly 100% authenticated. So, because of that 100% authentication that does enable personalization that is not likely to be changed or controlled by any one company. There is enough fragmentation whether you are looking across operating systems, or whether you are looking across content owners. And of course, you have to log-in with an e-mail address almost every time to watch content. So, that enables a level of personalization and pushes people towards the open Internet. While at the same time, UGC is having more supply than ever. And with less personalization and less control coming from advertisers, there is just a more stark contrast between what's available in CTV and what's available in UGC. Said another way, there is finally a viable, scaled alternative to massive UGC platforms that now make it. So, it's not quite \u2013 it doesn't give the same luxury to be draconian in those UGC platforms as you could be elsewhere. Okay. I guess the only thing that I will add is, I just want to underline a couple of really important points here. First, our take rate has gone up 3 years of the last 6 years, and it's gone down 3 years last 6 years, stayed pretty much the same the entire time for a publicly traded company. Important to note that during that time, of course we really shipped a lot of software. And what I have always been focused on, and we talked about this during the IPO roadshow. We wanted to make certain that we were adding to consumer surplus. I mean by consumer surplus, we mean our users so that we are giving them more and yet the price is essentially staying the same. I think we have done that over time, and that's partly why our client retention rate has been so high and the satisfaction of our clients has been so high. We expect to continue to add to that consumer surplus that we want to make certain that our clients want to say. We believe that, that is the definition of economic sustainability to provide more value than you extract and we have been doing that over time. There is always a desire to try to figure out what are all the drivers of the take rate and what makes it go up and down. There is a lot of complex things, whether it's about channel mix, whether it's about geographical mix, whether it's about size of clients, there is a whole bunch of things, also the use of data. But I think the single biggest contributor in 2022 to any change in take rate was largely just the way the data marketplace changed. And I expect changes in 2023 to continue to affect that. But we are always going to be looking for ways to keep that take rate essentially the same and increase the consumer surplus so that we spend the flywheel because at the end of the day, we are trying to grab land."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As you already heard from Jeff, we had a strong 2022, demonstrating another year of continued execution and growth for The Trade Desk despite economic headwinds around the world. Q4 revenue was $491 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Once again, in Q4, we continue to share and significantly outpaces our peers on the top line, delivering growth well into the double digits. I am also particularly proud of the $245 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 50% that helped drive trailing 12-month free cash flow of over $450 million. Our results in both Q4 and for the full year 2022 were testament to our ability to grow our top line efficiently, while generating substantial adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. For 2022, we ended the year with nearly $7.8 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.6 billion in revenue, representing 32% revenue growth. During the year, we produced adjusted EBITDA of $668 million or 42% of revenue as we continue to generate very strong profitability rates despite macro challenges. Our results reflect the ongoing strength of programmatic advertising and the increasing value that the Trade Desk provides thousands of agencies and brands as they connect with their customers across our platform every day. As expected, for the 9th year in a row, our take rate remains within a very consistent historical range, while over the same time frame, the value that our platform provides to our customers has increased dramatically. More than ever, advertisers are embracing the use of data and value-added services to increase their advertising efficacy. Deliberately choosing to leverage more data and value-added services is a win-win for advertisers in terms of higher ROIs, content partners in terms of higher CPMs and the Trade Desk in terms of our business level. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open Internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry as we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continues to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, and year-over-year growth for CTV stayed consistent versus Q3 despite the level of uncertainty in the global economy. Our shopper marketing also continues to progress nicely as more and more advertisers deploy retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results in utilization in our data marketplace as the enhancements that we made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend for the fourth quarter. Growth in North America was resilient with our New York office leading the way in Q4. It's worth noting, CTV growth in EMEA and South Asia were very strong once again this quarter. We are encouraged to see our teams in these regions executing on this key growth driver. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q4 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the impacts related to the pandemic. Automotive was also among our strongest verticals, accelerated to its highest year-over-year quarterly growth rate in 2022 as a result of winning new business and the easing of supply chain challenges across the industry. Additionally, as expected, political election spend about doubled quarter-over-quarter, representing a low single-digit percent of spend in Q4. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $263 million, up 22% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to prudently make investments in our team, particularly in areas of technology and development as we scale and position the organization for long-term growth. Excluding stock-based compensation, the year-over-year growth in Q4 operating expenses was lower than our year-over-year headcount growth, primarily due to lower costs such as variable compensation, the timing of fixed marketing investments and employer taxes. Unlike some ad funded peers and many technology companies, however, we have responsibly managed our headcount operating expenses over the past few years as our demonstrated revenue growth since 2019 is higher than both headcount and operating expense growth, excluding stock-based compensation over the same period. Because of that continued focus on generating profitable growth, we enter 2023 in a very strong position to take share and win spend, while still generating meaningful adjusted EBITDA. Income tax was $41 million in the quarter, mainly due to lower tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards when compared to the prior year, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $190 million or $0.38 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million and free cash flow was $123 million in Q4. CapEx during the quarter was driven primarily by data center and infrastructure investments that were higher than the previous year due to timing was in line with our expectations for the full year. I would like to remind you that the timing of cash collections and payments can significantly impact cash from operating activities and free cash flow results on a quarterly basis. DSOs exiting Q4 were 104 days, down 3 days from a year ago. DPOs were 86 days, down 5 days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. And finally, as you have seen in our press release, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program this morning. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strength of our business model that produces significant cash flow, led to a review of our capital allocation strategy. Our review adjusted investments in our business, including managing our working capital, the potential for acquisitions and options for returning excess capital to our shareholders. Starting in the first quarter of this year, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares, including helping to offset dilution from employee stock issuances. Turning now to our outlook. We have started the year with good momentum. For the first 6 weeks of the quarter, spend growth has increased on a year-over-year basis each week, demonstrating consistent acceleration of a bit slower-than-normal month of December. While macro conditions continue to remain uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $363 million, which will represent growth of 15% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $78 million in Q1. Turning to our operating expenses. In 2023, excluding stock-based compensation, we expect our operating expenses to increase on a year-over-year basis. We plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount. However, our current operating plans to grow our team at around half the rate we did in 2022. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage with a balanced perspective that allows us to prudently invest in our business to capture the immense opportunity in areas such as CTV or shopper marketing, while retaining flexibility in light of the macro environment. We're also happy to say that most of our teams around the world are now back to working in-person in our hybrid operating model, and we have resumed live team events, travel and other related activities. With that in mind, our operating expense structure of the company is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. We are proud that the Trade Desk is one of the few high-growth technology companies consistently able to generate growth, profits and cash. We expect 2023 capital expenditures and capitalized software investments to be around $80 million. We expect data center and infrastructure costs to the majority of our CapEx investment in 2023 as it did in 2022. In closing, I am very pleased with our performance in 2022 and our setup into 2023. We're executing to capture key secular growth drivers like CTV and shopper marketing, we're amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPath, and we're adding more value for our customers with continuous innovation of our platform. We enter 2023 in a strong position to grow and gain more share, continue to focus on both growth and profitability and remain highly optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. And Shyam, this is Blake. I'll try to answer your other \u2013 your second question. Just to go back a bit on Q4 real quick. Fundamentally, a great quarter despite the macro uncertainty out there. I'm really happy with the 24% year-over-year growth. It's a standout versus our peers, many of which seem to have shrunk in Q4. CTV again leads the way for us. We're grabbing land now. It lays the foundation for us when times are better. In the prepared remarks, you heard me say data adoption is really encouraging as it spins our customers' flywheels. With regards to the linearity question, just to lay a little bit more like what Jeff talked about, a bit larger deceleration in December than normal from what we saw in October and November. But we've accelerated off that pretty consistently so far here in Q1, which is really nice to see. So I'm cautiously optimistic for the quarter. Some places are more challenged because of that uncertainty. But we see strong growth, especially in CTV and relative to the rest of the industry, we're growing significantly faster than I think so many of our peers who are signaling declining or negative growth, and we're growing in into the double digits, which, to me, just confirms that we're taking share. And so even though there is uncertainty out there, I think we could be in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID as advertisers are prioritizing programmatic spend more. The only other thing I'd maybe add about the Q1 guide, just want to comp perspective is if you exclude the political election spend that we had in Q4 \u201822 that low single-digit percent share of spend, our quarter-over-quarter seasonality is trending just slightly better than we've seen on average. So I feel really good about Q1 so far, and I'm optimistic about the quarter. Thank you, Jeff. So let me just step back a second and then I'll try to get to all the details of the questions that you asked. Just want to remind everyone about the power of this business model. I'm a huge fan of it. High top line, growth generates solid adjusted EBITDA with strong margins generate consistent free cash flow generation. I'm really proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments for the past few years really paid off for us. Unlike many companies, either in the ad funded space or in the technology space, we've been pretty responsible managing our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. We didn't get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. So there is \u2013 while many companies are pulling back or making some very tough decisions about the resourcing, we're able to say the core grab share, combine that with actually growing into the double digit contracting. I think it sets us up really well. As we think about our operating expenses next year, it will increase year-over-year. That's a combination of a couple of things. It's a combination of the 2022 hiring flow-through that we've had. It's also a combination of return-to-office expenses, including travel and live events. But again, we're going to be deliberate about our investments in hiring and you heard on the prepared remarks, we're going to grow our headcount in 2023. But as of right now, we're thinking roughly at half the rate of 2022. We still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV and shopper marketing and be ready to capture those. The other thing I would say about Q1 is also just the seasonality of live events, there were live events that occurred in Q2 of 2022, and those will happen in Q1 of 2023. So the seasonality is important to pay a little bit of attention to. But overall, the way I would just say it is we're comfortable with where things stand. I'm cautiously optimistic about our growth at the start of the year. Should we see a significant change? We have levers available to us to make those changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 with regards to the COVID. And I believe the operating expense structure of the company is actually is better than prior to the pandemic when you deal with that kind of seasonality issue that I was talking about. We're in a great position to drive more long-term scale and efficiency as well as free cash flow. So I feel pretty good about that. Now Jeff? Maybe I will take a stab, Jeff, if you want to follow-on. So right, 2022 marked I think, the ninth of the year, where we have had really consistent take rate trends. If you look at our take rate data from 2014 to 2022 over that 8-year period, I think we went up 4 years and we went down 4 years. So, it's really been very consistently right around that 20% figure. Some years, it goes up a little bit, some years it goes down a little bit. But the real important thing to note about the take rate is that while it's been really steady, and I said this I think on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks. We have made massive improvements for our platform, right. We are shipping new products. We are adding new features. We are innovating for customers. And we are effectively passing that surplus to them so they can create value and then grow spend with us and then spin our flywheel. And I don't think there is any reason why that historical range changes for the near future. And we continue to expect that we will make further improvements to the platform and the data marketplace. And the focus is always about grabbing share and thinking about margin dollars, not just margin percentage. And with respect on the JBP side, there are just a lot of facets that go into that. It's not just like a rate conversation we don't have. So, we are incentivizing data usage. We are incentivizing the omnichannel benefit that we have as a company. And so it's really not any type of a drag because you look at our JBP as a percentage of our spend and it's been growing pretty nicely. And we went through a little bit of that in our Investor Day presentation in late last year."

Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company\u2019s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. As Chris mentioned, I am thrilled to be speaking with you today from our Singapore office, our South Asia headquarters. This is the first time that I have been in Asia since January of 2020 due to the global pandemic. And it\u2019s been great to reconnect with our team, our clients and our partners here in-person this week. Asia as a whole is crucial to our long-term growth and it\u2019s always inspiring to spend time here, more on that later, but first, on to our results. As you have seen in the release, The Trade Desk posted another very strong quarter with revenue growth up 31% year-over-year. We continue to gain share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Throughout 2022 and in particular, in Q3, The Trade Desk has significantly outperformed seemingly all other forms of digital with a significant contrast to walled gardens in our ability to win advertising budgets. It is very clear that under the current operating conditions, we are significantly outpacing the market regardless of the macro environment. Our vision and business strategy continues to be validated by our advertising clients. Nearly every single major advertiser wants a world where the open Internet thrives, where competition and price discovery thrive. They want great measurement that works across the web so that they can compare the performance of each site, app or destination to all the others. They want an Internet where relative value can be found as we have predicted CTV is a catalyst for massive change on the Internet, when possible, the power balance is shifting to the open Internet away from opaque walled gardens and systems that aren\u2019t comparable to others. In short, more and more, our clients embrace the value of the open internet compared to the limitations of walled gardens and they are embracing The Trade Desk as the default platform to execute on the open Internet. This is resulting in closer relationships with the largest brands and agencies in the world. Our client relationships are stronger than ever, because they are based on shared values and goals, a strong buy-side roadmap and Internet where relative value and objective measurement can thrive with data-driven empowerment for brands and advertisers rather than a tech company who is just asking the brand or agency to outsource media buying to them and send their first-party data down a one-way street. Because of this contrast, we are signing joint business plans with brands at a record pace. Some of the largest JBPs signed this year represent spend of over $1 billion in the future. In this way, not only do these JBPs position the Trade Desk for future growth, but they also create an environment for joint programmatic innovation. JBPs represent strong alignment with brands that only come as a result of not owning media, whether it\u2019s decision CTV, new approaches to identity, unleashing first-party data, advanced data and retail marketplaces, our clients are working with us to pioneer the future of digital advertising. With this context, hopefully, you can see why we continue to outperform the industry and gain share and why we are confident that our future growth outpaces the projections of almost everyone else in our industry. Just one more data point on the market overall and how we are performing. WPP\u2019s GroupM predictive worldwide advertising will increase 8.4% in 2022 and we are growing at more than 3x that rate. CTV continues to be a key growth driver and our shopper marketing initiatives are yielding very encouraging results. While still early, it\u2019s only our third full quarter total shopper marketing spend increased nearly 3x from Q2 to Q3. As we said at Investor Day, we believe that more than 80% of the largest retailers in the United States partner with The Trade Desk and more of the world\u2019s leading retailers are also now following suit. The chorus of retailers making retail measurement available is furthering the power and benefits of an open competitive Internet, while CTV maybe the biggest force of change for the open Internet, perhaps retail media and its accompanying data is a close second. Political also continues to perform well. Mid-term election \u2013 over mid-term election, we have exponentially grown our business. We are proud of the work we do in political advertising, particularly our focus on helping provide a better advertising process for all political candidates. We are an objective and independent platform open to registered candidates on both sides. With all of this in mind, I believe that through the first 9 months of the year, we have gained more market share, grabbed more land than at any point in our history. To provide more color on why, I\u2019d like to touch on three areas. First is the growing importance of programmatic on the open Internet even in a volatile macro environment; second is the transformational role of CTV and showcasing that value; and last is the critical mass of support that is growing around Unified ID 2.0. And why this is so important in building the new identity fabric of the Internet. So first, in terms of the macro environment, increasingly, advertisers view programmatic as one of the most effective ways to drive relevance and differentiation, especially in times of market volatility. And perhaps even more importantly, they believe that the open Internet is the best place to create that value compared to the limitations of the walled gardens. You only have to look at a couple of comments made by the CFO of P&G during the most recent earnings call a couple of weeks ago. As you may know, Procter & Gamble is one of the world\u2019s largest and most progressive advertisers. He said, and I quote, \u201cit is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear non-targeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend. That is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it. We now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the U.S. or in Europe, but around the world and that is allowing us to drive significant productivity while increasing reach while increasing quality of reach and while more precisely targeting our consumers.\u201d Back in early 2020, as we entered that short-lived COVID dip, I talked about how easy it was for large brands to turn off programmatic with the first hint of uncertainty. But what you are hearing from P&G there and what I hear from major brands around the world everyday now is that programmatic is a central and critical component of any campaign. The world\u2019s most sophisticated advertisers understand that as they get more pressure from their CFOs to demonstrate the value and return of every advertising dollar, one of the best places to do that is on our platform. We provide objective transparent measurement. We provide precision and relevance. We allow advertisers to optimize based on real-time performance and we provide access to the world\u2019s most advanced data marketplace including many of the world\u2019s biggest retailers. CMOs and CFOs are carefully watching costs and spend at this moment. It is why we are particularly excited by the growth on our platform this quarter. This moment is also a time when advertisers have clear goals and our objective partnership is really important to them achieving those goals. We recently ran a campaign for Clarence, one of the world\u2019s largest multinational cosmetic companies. They wanted to reach career women with a specific new product in the UK. They wanted to do it cost effectively with minimal waste with optimal precision. Using our platform, they were able to launch a multi-channel campaign, including mobile, CTV, digital out-of-home and audio. They were able to pivot based on channel performance and retarget based on engagement. As a result, they were able to drive significant new traffic to their website, 8% of whom purchased the product, driving an exponential sales increase, all as part of a highly decisioned campaign that was automatically optimized on the fly to maximize performance and minimize waste. In an environment with ROI scrutiny of every advertising dollar this is exactly the kind of campaign optimization that CMOs are looking for. And as a result, they are increasingly gravitating to our platform. Nowhere is this more apparent than CTV, the second area I want to cover. Once again, CTV was our fastest growing channel and it has rapidly become our largest. For years now, we have been talking about how the English-speaking markets have been leading the adoption of CTV advertising. The U.S. and Australia have been great leaders and case studies for the world, both benefiting from the fragmented and competitive nature of content in their markets, but now CTV adoption is going global. Perhaps the most bullish statement I will make this year is that our CTV spend grew in the majority of our international markets faster than it did in the United States. I have said previously that the U.S. and Australia are leading the way on CTV and that markets like the UK and France are following fast, but that pace is picking up in all corners of the world, especially as advertisers look for more relevance and precision in their biggest campaign category. Let me give you a couple of quick examples. When Mercedes launched a new C-class model in Australia this year, they wanted to lift brand awareness among the key demographics. Working with us, they were able to deploy a CTV strategy that reached 1.5 million households with precision and which ultimately increased brand awareness 11% among their key targets. ViewSonic is a multinational electronics company headquartered in Taiwan. They wanted to launch a new monitor aimed at gamers in key markets such as India, the Philippines, Germany and UK. Working with us, they launched a CTV campaign, which was constantly optimized via Koa on our platform letting them iterate based on campaign performance and engagement. They saw significant improvements in all aspects of the campaign performance from reach to cost effectiveness compared to industry benchmarks. They were also able to link thousands of new engagements on their product website directly to the campaign. Back in the U.S., Lexus wanted to reach a new generation of millennial buyers for their luxury cars most of whom have abandoned linear TV and moved in mass to streaming platforms. They were able to target key audiences with little to no waste and effective frequency management. They were able to reach 15 million potential new customers driving 5x more website traffic than the previous year, with an astonishing 67% improvement in purchase intent among key targets. Our success in CTV is multifaceted. On our platform, we have built the optimization tools that enable advertisers to drive these kind of results with precision as part of an omnichannel strategy. But on the inventory side, we have developed very close working partnerships with pretty much every premium CTV provider worldwide. While much has been said about Netflix moving to advertising and we are excited about what that opportunity means for our industry and our business, there are many leading content providers that are driving innovation in CTV. Not enough has been said in recent months about what is happening from the content creators who have long histories in advertising and what they are doing to continue to innovate. Disney will launch advertising on the Disney+ platform in December and they are incredibly progressive in how they are enabling advertisers to leverage their own first-party data via UID2. We are very proud to be their partner. Transaction volume will grow over time and their standards on ad load and the use of UID2 will put pressure on the rest of the industry to think about CTV in a way that maximizes advertiser value and optimizes the consumers\u2019 experience. Peacock is one of our longest standing CTV partners. As with many broadcasters who begin the CTV journey, much of our work with them was initially in a fixed price context, testing the market. But I am thrilled to report today the vast majority of Peacock inventory that flows through our system is fully decisioned and biddable. And as a result, CPMs have increased significantly, while advertisers are spending more and of course, seeing more value. CTV providers that understand the benefits and gains of fully biddable and decisioned inventory will win over time. They will maximize revenue by helping advertisers drive precision and relevance. UID2 is rapidly emerging as a key new CTV identity currency as I predicted it would. Let\u2019s remember that cookies are not present in CTV. There is nothing about the role of UID2 in CTV that is a response to the deprecation of cookies. Rather, it is recognition among CTV leaders that they need a way to provide advertisers with relevance in a way that protects consumer privacy as part of omnichannel campaigns. One of the first CTV platforms to embrace UID2 was Fubo and the results they have seen have been incredibly impressive. Fubo itself has seen ad revenues on our platform increase 113% faster than impression growth. Advertising spend on Fubo on our platform has increased more than 60% and CPMs are up significantly. And with UID2, they are also able to deliver more value to advertisers. One e-commerce retailer saw a 25% in conversion rate and a 14% improvement in return on ad-spend. There is a tremendous amount of transformation happening in our industry and on our platform. The adoption of UID2 by the infrastructure of the Internet is transforming the open Internet and where marketers put their very first dollar. In the coming quarters, we will talk more about all the amazing changes happening in identity, often driven by CTV. 2023 will likely have more market changes that create secular shifts in our direction with more data, more decisioning, better results and the best CTV experience consumers could ever have. One of the key factors in our progress with UID2 has been our success with the world\u2019s leading data aggregators such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce, Adobe and many, many others. Put simply, these companies house the first-party data of the world\u2019s leading advertisers. With UID2, advertisers can transact on that data without it ever leaving home. Because of this progress, I predict that more than half of the data inventory flowing through our platform by early next year, will be UID2 tag. With more and more of our publishers\u2019 inventory also UID tagged, that means the value of advertiser first-party data increases exponentially on our platform, more than 10x next year compared to this year. With this progress, the strategic value of UID2 in helping advertisers drive relevance in a privacy-centric manner becomes undeniable. While most of our advertisers are already transacting on UID2 on our platform in some way, I expect they will fully embrace it next year, because we have done the hard work on the data and the inventory side, advertisers now have every incentive to fully unleash the first-party data in a way that will supercharge their campaigns. They will finally be able to realize the value of their first-party data to model and understand where their next generation and most loyal customers are and reach those customers with precision, and of course, do that more effectively than ever. This gives me tremendous confidence for 2023 and beyond. I\u2019d like to close by just touching on our business here in Asia, as I have spent time with our teams here over the last few days. We are seeing great momentum across the region. We have recently posted some of the biggest months ever in offices such as Melbourne and New Delhi as we have benefited from new JBPs and MSAs across the region. We have built strategic partnerships with major inventory players in all of our key markets here. As I said during Investor Day, most publishers I speak with complain that they do not believe that they are getting their fair share of spend today relative to the walled gardens. That\u2019s true here in Asia, too. I met with one of the largest publishers here and they understand they need to maximize revenue on their digital content, but they need greater access to global advertiser demand. Many inventory partners in Asia are facing the same problem. As a result, they are looking to partner with The Trade Desk, a partner they can trust to be objective and transparent in delivering maximum advertiser value. On the demand side, Asia is witnessing the emergence of the largest middle class population in history. It is essential for brands to reach these consumers through the channels they use most. And in Asia, that means CTV or OTT or mobile, and of course, premium video on mobile. Because we made investments early across the Asia-Pacific region and in many key channels such as mobile, OTT and digital out-of-home, we are in a great position to build on those investments in the years ahead. To come back to where I started in Asia and around the world, the biggest brands in the world increasingly appreciate the value of data-driven advertising on our platform. We have established trust with advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver growth for their business in any macroeconomic environment. Many of them are now trusting us with significant multiyear partnerships. This means we have very high client retention rates. It means we can innovate with our clients to deliver premium value. Our focus on profitability funds that innovation and ensures that we will remain at the bleeding edge of our industry and that we never have to compromise our beliefs. As a result, we are one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. While I don\u2019t often comment on competitor performance, I do think it\u2019s worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors have contracted or grew in the single-digit range, we grew 31%. That shows that we are outperforming the market and that we are gaining share, even in what many are calling a challenging macro environment. While we will never be immune from those macro challenges, we are confident that we will continue to outperform. I could not be more confident and excited about how we are positioned for 2023 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we have discussed today and we will continue to innovate to lead the market and I am confident that the world\u2019s leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. First, it was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day last month in New York City. We always appreciate the opportunity to dive deeper into the drivers of our business and discuss our strategy in more detail. As our performance in Q3 shows we continue to execute extremely well in the current environment. We continue to grab share and significantly outpace our peers. We again delivered year-over-year revenue growth well into the double-digits, while many companies in the ad funded space have seen low single-digit or even negative year-over-year revenue growth. We have also managed our expenses efficiently, delivering strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Once again, our results reflect the continued shift from advertisers toward data-driven advertising and the open Internet as they continue to shift away from linear channels and walled gardens. Revenue in Q3 was $395 million, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty, which we are not immune to, our platform continues to deliver value for advertisers and we are building trust with our clients for the long-term. During the quarter, growth was broad-based across channels and verticals. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We are seeing progress in our shopper marketing business as our customers deploy retail data in more and more of their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results as advertisers utilize Solimar to sharpen campaign goals and activate our industry-leading AI. Q3 was another example of our ability to grow top line while scaling our cost structure efficiently, helping to drive meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, representing a margin of 41%. I\u2019m proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate strong EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that will prepare us for the tighter wave of opportunity ahead while still producing cash flow that helps fund our future growth. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow of nearly $500 million is up 53% from a year ago. While there will always be periods where we may lean into investment due to the opportunity, over the long-term, the best business models in the world generate long-term growth, profits and cash. I\u2019m fortunate to be part of a team that considers all of these in our investment decisions. From a channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q3, video, which includes CTV represented a low 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter as growth was again solid across both in app and mobile video. Display represented a low teens percent of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend, and international represented about 10% of spend in Q3. Spend growth in North America was resilient as we continue to win new business and gain share. CTV across Southeast Asia and Europe was very strong during the quarter, growing faster than in any other region. While still small compared to CTV spend in North America, we\u2019re encouraged to see CTV in both Europe and Southeast Asia rapidly increase year-over-year relative to their overall spend. Despite an uncertain macro environment, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on the long-term investments that will position us for strength when conditions improve. In an uncertain environment like today, advertisers become more deliberate with their ad spend, scrutinizing the effectiveness of their ad budgets much more carefully than they have done previously. As we have shown during similar environments in the past, as advertisers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, The Trade Desk wins more budget. Every ad run on our platform is measurable, and we are focused on driving the highest returns for every campaign as our clients are. As we\u2019re starting to hear more publicly from the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, they are beginning to prioritize programmatic decision advertising investments first because it delivers higher returns than they have seen in other channels. And on top of that, our company\u2019s unbiased partnership with them and that we don\u2019t own inventory, we don\u2019t compete with our customers, and we offer an unrivaled data marketplace where they can inspect, measure and enhance campaigns in ways that walled gardens either refuse to offer or merely cannot match, creates a durable advantage that we believe makes the future very bright for us and for our customers. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend travel more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink, automotive and technology were also very strong. Our automotive vertical is seeing a bit of a resurgence as a result of winning new business with large automotive manufacturers and the easing of supply chain issues the industry has seen over the better part of the last 2.5 years. Hobbies and interest in education were both below the average. Additionally, as expected, political was strong and represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3. We continue to believe there is still potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q3 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $245 million, up 32% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter were primarily driven by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing as we scale prudently to support long-term growth as well as return to office expenses. Income tax was $15 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income was $129 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $137 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $112 million. DSOs exit in the quarter were 92 days, up 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days, up 1 day from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $490 million, which would represent growth of 24% on a year-over-year basis. In Q4, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to about double compared with the prior quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $229 million in Q4. From a stock-based compensation perspective, we expect absolute stock-based compensation expense to decline year-over-year in Q4 due to the timing of the CEO performance award granted in Q4 of 2021. While uncertainty about the macro environment remains, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and gain share in the quarters and years ahead. Given the large and growing addressable market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to prudently invest in our business to innovate and to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive both profitable growth and achieve significant share gains with large growth drivers, including the secular shift to CTV, attracting more shopper marketing budgets, scaling our international operations to be ready when the macro environment improves, innovating the data marketplace, the U.S. midterm election cycle as well as elevated pressure on walled gardens, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Shyam Patil at SIG.\nShyam Patil: Hi, guys. Nice job on execution. I had a couple of questions. Jeff, can you expand and talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing with the macro? And then separately, just how you see the setup as we go into next year? And then just as a quick follow-up, Blake, could you just talk a little bit more about the 4Q guide and just some of your assumptions there? Thank you, guys.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the question. So let me first start with the macro and talk about this year. So I don\u2019t know that I have ever been more proud of our performance than what we just put up in Q3. And that\u2019s in large part because of the relative outperformance where most other stocks are either negative or reporting single-digit growth. We put up 31% and we\u2019re doing that in an environment that is a little bit more uncertain. If there was an advertising mix, it would be at an all-time high and it\u2019s hard to say whether that\u2019s because of macro headwinds or mostly macro uncertainty, but it would be high because of one of those themes in each case. But because we\u2019re definitely in an environment regardless of where that\u2019s coming from, where advertisers have to do more with less, it means more that we\u2019re winning share in this environment. And I definitely believe that we\u2019re grabbing land. So I take a lot of comfort in what Procter & Gamble said in their earnings report, which is that we are actively shifting our spend from linear and non-targeting TV into programmatic and digital that is a lot more precise. And so when you look at just the overall macro environment, I just think we\u2019re just doing so incredibly well on a relative basis, that it\u2019s hard not to be proud, it\u2019s hard not to look at what we\u2019ve done and see grabbing land. But when you turn our attention to 2023, and you start to look at all the new inventory that\u2019s going to come into CTV, whether that\u2019s from Disney+ or digital inventory from Peacock or HBO or Netflix or Paramount Plus or Fox or ESPN or Hulu or the fact that we reported in earnings that this year 11 markets outside the United States outperformed in the United States in premium video or connected television. And then you look at the UID tailwinds that we have, we just surpassed 600 partners in UID and that we\u2019re activating data at an unprecedented level. We are going to go from a minority of our \u2013 or I\u2019m sorry, of our data on our platform being enabled by UID to the majority of our third-party data being enabled by the beginning of next year. So we\u2019ll finish that work this year going from minority to majority. I do believe that in 2023, we will have the best data marketplace that the ecosystem has ever had. I think we will have the best first-party data onboarding that we\u2019ve ever had. And that\u2019s not even talking about OpenPath, which we didn\u2019t really have time to talk about in our prepared remarks, which will be direct integrations with hundreds of the world\u2019s largest content owners and that will accelerate our growth and land grabbing around the world irrespective of the macro environment in 2023. And of course, last but not least, with us partnering with over 80% of the largest retailers in the United States and of course, partnering with many all over the world, all of those trends point to an incredible opportunity for us in 2023, that wouldn\u2019t be possible without the grabbing of land that we\u2019re doing right now. So with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Blake to just talk a little bit more about the second part of your question.\nBlake Grayson: Hey, thanks, Shyam, for the question. So your question on Q4, just to start off on Q3, again, fundamentally great quarter, actually pretty steady, too, which was great to see 31% revenue growth off a relatively hard comp last year of 39%. And political has ramped up for us as well. So like you\u2019ve already seen standout performance versus peers who are growing at much smaller or negative rates, again, CTV led the way, still opportunity there. Shopper marketing is ramping up well for us, too. The Solimar adoption is exciting. We\u2019ve got the momentum on UID as well. And so just grabbing share from company zone, and you\u2019ve heard us talk about these JBPs as well. That\u2019s also been ramping and has been strong. And so as you think about, as when we think about going into Q4 in our setup, again, relative to the rest of the industry in Q4, we\u2019re growing significantly faster, which, in my mind, just confirms we\u2019re grabbing share. Advertisers are be more deliberate. I just personally believe we\u2019re in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID. As a Chief Financial Officer or CFO, I definitely appreciate the uncertainty that so many of my peers are facing right now, right? Like the best CFOs are actively working to rationalize the investments that they are making and they are prioritizing the ones that have proven measurable returns. And in that environment, The Trade Desk we gained share because companies are now prioritizing programmatic as the first place to invest that first dollar. So while you can obviously dial programmatic up and down quickly, it\u2019s doing really well for us. And to me, that just shows the power and the value of this model. Now specifically with regards to Q4 a couple of thoughts, not only is our Q4 sequential growth well into the double digits as many app funded companies are flat or negative. We\u2019re actually forecasting accelerating growth on a year-over-year basis in Q4. And I recognize that there\u2019s a political impact in there. But when I just step back a bit and look at a year-over-year acceleration in Q4 in this environment, to me, that\u2019s a standout performance for us and it gives us a lot of optimism about our future and the momentum that we\u2019ve got. And I hope that helps.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Youssef Squali at Truist Securities.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. I have two questions. First, maybe, Blake, can you talk about the \u2013 how you look at the expense structure for 2023, maybe talk about the puts and takes, growth versus the need to invest more? Do you expect margins to improve relative to where you are for \u2013 or will you end up in 2022? And Jeff, maybe going back to connected TV, very impressive kind of both numbers and color commentary. Can you maybe speak to the competitive positioning that you guys have relative to other CTV players? And do you believe that you are actually gaining share or losing share relative to other players that arguably are also benefiting from growth in CTV next year? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Blake, first I\u2019ll take the second and Tim, if you don\u2019t mind, adding color after I deal on CTV.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Hi, Youssef, thanks for the question. So with regards to thinking about expense structure in 2023 and such I really just like stepping back a bit to remind everyone that the business model in the situation we\u2019re in highly desirable, right? We\u2019ve got a situation where we\u2019re driving high top line growth. We\u2019ve got high adjusted EBITDA growth with strong margins. And we\u2019ve got not only strong free cash flow generation, but consistent free cash flow generation. So having all of those working together, which they are, it gives us an opportunity and ability to be deliberate with the choices that we make. I\u2019m just also super proud of our ability to stay disciplined with our investments regardless of the operating environment. I \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of companies out there that might have more resources than us that are pausing or even cutting their resources because they potentially invested too aggressively. And we didn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. I think maybe like some of these companies did, and that\u2019s paid off for us. We have the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and that includes hiring. As we think about 2023 specifically, should we see any significant changes in the situation, we definitely have levers available to make changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 during COVID, we can adapt. But still, the expense structure of the company today is better than it was pre-pandemic. But overall though, and I\u2019ve said this on a number of calls, we\u2019re always looking for ways to invest and drive growth that we think pays off for the long run. For 2023 specifically, I would say a couple of things. We do expect return-to-office expenses like travel and live events to return to pre COVID levels. And the other thing to keep in mind is I would expect seasonality of our expenses next year to be a bit more like 2016 to 2019 than they were in 2020, 2021. And just for example, we have our large company event that will finally move back to its regular timing in Q1, it was held in Q2 of this year. That\u2019s just a great opportunity to bring our team together, especially after what\u2019s gone on in the past few years, whether we\u2019re solidifying our culture, framing our strategy versus the opportunity we\u2019ve got. And also just highlighting, again, the discipline perspective we take as a company about driving profitable growth. So looking into 2023, I think we\u2019re in a great position to drive more scale and efficiency and free cash flow. And we have so many opportunity areas to focus on. I\u2019m really excited about that. And then...\nJeff Green: I\u2019ll start on CTV and then Tim if you want to speak to it as well. So I really think there\u2019s two parts to talk about on the CTV question. The first is just talk about the category a little bit and then also to just talk about why we win specifically inside the category. So of course, right now, at The Trade Desk, we\u2019re living a secular tailwind that I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever seen before, and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever see again and that is going to continue into 2023, largely because of the amount of inventory that is coming online. But also as you look across the open Internet, and whether that\u2019s inside of display or native or audio or any other channel because CTV is leading the way in forging the future of identity, CTV is not just leading in our business and not just the most interesting thing happening in programmatic, but it\u2019s the most interesting thing happening in ad-funded media. And so as a result, CTV is the first \u2013 is quickly becoming the place where people spend their very first dollar and was not surprised at all to see our partner, Disney+ report 12 million new subscribers. And of course, Netflix added a couple of million themselves on just the promise of an ad-funded option coming soon. So there\u2019s more inventory coming online, programmatic we\u2019ll just continue to drive CTV. And I do believe that very soon, CTV will be the most data-driven channel. And that to me is one of the things to really just focus on in terms of why we\u2019re winning inside of CTV. So why are we winning above everyone else. So in order to be competitive, you do have to be omni-channel. So you can\u2019t just be focused on CTV because you take the data and the learnings from all other channels and then apply those to CTV where CTV is a top of the funnel activity where you\u2019re typically creating awareness. And then all the other channels are follow-ups, if you will, to that really effective moving picture and sound that happens inside of CTV. And so in order to be most effective, you have to be holistic. So you have to be omnichannel, but you also have to be global and then very importantly, you have to be objective, which means you can\u2019t compete with any of the content owners, which is one of the themes that is really a problem for most of the walled gardens, especially Google, which is that, of course, they have their own media in YouTube. And so content creators are not eager to part with somebody \u2013 or to partner with somebody that they compete with in their very \u2013 in the core of their business. So by being objective and not competing with them by being global, by being omni-channel and then there\u2019s something that we say all the time to every content owner on the Internet, and that is that you have to have an authentication strategy and you have to have an identity strategy. And we\u2019re able to go to the content owners and partner with them on both of those things. And you see this with Disney. Disney is doing extremely well. We\u2019ve been very vocal. They have been very vocal about our partnership on UID. It is a part of their authentication and identity strategy. That is what makes personalized ads possible. That\u2019s what makes high CPM as possible. That\u2019s what makes low ad loads possible. So we become a really critical partner for them while not competing with them because we\u2019re objective. You put all that together, and that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re winning. But I\u2019m sure Tim, you can say more about this.\nTim Sims: Yes. Youssef, thanks for the question. And as I look out next year and kind of why I think we\u2019re differentiated and in a position to win, it\u2019s a little bit of what Jeff said. So you\u2019ve got a lot more inventory coming online. So as Jeff pointed out, we\u2019ve got Disney+ and Netflix, they get a lot of the word count in the ecosystem right now. But let\u2019s not forget, HBO Max, Paramount NBCU, Fox, the rest of Disney, Hulu, ESPN, ABC, etcetera are continuing to lean into programmatic. And the reason that they lean into us is if you think about it from their perspective, and they look back at the ecosystem of people who do what we do, a lot of those companies are competing with them. So they lean in heavily with us and they partner with us in a number of different ways, including on identity. So UID2, through our partnership with Disney, I think, is going to be a major catalyst for the CTV category. As a result, that inventory is going to have much richer decisioning going into next year across the entire category. So when I think about 2023, there\u2019s this like perfect collision of addressability and scale in the premium content space that we\u2019ve never seen before. And I think that\u2019s going to be a huge benefit to The Trade Desk because it\u2019s mostly to date in this CTV story. And I think in 2023, it\u2019s going to be a programmatic CTV story. And so I\u2019m really excited for that in 2023 because I think all of these things combining that addressability and that scale is going to create an environment for CTV to be the most data-driven channel in programmatic next year. And I am really excited for that. And as a result, I think CTV is going to very quickly become the first dollar spent in digital media, and I think The Trade Desk is well positioned going into next year.\nYoussef Squali: Super helpful.\nJeff Green: Thank you, Youssef. Next question, Holly.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Laura Martin with Needham.\nLaura Martin: Hey, Jeff, just following up on your comments about ID on connected television, the MAD data shows that 80% of viewing on connected television is shared does seem to undermine some of the targeting benefits that we had on individual devices like smartphones and tablets. That\u2019s my first question. And then my second is China. You\u2019re sitting in Singapore and you\u2019re noticeably silent on China. So could you give us an update on what\u2019s going on with China and your business these days? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Fantastic. Thanks, Laura. Really appreciate the question. So when it comes to shared viewing or the impact that, that has on CPMs or does it pose a threat to the ecosystem or is it a problem for CTV, let me just first sort of answer that emphatically, by saying it\u2019s not a problem for the ecosystem whether you frame it is CTV worth it. The answer is yes. Does it have a frequency capping problem, the answer is no. The bottom line is when we are considering, targeting or customizing ads, there is an individual graph, there is a household graph. Both of those are considered when we are making the placement of ads and shared viewing doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s worth any less. And in fact, what we are competing with is an environment in linear or broadcast television that is almost always shared viewing, but it\u2019s not measurable. So, finally, we have the ability to measure when it\u2019s being shared and when it\u2019s not. And of course, a lot of premium video is on personalized devices. And I have been reminded about it again and again this week as I am here in Asia and reminded how much premium video is consumed on mobile devices. So, household and individual graphs are both considered, but when you compare the sort of spray and pray a broadcast or traditional television, into the efficacy, the targeting, the identity-driven lower ad load with content that is more premium, you put all of that together, the impact on digital is exponentially more valuable than a linear broadcast and the efficacy has gone up way more than the cost. And as that phenomenon continues to unfold in 2023 that Tim was just describing really well, which is that it\u2019s becoming a programmatic story where there is more inventory, and we can select more and more from the sort of wider selection of ads, the personalization, the customization, the efficacy is only going to continue to go up. So, it\u2019s absolutely worth the shared viewing. I don\u2019t even view as an issue. I don\u2019t spend time thinking about it. So, as it relates to China, China is of course, one of the largest markets in the world, and we are constantly keeping our eye on the fact that while as a media market, it\u2019s about half the size of the United States. It is growing at twice the pace. As you recall, last year, China was our fastest-growing office in the world. This year, that hasn\u2019t been true, but that\u2019s largely just because of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical issues. So, we have been quiet, in large part because of those geopolitical issues and because there has been some slowdown. If the geopolitical issues weren\u2019t enough, there is also COVID lockdown that has affected them in a very significant way. But we have been quarter-over-quarter, up over 100% in this environment. Shanghai is no longer our smallest office, which it was just 18 months ago. And we just \u2013 we continue to believe that while the English-speaking world has led much of CTV, the Chinese-speaking world is the second most important as it relates to the premium video play and that we continue to look at China and all the Chinese-speaking nations of the world as a very important battleground for the future of global television and premium video, so still excited and bullish just a bunch of things that make a fair amount of uncertainty. Thanks, Laura. Appreciate the question.\nChris Toth: Next question Holly.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Justin Patterson at KeyBanc.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much. Two, if I can. Jeff, as you exit the year and have these data initiatives and OpenPath kicking in the year, how should we think about the competitive landscape and how that looks in 2023 versus what we have observed in the past? If I look at some recent commentary by Proctor & Gamble, it seems like there is a lot more programmatic budget and relationships up for grabs heading into next year. And then for Blake, I appreciate your color on the Q4 guide. Could you please put a finer point on some of the trends you observed quarter-to-date? And how we should think about growth over the rest of the quarter? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Yes. So, I think you are right in that. There is more and more budget that\u2019s going into programmatic. I think the commentary that we have heard from Procter & Gamble is indicative of that. As you have heard us say before, the supply chains of the open Internet, but really the supply chains of the entire ad-funded Internet have become a little bit murky and as often happens when markets mature, become just much more complicated. So, it becomes more and more important for us to be obsessing about supply chains or supply pads. I have said before that I think one way to characterize the success of Amazon, it is that they have had an executive team that has just obsessed about the supply chain and just making certain that they are getting things as efficiently as possible so that they can deliver to their consumers the best product as fast as possible for the best possible price. We have applied that same sort of obsession to the media supply chain, which in some ways is even more complicated. And we have said, as often as possible, we want to make certain that no one in the middle is taking more in fees or tax than they are adding in value. And we do believe that, that happens a fair amount of time because of complication and because of sort of draconian tactics of some of the biggest tech players in the world. Our way of combating that is to release products like OpenPath, where we plug in directly with the biggest publishers in the world. We have had a number of conversations with content creators, whether that\u2019s in CTV or in mobile apps or in traditional web development, where they have said they don\u2019t feel like anyone is representing them the way they would like to and they would like to do their own yield management and plug in with us directly. That creates a more efficient supply chain, while us maintaining our role on the buy side as well as our objectivity. So, when you couple that with all the data initiatives going into 2023, and I have said in the prepared remarks that I believe because of Unified ID data, especially first-party data will be 10x more valuable in 2023 than it\u2019s ever been historically. And that\u2019s largely just because of the math of UID and the scale of UID and not having to sync like we did in cookies, not only is the Internet getting an upgrade because we are going from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet, but we are also getting rid of some of the clunkiness that cookies had, which makes a data-driven Internet just so much more effective. And of course, it\u2019s better for consumers when it\u2019s opt-in. You put all that together, we have a more effective supply chain. While budgets are up for grabs, we think that we are more likely to get the first dollar than anyone else. And what has happened over the most of the history of The Trade Desk is that we got the leftovers from search and social and the walled gardens. And what\u2019s starting to happen now is we are getting the very first dollar, and that\u2019s happening more and more. We expect that to continue as a secular tailwind that CTV continues. So, I appreciate the question.\nBlake Grayson: And then, Justin, just on your question on the Q4 trend, one way maybe to think about it is, it\u2019s a little bit of a tale of two cities like and you have heard us say this before, like or a cave shape recovery, if you will, for certain verticals. Some areas like travel and auto are outperforming and they are making up for lost time. Some areas are more challenged. You have heard us talk about Europe, but as we have said that before. But specific to Europe, as we have said, we have seen incredible CTV growth there, which is amazing in light of the macro challenges. So, it makes me super optimistic for the future for us there. And then the automotive growth, especially it\u2019s been especially exciting to see some gains there. We have won new business and then some more existing from existing customers after a period of volatility over the past 2-or-so years. And so I think that \u2013 and then even if you talk about CPG companies, you got some that are doing incredibly well and then some that still have some supply chain challenges as well. So, I think that the breadth of the advertisers and the verticals that we represent bodes super well for us and like there is still areas of opportunity for us to gain share there, too.\nJustin Patterson: Thanks.\nChris Toth: Thanks Justin.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Tom White at D.A. Davidson.\nTom White: Great. Thanks. Given the elections here yesterday, I thought I would ask a question on political. Jeff, any big takeaways around political ad spend this cycle? Any learnings that we should kind of take away that you are taking away as to the future of political ad spend on CTV and I guess, just digital broadly? Thanks.\nJeff Green: You bet. So, one thing that\u2019s happened in the past is that we have seen them sort of focus on social and other parts of political. But what we have definitely seen this time is that CTV is the preferred channel for political advertisers, and it\u2019s playing a larger role in every election cycle. One thing that is just really important for me to note is that as there has been more and more mistrust of specific tech platforms in the political environment, we are really proud of the work that we have done to focus on providing a better democratic process for both sides of the aisle and making certain that our platform is objective and independent so that we can power both Democrats and Republicans and anybody else for that matter. And I think our team has done a phenomenal job over really the last decade in winning trust and providing reassurance to both sides that we are going to provide them with an objective platform that\u2019s going to make it possible for them to do the very best and sort of let the process do its thing. It\u2019s our job to run a better process not to advocate for specific candidates or to get in the middle politics more specifically. And as a result of creating that arm\u2019s length relationship, we once again believe we have run a better process and been a key contributor to running a healthy election. We expect that to grow in 2024 as we move into the next presidential cycle. But once again, CTV plays a very significant role, and we think it will play a bigger role in every election going forward. And we are really excited to see the election or election growth and expect that to continue into the future. So, I appreciate the question.\nTom White: Thanks.\nChris Toth: Thanks Tom.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald at Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Jeff, I want to know if you could talk about your decisioning intensity in CTV maybe versus other channels, particularly in the context of private marketplace deals and things of that ilk. Do you do as much heavy lifting there versus other channels? And do you get pushed back on pricing and any differences in the intensity there and also in CPMs?\nJeff Green: Yes. I appreciate the question, Brian. So, we have been asked some form of this question over time in various ways. And it\u2019s essentially to say do we add less value in CTV, or should we be charging less? So, it\u2019s \u2013 are just two different ways of asking that question. And I would argue that we add more value in CTV than we do in any other channel. And also the value that we are adding is going up over time. So, the first part of that is the reason why we are adding more value is because the stakes are higher. If you in the stock market, if you buy stocks at random or you buy them all in ETFs, they tend to go up over time. But if you buy ads at random, you will get your kicked every single time that you have to select very carefully. And in the world of CTV, when you are buying very highly expensive or high-cost impressions, the stakes are higher. You have to make certain that you use data to buy the right ones, you have to get reach and frequency right. And I would argue the only platform in the world that manages reach and frequency well on CTV is The Trade Desk. So, we add more value. And as time goes on, when you add more impressions, there is more opportunity to outperform and select more carefully. So, while there have been a series of PMPs or ways of buying and limited decisioning methodologies, those have gone down over time. And those are typically training wheels are on ramps for advertisers that over time are replaced with just high decisioning. And that\u2019s where all of our biggest advertisers are heading. That\u2019s where our product has done. And we think over time that we just continue to add more value for essentially the same cost as we do in everything else, but our take rate having remained the same, pretty much our entire existence as a publicly traded company. So, I think it\u2019s something that has been important for us to clarify. And so I really appreciate the question, Brian.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks Jeff.\nChris Toth: Next question.\nOperator: Your next question for today is coming from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks. Jeff, just a UID follow-up, we have heard concerns that publishers are being slow to adopt UID. What can you do to speed up adoption? And how are you thinking about this? Do you agree? Do you disagree? Thanks.\nJeff Green: You bet. So, I am constantly reminded that if you sat me down a year ago and said Jeff, write up a dream list of adopters. I don\u2019t think I could have fictionalized or made up a list that\u2019s more impressive than those that we have actually added AWS, Salesforce, Snowflake, Adobe, you heard us saying a year ago that we needed to add the infrastructure of the Internet. And those and hundreds of others represent that infrastructure with now approaching 600 partners. And that doesn\u2019t even underscore the entire infrastructure of the data ecosystem of the Internet, names like Experian or InfoSum or so many others. So, with all of those coming online and then you add the CTV players companies like Disney, who have adopted it, and it will be just really critical next year that all CTV players are leveraging UID in order to get the personalization and the high CPMs that they all desperately need to compete. When you put all that together, I actually don\u2019t have any idea where that assertion is coming from that publishers are going slow. The only way that I could possibly make sense of that, just that some of them, it takes a little bit of time to prioritize and actually implement. But in terms of commitment or signing or prioritizing, it\u2019s there across the board. And we have so much momentum on the issue that I honestly, a year ago wouldn\u2019t have thought it\u2019s possible for us to have the momentum that we have now. And I believe it\u2019s just critical for companies, especially content owners to be leveraging that in order to do well. And you will see us in 2023 push really hard to enable advertisers to bring their first-party data to bear. And I do think that, that will represent a very strong rebuttal to the value propositions of walled gardens and the leverage of first-party data and their ecosystems. Because here, they will get to put their first-party data to work and then measure relative performance, learn from it, take the learnings with them so that they can continue to improve their marketing and not just outsource advertising and marketing to walled gardens, which has historically been the only option that they have had. So, UID plays a really critical role in the future of the open Internet, and it\u2019s doing its job.\nChris Toth: Thanks Jason. Let\u2019s take one more question Holly.\nOperator: Your final question for today is coming from Michael Morris at Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning guys. I have two topics I would like to ask about. One about the joint business plan momentum and one about Asia. So, on the first topic of the JBPs, I would love to hear how \u2013 if there is some way you could quantify or help us understand how much more valuable a partnership through a JBP is compared to sort of your run rate business or somebody, a partner who is not involved in one of those, how much value does it add? And also how penetrated is the market at this point for those? How much more runway do you feel you have with respect to the kind of addressable market for partners that are of this size that it makes sense for. So, that\u2019s the first topic. And then the second just on Asia. Jeff, you did spend a lot of time talking about the opportunity there. The Asia-Pac market historically has been a pretty tough market for Western companies as they compete with local players. So, I would love to hear a little bit about why you think you can be successful where maybe some companies in the past have not? Thank you.\nJeff Green: You bet. Thank you. I am going to have Tim take the first part of the question on the JBPs, then I will add some color and talk about Asia.\nTim Sims: Yes. Michael, thanks for the question on the JBPs. I will kind of try to cover everything that you mentioned there. So, first, starting with what\u2019s the difference between a JBP and a typical engagement. One of the major differences in the JBP is that these tend to be multiyear agreements between The Trade Desk and a brand or agency. And they tend to set kind of a partnership framework that often includes milestones for that partnership over that multiyear agreement, which is typically a longer period of time than a standard MSA that we would sign with a client. So, within that framework, typically the way that these work is that the advertiser, we sit down and we set goals for ourselves around things like how do we move more spend into the platform, how do we think about adjusting their investment mix moving it towards more data-driven advertising, how do we think about using platform features that they may be underutilizing. It\u2019s a really great framework to structure how we build a stronger partnership with that brand or agency over a longer period of time. And one of the incredible benefits of that is it creates a lot of stickiness and engagement with our partners over that period of time because we are constantly checking in on achievement against those milestones. And I think the way that we look at those as just these longer term engagements is it really creates a lot of a deeper conversation with our partners so that we can really figure out how we are structuring these that are going to see the best interest of their business and how we can kind of jointly agree on what we are going to try to achieve together over a multiyear period. So, in the end, all that leads to a much more interesting and dynamic conversation and discussion over time. And we are really excited about the momentum that we have right now, and we are expecting to continue to build on that into the future with more JBPs with more clients.\nJeff Green: Thanks Tim. Well, said, I don\u2019t have anything to add on the JBPs. I am excited to weigh in on Asia, though, because I really appreciate your question. And of course, we are also all sitting here in Singapore and nearing our 10-year anniversary of being here in the Asia market where we started here in Singapore. So, we have a team in our company that we are not an American company, we are a global company that happens to be based in the United States. And can we be successful in Asia, my response is we already are. 11 markets in CTV or premium video grew faster than the United States for us. So, when I say 11 markets, I am not \u2013 I am not talking about it in general. I am talking about The Trade Desk markets. Our spend grew faster in 11 markets for premium video outside the United States than it did inside the United States, the fastest region for growth around the world, Southeast Asia. It grew faster than Australia grew faster than North Asia, grew faster than Europe. It grew faster or South America. And that\u2019s in large part because we are \u2013 just like in every other market, creating alternatives, especially UGC, where YouTube has a very dominant position in many of the markets here. But also you are seeing from the content creators that historically, they have had sort of a regional benefit where there is licensing that has prevented U.S. companies from competing with them in their markets. But one of the reasons why you have seen Australia a close rival to leading in terms of size or percentage of market moving to CTV with the U.S., those two leading the way is because with English language content that no longer having regional barriers, but English content is competing all over the world. And the same thing is happening with Chinese content and all others. So, what you are seeing is that the content owners are no longer viewing their next door neighbor in sort of broadcast as their biggest competitors, but instead looking at companies like Disney and Netflix is their biggest competitors around the world. So, they are all looking at the ad-funded options that those companies are creating around the world and saying that we quickly have to follow in order to compete. And so as a result, we are getting partnerships all over the world. We are setting up partnerships. That is the reason our executive team is here in Asia is because it\u2019s not lost on us, but most of the GDP growth for the next 10 years is going to come out of Asia. And that in order for us to capture our fair share of that $1 trillion TAM, we have to be competitive in Asia as well as in other regions of the world. We are already doing that. And we have been doing that in this market despite things like the strong dollar and economic headwinds and some geopolitical issues, but we continue to do that because of strong partnership and a global mindset. And of course, we represent most of the largest brand in the world. And whether you are talking about Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola or McDonald\u2019s, these brands advertise all over the world, and it\u2019s not lost on them that GDP growth is going to come out of Asia. It\u2019s not lost on them that the fastest-growing middle class in the world is here in Asia. So, you put all of that together, it\u2019s a market that we are already winning in and we will continue to do so. We have over invested. If you look at our employee count versus our revenue, of course, we are early, not late. And that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing. Thank you.\nChris Toth: Thanks Michael. And Holly, you can close up the call.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us. As Chris mentioned, I am thrilled to be speaking with you today from our Singapore office, our South Asia headquarters. This is the first time that I have been in Asia since January of 2020 due to the global pandemic. And it's been great to reconnect with our team, our clients and our partners here in-person this week. Asia as a whole is crucial to our long-term growth and it's always inspiring to spend time here, more on that later, but first, on to our results. As you have seen in the release, The Trade Desk posted another very strong quarter with revenue growth up 31% year-over-year. We continue to gain share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Throughout 2022 and in particular, in Q3, The Trade Desk has significantly outperformed seemingly all other forms of digital with a significant contrast to walled gardens in our ability to win advertising budgets. It is very clear that under the current operating conditions, we are significantly outpacing the market regardless of the macro environment. Our vision and business strategy continues to be validated by our advertising clients. Nearly every single major advertiser wants a world where the open Internet thrives, where competition and price discovery thrive. They want great measurement that works across the web so that they can compare the performance of each site, app or destination to all the others. They want an Internet where relative value can be found as we have predicted CTV is a catalyst for massive change on the Internet, when possible, the power balance is shifting to the open Internet away from opaque walled gardens and systems that aren't comparable to others. In short, more and more, our clients embrace the value of the open internet compared to the limitations of walled gardens and they are embracing The Trade Desk as the default platform to execute on the open Internet. This is resulting in closer relationships with the largest brands and agencies in the world. Our client relationships are stronger than ever, because they are based on shared values and goals, a strong buy-side roadmap and Internet where relative value and objective measurement can thrive with data-driven empowerment for brands and advertisers rather than a tech company who is just asking the brand or agency to outsource media buying to them and send their first-party data down a one-way street. Because of this contrast, we are signing joint business plans with brands at a record pace. Some of the largest JBPs signed this year represent spend of over $1 billion in the future. In this way, not only do these JBPs position the Trade Desk for future growth, but they also create an environment for joint programmatic innovation. JBPs represent strong alignment with brands that only come as a result of not owning media, whether it's decision CTV, new approaches to identity, unleashing first-party data, advanced data and retail marketplaces, our clients are working with us to pioneer the future of digital advertising. With this context, hopefully, you can see why we continue to outperform the industry and gain share and why we are confident that our future growth outpaces the projections of almost everyone else in our industry. Just one more data point on the market overall and how we are performing. WPP's GroupM predictive worldwide advertising will increase 8.4% in 2022 and we are growing at more than 3x that rate. CTV continues to be a key growth driver and our shopper marketing initiatives are yielding very encouraging results. While still early, it's only our third full quarter total shopper marketing spend increased nearly 3x from Q2 to Q3. As we said at Investor Day, we believe that more than 80% of the largest retailers in the United States partner with The Trade Desk and more of the world's leading retailers are also now following suit. The chorus of retailers making retail measurement available is furthering the power and benefits of an open competitive Internet, while CTV maybe the biggest force of change for the open Internet, perhaps retail media and its accompanying data is a close second. Political also continues to perform well. Mid-term election \u2013 over mid-term election, we have exponentially grown our business. We are proud of the work we do in political advertising, particularly our focus on helping provide a better advertising process for all political candidates. We are an objective and independent platform open to registered candidates on both sides. With all of this in mind, I believe that through the first 9 months of the year, we have gained more market share, grabbed more land than at any point in our history. To provide more color on why, I'd like to touch on three areas. First is the growing importance of programmatic on the open Internet even in a volatile macro environment; second is the transformational role of CTV and showcasing that value; and last is the critical mass of support that is growing around Unified ID 2.0. And why this is so important in building the new identity fabric of the Internet. So first, in terms of the macro environment, increasingly, advertisers view programmatic as one of the most effective ways to drive relevance and differentiation, especially in times of market volatility. And perhaps even more importantly, they believe that the open Internet is the best place to create that value compared to the limitations of the walled gardens. You only have to look at a couple of comments made by the CFO of P&G during the most recent earnings call a couple of weeks ago. As you may know, Procter & Gamble is one of the world's largest and most progressive advertisers. He said, and I quote, \u201cit is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear non-targeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend. That is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it. We now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the U.S. or in Europe, but around the world and that is allowing us to drive significant productivity while increasing reach while increasing quality of reach and while more precisely targeting our consumers.\u201d Back in early 2020, as we entered that short-lived COVID dip, I talked about how easy it was for large brands to turn off programmatic with the first hint of uncertainty. But what you are hearing from P&G there and what I hear from major brands around the world everyday now is that programmatic is a central and critical component of any campaign. The world's most sophisticated advertisers understand that as they get more pressure from their CFOs to demonstrate the value and return of every advertising dollar, one of the best places to do that is on our platform. We provide objective transparent measurement. We provide precision and relevance. We allow advertisers to optimize based on real-time performance and we provide access to the world's most advanced data marketplace including many of the world's biggest retailers. CMOs and CFOs are carefully watching costs and spend at this moment. It is why we are particularly excited by the growth on our platform this quarter. This moment is also a time when advertisers have clear goals and our objective partnership is really important to them achieving those goals. We recently ran a campaign for Clarence, one of the world's largest multinational cosmetic companies. They wanted to reach career women with a specific new product in the UK. They wanted to do it cost effectively with minimal waste with optimal precision. Using our platform, they were able to launch a multi-channel campaign, including mobile, CTV, digital out-of-home and audio. They were able to pivot based on channel performance and retarget based on engagement. As a result, they were able to drive significant new traffic to their website, 8% of whom purchased the product, driving an exponential sales increase, all as part of a highly decisioned campaign that was automatically optimized on the fly to maximize performance and minimize waste. In an environment with ROI scrutiny of every advertising dollar this is exactly the kind of campaign optimization that CMOs are looking for. And as a result, they are increasingly gravitating to our platform. Nowhere is this more apparent than CTV, the second area I want to cover. Once again, CTV was our fastest growing channel and it has rapidly become our largest. For years now, we have been talking about how the English-speaking markets have been leading the adoption of CTV advertising. The U.S. and Australia have been great leaders and case studies for the world, both benefiting from the fragmented and competitive nature of content in their markets, but now CTV adoption is going global. Perhaps the most bullish statement I will make this year is that our CTV spend grew in the majority of our international markets faster than it did in the United States. I have said previously that the U.S. and Australia are leading the way on CTV and that markets like the UK and France are following fast, but that pace is picking up in all corners of the world, especially as advertisers look for more relevance and precision in their biggest campaign category. Let me give you a couple of quick examples. When Mercedes launched a new C-class model in Australia this year, they wanted to lift brand awareness among the key demographics. Working with us, they were able to deploy a CTV strategy that reached 1.5 million households with precision and which ultimately increased brand awareness 11% among their key targets. ViewSonic is a multinational electronics company headquartered in Taiwan. They wanted to launch a new monitor aimed at gamers in key markets such as India, the Philippines, Germany and UK. Working with us, they launched a CTV campaign, which was constantly optimized via Koa on our platform letting them iterate based on campaign performance and engagement. They saw significant improvements in all aspects of the campaign performance from reach to cost effectiveness compared to industry benchmarks. They were also able to link thousands of new engagements on their product website directly to the campaign. Back in the U.S., Lexus wanted to reach a new generation of millennial buyers for their luxury cars most of whom have abandoned linear TV and moved in mass to streaming platforms. They were able to target key audiences with little to no waste and effective frequency management. They were able to reach 15 million potential new customers driving 5x more website traffic than the previous year, with an astonishing 67% improvement in purchase intent among key targets. Our success in CTV is multifaceted. On our platform, we have built the optimization tools that enable advertisers to drive these kind of results with precision as part of an omnichannel strategy. But on the inventory side, we have developed very close working partnerships with pretty much every premium CTV provider worldwide. While much has been said about Netflix moving to advertising and we are excited about what that opportunity means for our industry and our business, there are many leading content providers that are driving innovation in CTV. Not enough has been said in recent months about what is happening from the content creators who have long histories in advertising and what they are doing to continue to innovate. Disney will launch advertising on the Disney+ platform in December and they are incredibly progressive in how they are enabling advertisers to leverage their own first-party data via UID2. We are very proud to be their partner. Transaction volume will grow over time and their standards on ad load and the use of UID2 will put pressure on the rest of the industry to think about CTV in a way that maximizes advertiser value and optimizes the consumers' experience. Peacock is one of our longest standing CTV partners. As with many broadcasters who begin the CTV journey, much of our work with them was initially in a fixed price context, testing the market. But I am thrilled to report today the vast majority of Peacock inventory that flows through our system is fully decisioned and biddable. And as a result, CPMs have increased significantly, while advertisers are spending more and of course, seeing more value. CTV providers that understand the benefits and gains of fully biddable and decisioned inventory will win over time. They will maximize revenue by helping advertisers drive precision and relevance. UID2 is rapidly emerging as a key new CTV identity currency as I predicted it would. Let's remember that cookies are not present in CTV. There is nothing about the role of UID2 in CTV that is a response to the deprecation of cookies. Rather, it is recognition among CTV leaders that they need a way to provide advertisers with relevance in a way that protects consumer privacy as part of omnichannel campaigns. One of the first CTV platforms to embrace UID2 was Fubo and the results they have seen have been incredibly impressive. Fubo itself has seen ad revenues on our platform increase 113% faster than impression growth. Advertising spend on Fubo on our platform has increased more than 60% and CPMs are up significantly. And with UID2, they are also able to deliver more value to advertisers. One e-commerce retailer saw a 25% in conversion rate and a 14% improvement in return on ad-spend. There is a tremendous amount of transformation happening in our industry and on our platform. The adoption of UID2 by the infrastructure of the Internet is transforming the open Internet and where marketers put their very first dollar. In the coming quarters, we will talk more about all the amazing changes happening in identity, often driven by CTV. 2023 will likely have more market changes that create secular shifts in our direction with more data, more decisioning, better results and the best CTV experience consumers could ever have. One of the key factors in our progress with UID2 has been our success with the world's leading data aggregators such as AWS, Snowflake, Salesforce, Adobe and many, many others. Put simply, these companies house the first-party data of the world's leading advertisers. With UID2, advertisers can transact on that data without it ever leaving home. Because of this progress, I predict that more than half of the data inventory flowing through our platform by early next year, will be UID2 tag. With more and more of our publishers' inventory also UID tagged, that means the value of advertiser first-party data increases exponentially on our platform, more than 10x next year compared to this year. With this progress, the strategic value of UID2 in helping advertisers drive relevance in a privacy-centric manner becomes undeniable. While most of our advertisers are already transacting on UID2 on our platform in some way, I expect they will fully embrace it next year, because we have done the hard work on the data and the inventory side, advertisers now have every incentive to fully unleash the first-party data in a way that will supercharge their campaigns. They will finally be able to realize the value of their first-party data to model and understand where their next generation and most loyal customers are and reach those customers with precision, and of course, do that more effectively than ever. This gives me tremendous confidence for 2023 and beyond. I'd like to close by just touching on our business here in Asia, as I have spent time with our teams here over the last few days. We are seeing great momentum across the region. We have recently posted some of the biggest months ever in offices such as Melbourne and New Delhi as we have benefited from new JBPs and MSAs across the region. We have built strategic partnerships with major inventory players in all of our key markets here. As I said during Investor Day, most publishers I speak with complain that they do not believe that they are getting their fair share of spend today relative to the walled gardens. That's true here in Asia, too. I met with one of the largest publishers here and they understand they need to maximize revenue on their digital content, but they need greater access to global advertiser demand. Many inventory partners in Asia are facing the same problem. As a result, they are looking to partner with The Trade Desk, a partner they can trust to be objective and transparent in delivering maximum advertiser value. On the demand side, Asia is witnessing the emergence of the largest middle class population in history. It is essential for brands to reach these consumers through the channels they use most. And in Asia, that means CTV or OTT or mobile, and of course, premium video on mobile. Because we made investments early across the Asia-Pacific region and in many key channels such as mobile, OTT and digital out-of-home, we are in a great position to build on those investments in the years ahead. To come back to where I started in Asia and around the world, the biggest brands in the world increasingly appreciate the value of data-driven advertising on our platform. We have established trust with advertisers and their agencies that we can deliver growth for their business in any macroeconomic environment. Many of them are now trusting us with significant multiyear partnerships. This means we have very high client retention rates. It means we can innovate with our clients to deliver premium value. Our focus on profitability funds that innovation and ensures that we will remain at the bleeding edge of our industry and that we never have to compromise our beliefs. As a result, we are one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. While I don't often comment on competitor performance, I do think it's worth noting again that in an environment where many of our competitors have contracted or grew in the single-digit range, we grew 31%. That shows that we are outperforming the market and that we are gaining share, even in what many are calling a challenging macro environment. While we will never be immune from those macro challenges, we are confident that we will continue to outperform. I could not be more confident and excited about how we are positioned for 2023 and beyond. Our business has many growth drivers, as we have discussed today and we will continue to innovate to lead the market and I am confident that the world's leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will give you more color on the quarter. Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the question. So let me first start with the macro and talk about this year. So I don't know that I have ever been more proud of our performance than what we just put up in Q3. And that's in large part because of the relative outperformance where most other stocks are either negative or reporting single-digit growth. We put up 31% and we're doing that in an environment that is a little bit more uncertain. If there was an advertising mix, it would be at an all-time high and it's hard to say whether that's because of macro headwinds or mostly macro uncertainty, but it would be high because of one of those themes in each case. But because we're definitely in an environment regardless of where that's coming from, where advertisers have to do more with less, it means more that we're winning share in this environment. And I definitely believe that we're grabbing land. So I take a lot of comfort in what Procter & Gamble said in their earnings report, which is that we are actively shifting our spend from linear and non-targeting TV into programmatic and digital that is a lot more precise. And so when you look at just the overall macro environment, I just think we're just doing so incredibly well on a relative basis, that it's hard not to be proud, it's hard not to look at what we've done and see grabbing land. But when you turn our attention to 2023, and you start to look at all the new inventory that's going to come into CTV, whether that's from Disney+ or digital inventory from Peacock or HBO or Netflix or Paramount Plus or Fox or ESPN or Hulu or the fact that we reported in earnings that this year 11 markets outside the United States outperformed in the United States in premium video or connected television. And then you look at the UID tailwinds that we have, we just surpassed 600 partners in UID and that we're activating data at an unprecedented level. We are going to go from a minority of our \u2013 or I'm sorry, of our data on our platform being enabled by UID to the majority of our third-party data being enabled by the beginning of next year. So we'll finish that work this year going from minority to majority. I do believe that in 2023, we will have the best data marketplace that the ecosystem has ever had. I think we will have the best first-party data onboarding that we've ever had. And that's not even talking about OpenPath, which we didn't really have time to talk about in our prepared remarks, which will be direct integrations with hundreds of the world's largest content owners and that will accelerate our growth and land grabbing around the world irrespective of the macro environment in 2023. And of course, last but not least, with us partnering with over 80% of the largest retailers in the United States and of course, partnering with many all over the world, all of those trends point to an incredible opportunity for us in 2023, that wouldn't be possible without the grabbing of land that we're doing right now. So with that, I'll pass it over to Blake to just talk a little bit more about the second part of your question. Thanks, Shyam. Next question, Holly. Blake, first I'll take the second and Tim, if you don't mind, adding color after I deal on CTV. I'll start on CTV and then Tim if you want to speak to it as well. So I really think there's two parts to talk about on the CTV question. The first is just talk about the category a little bit and then also to just talk about why we win specifically inside the category. So of course, right now, at The Trade Desk, we're living a secular tailwind that I don't know that we've ever seen before, and I don't know that we'll ever see again and that is going to continue into 2023, largely because of the amount of inventory that is coming online. But also as you look across the open Internet, and whether that's inside of display or native or audio or any other channel because CTV is leading the way in forging the future of identity, CTV is not just leading in our business and not just the most interesting thing happening in programmatic, but it's the most interesting thing happening in ad-funded media. And so as a result, CTV is the first \u2013 is quickly becoming the place where people spend their very first dollar and was not surprised at all to see our partner, Disney+ report 12 million new subscribers. And of course, Netflix added a couple of million themselves on just the promise of an ad-funded option coming soon. So there's more inventory coming online, programmatic we'll just continue to drive CTV. And I do believe that very soon, CTV will be the most data-driven channel. And that to me is one of the things to really just focus on in terms of why we're winning inside of CTV. So why are we winning above everyone else. So in order to be competitive, you do have to be omni-channel. So you can't just be focused on CTV because you take the data and the learnings from all other channels and then apply those to CTV where CTV is a top of the funnel activity where you're typically creating awareness. And then all the other channels are follow-ups, if you will, to that really effective moving picture and sound that happens inside of CTV. And so in order to be most effective, you have to be holistic. So you have to be omnichannel, but you also have to be global and then very importantly, you have to be objective, which means you can't compete with any of the content owners, which is one of the themes that is really a problem for most of the walled gardens, especially Google, which is that, of course, they have their own media in YouTube. And so content creators are not eager to part with somebody \u2013 or to partner with somebody that they compete with in their very \u2013 in the core of their business. So by being objective and not competing with them by being global, by being omni-channel and then there's something that we say all the time to every content owner on the Internet, and that is that you have to have an authentication strategy and you have to have an identity strategy. And we're able to go to the content owners and partner with them on both of those things. And you see this with Disney. Disney is doing extremely well. We've been very vocal. They have been very vocal about our partnership on UID. It is a part of their authentication and identity strategy. That is what makes personalized ads possible. That's what makes high CPM as possible. That's what makes low ad loads possible. So we become a really critical partner for them while not competing with them because we're objective. You put all that together, and that's the reason we're winning. But I'm sure Tim, you can say more about this. Thank you, Youssef. Next question, Holly. Fantastic. Thanks, Laura. Really appreciate the question. So when it comes to shared viewing or the impact that, that has on CPMs or does it pose a threat to the ecosystem or is it a problem for CTV, let me just first sort of answer that emphatically, by saying it's not a problem for the ecosystem whether you frame it is CTV worth it. The answer is yes. Does it have a frequency capping problem, the answer is no. The bottom line is when we are considering, targeting or customizing ads, there is an individual graph, there is a household graph. Both of those are considered when we are making the placement of ads and shared viewing doesn't necessarily mean that it's worth any less. And in fact, what we are competing with is an environment in linear or broadcast television that is almost always shared viewing, but it's not measurable. So, finally, we have the ability to measure when it's being shared and when it's not. And of course, a lot of premium video is on personalized devices. And I have been reminded about it again and again this week as I am here in Asia and reminded how much premium video is consumed on mobile devices. So, household and individual graphs are both considered, but when you compare the sort of spray and pray a broadcast or traditional television, into the efficacy, the targeting, the identity-driven lower ad load with content that is more premium, you put all of that together, the impact on digital is exponentially more valuable than a linear broadcast and the efficacy has gone up way more than the cost. And as that phenomenon continues to unfold in 2023 that Tim was just describing really well, which is that it's becoming a programmatic story where there is more inventory, and we can select more and more from the sort of wider selection of ads, the personalization, the customization, the efficacy is only going to continue to go up. So, it's absolutely worth the shared viewing. I don't even view as an issue. I don't spend time thinking about it. So, as it relates to China, China is of course, one of the largest markets in the world, and we are constantly keeping our eye on the fact that while as a media market, it's about half the size of the United States. It is growing at twice the pace. As you recall, last year, China was our fastest-growing office in the world. This year, that hasn't been true, but that's largely just because of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical issues. So, we have been quiet, in large part because of those geopolitical issues and because there has been some slowdown. If the geopolitical issues weren't enough, there is also COVID lockdown that has affected them in a very significant way. But we have been quarter-over-quarter, up over 100% in this environment. Shanghai is no longer our smallest office, which it was just 18 months ago. And we just \u2013 we continue to believe that while the English-speaking world has led much of CTV, the Chinese-speaking world is the second most important as it relates to the premium video play and that we continue to look at China and all the Chinese-speaking nations of the world as a very important battleground for the future of global television and premium video, so still excited and bullish just a bunch of things that make a fair amount of uncertainty. Thanks, Laura. Appreciate the question. Yes. So, I think you are right in that. There is more and more budget that's going into programmatic. I think the commentary that we have heard from Procter & Gamble is indicative of that. As you have heard us say before, the supply chains of the open Internet, but really the supply chains of the entire ad-funded Internet have become a little bit murky and as often happens when markets mature, become just much more complicated. So, it becomes more and more important for us to be obsessing about supply chains or supply pads. I have said before that I think one way to characterize the success of Amazon, it is that they have had an executive team that has just obsessed about the supply chain and just making certain that they are getting things as efficiently as possible so that they can deliver to their consumers the best product as fast as possible for the best possible price. We have applied that same sort of obsession to the media supply chain, which in some ways is even more complicated. And we have said, as often as possible, we want to make certain that no one in the middle is taking more in fees or tax than they are adding in value. And we do believe that, that happens a fair amount of time because of complication and because of sort of draconian tactics of some of the biggest tech players in the world. Our way of combating that is to release products like OpenPath, where we plug in directly with the biggest publishers in the world. We have had a number of conversations with content creators, whether that's in CTV or in mobile apps or in traditional web development, where they have said they don't feel like anyone is representing them the way they would like to and they would like to do their own yield management and plug in with us directly. That creates a more efficient supply chain, while us maintaining our role on the buy side as well as our objectivity. So, when you couple that with all the data initiatives going into 2023, and I have said in the prepared remarks that I believe because of Unified ID data, especially first-party data will be 10x more valuable in 2023 than it's ever been historically. And that's largely just because of the math of UID and the scale of UID and not having to sync like we did in cookies, not only is the Internet getting an upgrade because we are going from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet, but we are also getting rid of some of the clunkiness that cookies had, which makes a data-driven Internet just so much more effective. And of course, it's better for consumers when it's opt-in. You put all that together, we have a more effective supply chain. While budgets are up for grabs, we think that we are more likely to get the first dollar than anyone else. And what has happened over the most of the history of The Trade Desk is that we got the leftovers from search and social and the walled gardens. And what's starting to happen now is we are getting the very first dollar, and that's happening more and more. We expect that to continue as a secular tailwind that CTV continues. So, I appreciate the question. You bet. So, one thing that's happened in the past is that we have seen them sort of focus on social and other parts of political. But what we have definitely seen this time is that CTV is the preferred channel for political advertisers, and it's playing a larger role in every election cycle. One thing that is just really important for me to note is that as there has been more and more mistrust of specific tech platforms in the political environment, we are really proud of the work that we have done to focus on providing a better democratic process for both sides of the aisle and making certain that our platform is objective and independent so that we can power both Democrats and Republicans and anybody else for that matter. And I think our team has done a phenomenal job over really the last decade in winning trust and providing reassurance to both sides that we are going to provide them with an objective platform that's going to make it possible for them to do the very best and sort of let the process do its thing. It's our job to run a better process not to advocate for specific candidates or to get in the middle politics more specifically. And as a result of creating that arm's length relationship, we once again believe we have run a better process and been a key contributor to running a healthy election. We expect that to grow in 2024 as we move into the next presidential cycle. But once again, CTV plays a very significant role, and we think it will play a bigger role in every election going forward. And we are really excited to see the election or election growth and expect that to continue into the future. So, I appreciate the question. Yes. I appreciate the question, Brian. So, we have been asked some form of this question over time in various ways. And it's essentially to say do we add less value in CTV, or should we be charging less? So, it's \u2013 are just two different ways of asking that question. And I would argue that we add more value in CTV than we do in any other channel. And also the value that we are adding is going up over time. So, the first part of that is the reason why we are adding more value is because the stakes are higher. If you in the stock market, if you buy stocks at random or you buy them all in ETFs, they tend to go up over time. But if you buy ads at random, you will get your kicked every single time that you have to select very carefully. And in the world of CTV, when you are buying very highly expensive or high-cost impressions, the stakes are higher. You have to make certain that you use data to buy the right ones, you have to get reach and frequency right. And I would argue the only platform in the world that manages reach and frequency well on CTV is The Trade Desk. So, we add more value. And as time goes on, when you add more impressions, there is more opportunity to outperform and select more carefully. So, while there have been a series of PMPs or ways of buying and limited decisioning methodologies, those have gone down over time. And those are typically training wheels are on ramps for advertisers that over time are replaced with just high decisioning. And that's where all of our biggest advertisers are heading. That's where our product has done. And we think over time that we just continue to add more value for essentially the same cost as we do in everything else, but our take rate having remained the same, pretty much our entire existence as a publicly traded company. So, I think it's something that has been important for us to clarify. And so I really appreciate the question, Brian. You bet. So, I am constantly reminded that if you sat me down a year ago and said Jeff, write up a dream list of adopters. I don't think I could have fictionalized or made up a list that's more impressive than those that we have actually added AWS, Salesforce, Snowflake, Adobe, you heard us saying a year ago that we needed to add the infrastructure of the Internet. And those and hundreds of others represent that infrastructure with now approaching 600 partners. And that doesn't even underscore the entire infrastructure of the data ecosystem of the Internet, names like Experian or InfoSum or so many others. So, with all of those coming online and then you add the CTV players companies like Disney, who have adopted it, and it will be just really critical next year that all CTV players are leveraging UID in order to get the personalization and the high CPMs that they all desperately need to compete. When you put all that together, I actually don't have any idea where that assertion is coming from that publishers are going slow. The only way that I could possibly make sense of that, just that some of them, it takes a little bit of time to prioritize and actually implement. But in terms of commitment or signing or prioritizing, it's there across the board. And we have so much momentum on the issue that I honestly, a year ago wouldn't have thought it's possible for us to have the momentum that we have now. And I believe it's just critical for companies, especially content owners to be leveraging that in order to do well. And you will see us in 2023 push really hard to enable advertisers to bring their first-party data to bear. And I do think that, that will represent a very strong rebuttal to the value propositions of walled gardens and the leverage of first-party data and their ecosystems. Because here, they will get to put their first-party data to work and then measure relative performance, learn from it, take the learnings with them so that they can continue to improve their marketing and not just outsource advertising and marketing to walled gardens, which has historically been the only option that they have had. So, UID plays a really critical role in the future of the open Internet, and it's doing its job. You bet. Thank you. I am going to have Tim take the first part of the question on the JBPs, then I will add some color and talk about Asia. Thanks Tim. Well, said, I don't have anything to add on the JBPs. I am excited to weigh in on Asia, though, because I really appreciate your question. And of course, we are also all sitting here in Singapore and nearing our 10-year anniversary of being here in the Asia market where we started here in Singapore. So, we have a team in our company that we are not an American company, we are a global company that happens to be based in the United States. And can we be successful in Asia, my response is we already are. 11 markets in CTV or premium video grew faster than the United States for us. So, when I say 11 markets, I am not \u2013 I am not talking about it in general. I am talking about The Trade Desk markets. Our spend grew faster in 11 markets for premium video outside the United States than it did inside the United States, the fastest region for growth around the world, Southeast Asia. It grew faster than Australia grew faster than North Asia, grew faster than Europe. It grew faster or South America. And that's in large part because we are \u2013 just like in every other market, creating alternatives, especially UGC, where YouTube has a very dominant position in many of the markets here. But also you are seeing from the content creators that historically, they have had sort of a regional benefit where there is licensing that has prevented U.S. companies from competing with them in their markets. But one of the reasons why you have seen Australia a close rival to leading in terms of size or percentage of market moving to CTV with the U.S., those two leading the way is because with English language content that no longer having regional barriers, but English content is competing all over the world. And the same thing is happening with Chinese content and all others. So, what you are seeing is that the content owners are no longer viewing their next door neighbor in sort of broadcast as their biggest competitors, but instead looking at companies like Disney and Netflix is their biggest competitors around the world. So, they are all looking at the ad-funded options that those companies are creating around the world and saying that we quickly have to follow in order to compete. And so as a result, we are getting partnerships all over the world. We are setting up partnerships. That is the reason our executive team is here in Asia is because it's not lost on us, but most of the GDP growth for the next 10 years is going to come out of Asia. And that in order for us to capture our fair share of that $1 trillion TAM, we have to be competitive in Asia as well as in other regions of the world. We are already doing that. And we have been doing that in this market despite things like the strong dollar and economic headwinds and some geopolitical issues, but we continue to do that because of strong partnership and a global mindset. And of course, we represent most of the largest brand in the world. And whether you are talking about Procter & Gamble or Coca-Cola or McDonald's, these brands advertise all over the world, and it's not lost on them that GDP growth is going to come out of Asia. It's not lost on them that the fastest-growing middle class in the world is here in Asia. So, you put all of that together, it's a market that we are already winning in and we will continue to do so. We have over invested. If you look at our employee count versus our revenue, of course, we are early, not late. And that's a good thing, not a bad thing. Thank you."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. First, it was great to see so many of you at our Investor Day last month in New York City. We always appreciate the opportunity to dive deeper into the drivers of our business and discuss our strategy in more detail. As our performance in Q3 shows we continue to execute extremely well in the current environment. We continue to grab share and significantly outpace our peers. We again delivered year-over-year revenue growth well into the double-digits, while many companies in the ad funded space have seen low single-digit or even negative year-over-year revenue growth. We have also managed our expenses efficiently, delivering strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Once again, our results reflect the continued shift from advertisers toward data-driven advertising and the open Internet as they continue to shift away from linear channels and walled gardens. Revenue in Q3 was $395 million, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty, which we are not immune to, our platform continues to deliver value for advertisers and we are building trust with our clients for the long-term. During the quarter, growth was broad-based across channels and verticals. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We are seeing progress in our shopper marketing business as our customers deploy retail data in more and more of their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results as advertisers utilize Solimar to sharpen campaign goals and activate our industry-leading AI. Q3 was another example of our ability to grow top line while scaling our cost structure efficiently, helping to drive meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, representing a margin of 41%. I'm proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate strong EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that will prepare us for the tighter wave of opportunity ahead while still producing cash flow that helps fund our future growth. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow of nearly $500 million is up 53% from a year ago. While there will always be periods where we may lean into investment due to the opportunity, over the long-term, the best business models in the world generate long-term growth, profits and cash. I'm fortunate to be part of a team that considers all of these in our investment decisions. From a channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q3, video, which includes CTV represented a low 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter as growth was again solid across both in app and mobile video. Display represented a low teens percent of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend, and international represented about 10% of spend in Q3. Spend growth in North America was resilient as we continue to win new business and gain share. CTV across Southeast Asia and Europe was very strong during the quarter, growing faster than in any other region. While still small compared to CTV spend in North America, we're encouraged to see CTV in both Europe and Southeast Asia rapidly increase year-over-year relative to their overall spend. Despite an uncertain macro environment, particularly in Europe, we remain focused on the long-term investments that will position us for strength when conditions improve. In an uncertain environment like today, advertisers become more deliberate with their ad spend, scrutinizing the effectiveness of their ad budgets much more carefully than they have done previously. As we have shown during similar environments in the past, as advertisers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, The Trade Desk wins more budget. Every ad run on our platform is measurable, and we are focused on driving the highest returns for every campaign as our clients are. As we're starting to hear more publicly from the largest and most sophisticated advertisers in the world, they are beginning to prioritize programmatic decision advertising investments first because it delivers higher returns than they have seen in other channels. And on top of that, our company's unbiased partnership with them and that we don't own inventory, we don't compete with our customers, and we offer an unrivaled data marketplace where they can inspect, measure and enhance campaigns in ways that walled gardens either refuse to offer or merely cannot match, creates a durable advantage that we believe makes the future very bright for us and for our customers. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend travel more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink, automotive and technology were also very strong. Our automotive vertical is seeing a bit of a resurgence as a result of winning new business with large automotive manufacturers and the easing of supply chain issues the industry has seen over the better part of the last 2.5 years. Hobbies and interest in education were both below the average. Additionally, as expected, political was strong and represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3. We continue to believe there is still potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Q3 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $245 million, up 32% year-over-year. Operating expenses during the quarter were primarily driven by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing as we scale prudently to support long-term growth as well as return to office expenses. Income tax was $15 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income was $129 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $137 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $112 million. DSOs exit in the quarter were 92 days, up 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 74 days, up 1 day from a year ago. We exited Q3 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $490 million, which would represent growth of 24% on a year-over-year basis. In Q4, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to about double compared with the prior quarter. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $229 million in Q4. From a stock-based compensation perspective, we expect absolute stock-based compensation expense to decline year-over-year in Q4 due to the timing of the CEO performance award granted in Q4 of 2021. While uncertainty about the macro environment remains, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and gain share in the quarters and years ahead. Given the large and growing addressable market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to prudently invest in our business to innovate and to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive both profitable growth and achieve significant share gains with large growth drivers, including the secular shift to CTV, attracting more shopper marketing budgets, scaling our international operations to be ready when the macro environment improves, innovating the data marketplace, the U.S. midterm election cycle as well as elevated pressure on walled gardens, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Hey, thanks, Shyam, for the question. So your question on Q4, just to start off on Q3, again, fundamentally great quarter, actually pretty steady, too, which was great to see 31% revenue growth off a relatively hard comp last year of 39%. And political has ramped up for us as well. So like you've already seen standout performance versus peers who are growing at much smaller or negative rates, again, CTV led the way, still opportunity there. Shopper marketing is ramping up well for us, too. The Solimar adoption is exciting. We've got the momentum on UID as well. And so just grabbing share from company zone, and you've heard us talk about these JBPs as well. That's also been ramping and has been strong. And so as you think about, as when we think about going into Q4 in our setup, again, relative to the rest of the industry in Q4, we're growing significantly faster, which, in my mind, just confirms we're grabbing share. Advertisers are be more deliberate. I just personally believe we're in a better position now than we were coming out of COVID. As a Chief Financial Officer or CFO, I definitely appreciate the uncertainty that so many of my peers are facing right now, right? Like the best CFOs are actively working to rationalize the investments that they are making and they are prioritizing the ones that have proven measurable returns. And in that environment, The Trade Desk we gained share because companies are now prioritizing programmatic as the first place to invest that first dollar. So while you can obviously dial programmatic up and down quickly, it's doing really well for us. And to me, that just shows the power and the value of this model. Now specifically with regards to Q4 a couple of thoughts, not only is our Q4 sequential growth well into the double digits as many app funded companies are flat or negative. We're actually forecasting accelerating growth on a year-over-year basis in Q4. And I recognize that there's a political impact in there. But when I just step back a bit and look at a year-over-year acceleration in Q4 in this environment, to me, that's a standout performance for us and it gives us a lot of optimism about our future and the momentum that we've got. And I hope that helps. Sure. Hi, Youssef, thanks for the question. So with regards to thinking about expense structure in 2023 and such I really just like stepping back a bit to remind everyone that the business model in the situation we're in highly desirable, right? We've got a situation where we're driving high top line growth. We've got high adjusted EBITDA growth with strong margins. And we've got not only strong free cash flow generation, but consistent free cash flow generation. So having all of those working together, which they are, it gives us an opportunity and ability to be deliberate with the choices that we make. I'm just also super proud of our ability to stay disciplined with our investments regardless of the operating environment. I \u2013 there's a lot of companies out there that might have more resources than us that are pausing or even cutting their resources because they potentially invested too aggressively. And we didn't get ahead of ourselves the last couple of years. I think maybe like some of these companies did, and that's paid off for us. We have the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and that includes hiring. As we think about 2023 specifically, should we see any significant changes in the situation, we definitely have levers available to make changes if we need to. You saw us do that in 2020 during COVID, we can adapt. But still, the expense structure of the company today is better than it was pre-pandemic. But overall though, and I've said this on a number of calls, we're always looking for ways to invest and drive growth that we think pays off for the long run. For 2023 specifically, I would say a couple of things. We do expect return-to-office expenses like travel and live events to return to pre COVID levels. And the other thing to keep in mind is I would expect seasonality of our expenses next year to be a bit more like 2016 to 2019 than they were in 2020, 2021. And just for example, we have our large company event that will finally move back to its regular timing in Q1, it was held in Q2 of this year. That's just a great opportunity to bring our team together, especially after what's gone on in the past few years, whether we're solidifying our culture, framing our strategy versus the opportunity we've got. And also just highlighting, again, the discipline perspective we take as a company about driving profitable growth. So looking into 2023, I think we're in a great position to drive more scale and efficiency and free cash flow. And we have so many opportunity areas to focus on. I'm really excited about that. And then... And then, Justin, just on your question on the Q4 trend, one way maybe to think about it is, it's a little bit of a tale of two cities like and you have heard us say this before, like or a cave shape recovery, if you will, for certain verticals. Some areas like travel and auto are outperforming and they are making up for lost time. Some areas are more challenged. You have heard us talk about Europe, but as we have said that before. But specific to Europe, as we have said, we have seen incredible CTV growth there, which is amazing in light of the macro challenges. So, it makes me super optimistic for the future for us there. And then the automotive growth, especially it's been especially exciting to see some gains there. We have won new business and then some more existing from existing customers after a period of volatility over the past 2-or-so years. And so I think that \u2013 and then even if you talk about CPG companies, you got some that are doing incredibly well and then some that still have some supply chain challenges as well. So, I think that the breadth of the advertisers and the verticals that we represent bodes super well for us and like there is still areas of opportunity for us to gain share there, too."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth. Sir, the floor is yours.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you, that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. In particular, our expectations around any macroeconomic deceleration, potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in various regions where we operate, in addition to potential supply chain disruptions that could disrupt advertising spend in our platform, are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the Risk Factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found on our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company\u2019s operational performance. Lastly, I would like to highlight that we are planning to hold an Analyst Day on Tuesday, October 4, 2022 in New York City. This event will be webcast and available on our Investor Relations website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you\u2019ve seen from the press release, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter. We grew revenue 35% compared with last year and we outpaced our competitors and continued to gain market share, despite some macroeconomic uncertainty. In the first half of the year, marketers shifted to decision data driven advertising on the open Internet more rapidly than ever. And as a result, the Trade Desk has become increasingly indispensable as the default DSP for the open Internet and Connected TV. Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of our business through the first half of this year has been the rate at which we sign new and expanded joint business plans or JBPs with our clients. I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on this dynamic in the past, but I\u2019d like to today, because I think this trend says a lot about how we are winning in the market and why that gives us optimism for the future and confidence that we can execute in any market environment. Joint business plans, or JBPs, our long-term deals that we sign with leading brands who aim to increase spend on our platform often over a multi-year period. In many cases, these agreements are signed with the partnerships and cooperation of the agencies that represent the brands. So as we continue to move upstream and get more direct commitments from CMOs and brand marketers, it is not at the expense of our valuable agency relationships. In the second quarter, we signed new and expanded JBPs at a record rate covering many verticals. For example, there were new agreements with some of the world\u2019s largest automakers and technology companies along with significantly expanded deals with large global CPGs. Many people looking at our results, including those in the advertising industry are asking how we are winning and growing at this pace in the current environment. There are a few vectors and macro factors that are creating an amazing opportunity for us to grow into a much bigger company and wind share regardless of the economic environment. I\u2019d like to take a minute to identify those macro factors that are providing wind at our back. First, there is a secular tailwind that continues to propel us forward, and that\u2019s the worldwide shift to advertising fueled connected television. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever experienced a secular tailwind like this before. CTV is evolving faster than anyone predicted. And if we continue to execute, I believe we will benefit as much as any company in the world from this tailwind, just like we did in Q2 and through most of the pandemic. The second macro factor that is helping us grab share is that walled gardens like Google\u2019s ad network are being downgraded in priority. For most of the last two decades, when dollars move over from offline spending to online spending, they have gone first to Google and other walled gardens. One way to define a walled garden is to think about an internet publisher or a content destination that is so large and dominant in their content segment, that they can be draconian to advertisers and still win business. Google\u2019s advertising products are a textbook example. Many have pointed out that Google does its own performance measurement. They have run marketplaces with questionable integrity and fairness, but they win advertising budgets because of their dominant position and their size and footprint around the world. CTV has started to change this dynamic in our industry though, because no one in CTV is big enough to be as dominant in TV as Google has been with search or with Chrome or double click, their ad server that is almost irreversibly integrated into the Google ad network machine. As a result, the marketplace for premium CTV is fair, especially in relative terms and extremely competitive, because of the efficacy of moving picture and sound coupled with these competitive market dynamics for the first time ever, some of the biggest brands in the world have a new place to spend their first dollar on the Internet, which is premium CTV. CTV is fast becoming a must buy. And in some cases, the highest stack rank part of the digital media plan for many brands. This trend is changing the makeup of the whole Internet, and it is likely to change the role of walled gardens in our industry, especially the smaller walled gardens. So the bottom line on this second major macro trend, the draconian tactics of walled gardens are now being challenged because of the competitive nature of CTV as advertisers increasingly prioritize premium CTV content. And lastly, I\u2019d like to talk briefly about the third macro force that is changing the landscape before I come back to us, The Trade Desk and what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re taking advantage of these trends. The third macro trend that is creating market opportunity for us is the worldwide pressure on Google. There has been a great deal of regulatory scrutiny of Google over the past couple years. We\u2019ve seen the reports of investigations and complaints from the Department of Justice, the states attorneys general concerning various forms of alleged antitrust violations in Google\u2019s ads business, but it\u2019s not just here in the United States, it\u2019s also in various other countries around the world. Recently, the UK\u2019s competitive market authority or the CMA announced it is investigating whether Google has broken the law by restricting competition in digital advertising in the UK. As the CMA Chief Executive, Andrea Coscelli said, and I quote, we\u2019re worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favor its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers. Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs. It may also be raising costs for advertisers, which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services. So let me be very clear about this point. The Trade Desk stands to gain share no matter the outcome of these investigations or lawsuits. I believe Google\u2019s biggest obstacle to compete in programmatic and in CTV is their lack of objectivity. By contrast, we don\u2019t own any inventory and we can partner with everyone in CTV. That gives us a level of objectivity that Google can\u2019t overcome as long as it owns YouTube and its search engine, its core assets and continues to operate on both the buy side and the sell side. Advertisers are increasingly aware of the very concerns that the CMA is raising. Especially, the large brand advertisers and their agencies that today constitute the majority of spend on our platform. As a result, I\u2019m confident we will do well, regardless of Google\u2019s moves in programmatic and with DV360, their demand side platform or DSP. In addition to thinking about The Trade Desk and how we gain share, I am often asked to speak about the open internet more broadly. When I put that hat on and speak on behalf of the open Internet. I do get concerned about what Google has done to make it much harder for companies smaller than The Trade Desk to compete in the open Internet. I\u2019m concerned that the press and regulators are too focused on what assets Google owns or should own and instead should apply more scrutiny to Google\u2019s behaviors, their incentives, their structure and their tactics. But that\u2019s for another day, I believe so long as we execute The Trade Desk is going to do well, regardless of what tactics Google deploys. Even when Google plays unfairly, as some regulators have alleged, it tends to move advertisers and agencies to us. This is one of the reasons we are reporting such a good quarter today and why we\u2019re so optimistic about our future. So with that, let\u2019s shift gears to discuss our strategy, our tactics, and how we\u2019re executing. So let\u2019s discuss what\u2019s happening inside The Trade Desk. Across the company, we\u2019re very clear on our mission and we\u2019re extremely focused on helping agencies and advertisers as we always have been. We are focused on the buy side and our goals are clear to be the objective open Internet alternative to walled gardens, to pioneer a new approach to decision TV ad buying, to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet and to create a better open Internet for everyone, including us to enable brands to safely and easily deploy their first party data and to add more value by creating a more efficient supply chain. It\u2019s because of these factors that more and more of the world\u2019s leading advertisers are embracing our platform compared to our competitors. It\u2019s also why you saw a string of key partnership announcements forged in the second quarter, whether it\u2019s Disney partnering with us as they race to ensure that the majority of their ad impressions are automated or Amazon\u2019s AWS ensuring that the many brands who use their marketing data services can now transact on UID2. The same with Experian who\u2019s using UID2 as a common currency, where Albertsons becoming the latest retail media partner on our platform to improve measurement and insight for brands, selling products at Albertsons. And of course, Albertsons has committed to using UID2 to do this. I also want to talk about Netflix recent moves. I believe they are in a very strong position to be a leader in AVOD and hybrid pricing models, similar to how they led the way for more than a decade in SVOD. We have a great relationship with Netflix. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We\u2019ve had many constructive conversation with Netflix over the last few months. I personally am very impressed with how quickly they are diving into advertising. The Netflix partnership with Microsoft is very positive news for the open Internet, the fact that Netflix didn\u2019t choose Google is very telling. We believe it\u2019s another strong indication that more industry leaders recognize the opportunity of the open Internet compared to the dangers and limitations of walled gardens. By partnering with Microsoft on the supply side of the digital advertising equation, Netflix controls its own destiny. They chose a partner that can represent their interests, not one with a conflict of interest. Xandr is a strong sell side partner and has been a great partner of ours for years. In fact, almost 12 years ago, I initiated the partnership between Microsoft and AppNexus, the company they now own that has been renamed Xandr. Netflix and Xandr have a lot of ground to cover. Once they\u2019ve done the work on the supply side, driving as much demand as possible toward those ad impressions will come next. Over time, Netflix is very well positioned to open their ad inventory on the demand side to the open Internet. That would enable demand side players to compete in an open, objective and decision market, driving high CPMs and maximizing the value for both the advertiser and the publisher in this case Netflix. They will need to figure out how to do what Disney and their properties like Hulu are doing so well right now, which is creating a personalized TV and ad experience that respects consumer privacy. Disney is setting the pace on this today, which sets a model for what technologically savvy media companies like Netflix and NBCU and Paramount and so many others are likely to pursue very quickly as well. As you know, I predicted publicly and repeatedly many years ago that Netflix and other subscription CTV leaders would eventually offer some kind of ad supported option. The economics of the market demanded. And so many streaming providers have proved how attractive CTV is to advertisers. We work with almost all of them. For example, one of our early CTV partners NBC continues to go from strength to strength on our platform with fully biddable inventory now available across its entire portfolio, including Peacock, which is driving significant interest and growth from our advertisers. The same is true of other premium CTV pioneers, including Discovery+ and HBO Max, which went live recently as well. As a result of our work with the world\u2019s leading CTV pioneers, The Trade Desk is now the largest demand source for decision premium CTV advertising. And CTV is now reaching the kind of scale where it is forcing change across the advertising ecosystem. CTV leaders will help forge the future of identity. It\u2019s where we will dislodge the bricks of the walled gardens most rapidly. It\u2019s where advertisers now have globally scaled premium content alternatives to user generated content. And because CTV has a massive authenticated logged in user base is where advertisers and publishers will innovate new ways to create personalized experiences while also improving consumer privacy and better explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet. There is arguably no company on the planet that cares more about consumer privacy than Disney. They\u2019ve spent decades building a brand based on intentional, personalized, experience across all of their channels, but as they do that, they also want to ensure that their consumer\u2019s privacy is highly protected. As you\u2019ve seen Disney recently announced and expanded global partnership with The Trade Desk. And as a key part of that partnership, Disney will become interoperable with UID2 across all channels. As you know, Disney engages consumers in many different ways, all of which are incorporated into their audience graph, which is now interoperable with UID2. Aaron LaBerge the President and CTO of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, perhaps set at best and I quote. The growth of our relationship with The Trade Desk is a milestone in addressability and automated buy net scale, and the latest step as we use technology to enable advertisers to buy once to deliver everywhere across Disney. I want to spend a moment on why UID2 is so important. A couple of weeks ago, Google announced that they are delaying the demise of third-party cookies in Chrome until at least the second half of 2024. If you\u2019ve been paying attention to anything we\u2019ve said over the last couple of years at The Trade Desk, you\u2019ll understand how completely predictable this announcement was. I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m not sure it is ever in Google\u2019s best interest to get rid of third-party cookies, but it ultimately doesn\u2019t really matter that much. The uncertainty around Google\u2019s decision making is only hardening the resolve of the rest of the industry to develop new approaches to identity. It is shortsighted to think about this work as simply a replacement for cookies that doesn\u2019t really capture the scope of what\u2019s going on. And Disney is a great example of this. Disney wants to pioneer new ways to create highly personal experiences that protect consumer privacy across all channels. In most of those channels, cookies are not even present. It\u2019s much bigger than cookies. CTV does not rely on cookies. Successful consumer-oriented companies are taking a holistic approach to the consumer across all experiences and designing something new. Marketers understand that key marketing objectives such as reach frequency and data usage and privacy can be managed in a much more deliberate and decisioned and holistic manner. Part of the reason that Disney can act with confidence here, is because we\u2019ve already done the hard work of activating UID2 across the data infrastructure that\u2019s something of this central nervous system of digital advertising. AWS is a great illustration of this. AWS recently announced that they will enable their customers to deploy UID2 to help liberate the customer data stored on their platform. And AWS is one of the largest aggregators of marketing data in the world. If an advertiser uses AWS already, they can use UID2 to create an identifier that helps put that data to work without any of the data ever leaving AWS. AWS is just the latest infrastructure leader to deploy UID2. They are joining other leaders that include Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, and Snowflake to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet. The latest major data player to join this movement is Experian. Experian marketing services is one of the leading suppliers of marketing data and insights to advertisers and they are now using UID2 for their third-party data sets. As we\u2019ve said all along, the success of UID2 will never hinge on ringing 10,000 door bills. First and foremost, it\u2019s about gaining traction with the infrastructure of the ad tech industry. And with that infrastructure in place, it is much easier for advertisers and publishers to activate because UID2 is already embedded in the tools they rely on. In a world with better identity solutions like UID2 instead of cookies, publishers will make more money per ad. Advertisers will need pure more relevant ads to make an impact and sell product. Consumers will have more privacy and more control over their privacy. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m confident that almost all of our customers will be transacting on UID2 by the end of this year. As I said, at the beginning of my remarks, we are highly encouraged by our performance and optimistic about our ability to outpace the market moving forward. The combination of macro trends and our own innovation enables us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Of course, we understand many of our customers are dealing with uncertainty, but even with that uncertainty, we remain focused and confident. Programmatic advertising first came of age during the global financial crisis between 2007 and early 2009. We launched The Trade Desk right in the heart of the uncertainty in 2009, while we are not immune to macroeconomic weakness, we gain share coming out of the uncertainty during the early months of the COVID pandemic. And it\u2019s because in times of uncertainty and volatility, when marketers have to make the most of every advertising dollar, that we have an opportunity to demonstrate our value. Our customers recognize that efficient and decision advertising can play a critical role in differentiating their brands to specific audiences and specific times. And there\u2019s no better platform on which to do that than The Trade Desk. Throughout the first half of 2022, and particularly in the second quarter, I believe we have gained more market share or grabbed more land than at any period in our history. And in large part that\u2019s because as marketers become more deliberate with their budgets, they are prioritizing, advertising that delivers the highest return and CTV has moved up the priority list. So, while we can\u2019t control the macroeconomic environment, the pace at which we are signing new and expanded customer agreements indicates that we are becoming an indispensable partner in their business growth and we anticipate grabbing land regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We will never rest on our laurels, as one of the few high growth tech companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow we have the financial flexibility to invest so that we can innovate for our customers. Last year on 7/7, we launched our biggest platform upgrade in our company\u2019s history. A year later, a 100% of our customers are now using our Solimar platform. With all the data, the measurement and decisioning benefits that Solimar brings them. This is perhaps our greatest engineering achievement yet. Within Solimar, our data marketplace continues to expand rapidly. Many leading retailers are now integrated with our platform, including Walgreens, Albertsons, and Target and we continue to see utilization growth from both endemic and non-endemic advertisers. We continue to innovate to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet, whether it\u2019s the data infrastructure work that\u2019s already proving so successful in North America or the early work around EUID in Europe, which is already gaining very encouraging traction. We continue to see success from brands working with the Walmart DSP with significant quarter-over-quarter growth and the strongest quarter yet. And in CTV, we are already beta testing our forward market product. We\u2019re working with select streaming platforms and advertisers to bring this new approach to CTV decisioning in advance of next year\u2019s upfront and early results are very positive. A strong forward market should replace the upfront market and provide a better TV experience for the whole ecosystem. Our early adopter advertisers are seeing excellent win rates and they want to commit larger budgets to it. And publishers are gaining confidence that this should become an essential component of monetizing their inventory. As I said, at the outset, the transformational impact of CTV, the revolutionary approaches to identity and growing instability in some of our walled garden competition will only accelerate our ability to deliver value and to continue to gain share. I could not be more excited about the work ahead of us in the second half of this year and in the years ahead. And with that, I\u2019ll pass the baton to Blake, who\u2019ll give you more color on the quarter.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon everyone. As you have seen in our results, Q2 was a very strong quarter. Revenue was $377 million representing an increase of 35% year-over-year. Our top-line growth of 35% is especially impressive, given we are comparing against a prior year growth rate of over 100% in Q2 of 2021. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty and we are not immune to it, we continue to gain share as more and more advertisers seek efficiency and measurable results in their ad spent, particularly in CTV. We also benefit from the diversity of our business model, including not only the breadth of advertisers and verticals we represent, but also the range of inventory we have access to across the open internet, which provides a long-term durability we are proud of. During the quarter, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is shifting increasingly towards data driven buying and measurable results. Growth was broad-based across channels and verticals this quarter. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We\u2019ve successfully completed a full transition to Solimar and our customers continue to see positive results as they utilize our platform to sharpen campaign goals, activate our industry-leading AI and leverage more data elements per impression. We are also seeing progress in our shopper marketing business. We have brought new partners into the platform over the past few months, and we are pleased to see increasing interest and adoption from advertisers utilizing shopper data in their campaigns. Although, it is still very early days for us spend that utilizes our expanding shopper data lineup continues to ramp very well. With the continued strong top-line performance in Q2, we generated $139 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 37% of revenue. When we outperform on the top-line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, as it did again, in Q2. I\u2019m proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate meaningfully positive EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that can drive our future growth. This was particularly true in Q2 as items such as our first live companywide event and over three years, resumed and travel also continued to ramp up. From a channel perspective, CTV via a wide margin, let our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q2 video, which includes CTV represented a low-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter, and display and audio continued to represent about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend. Spend in North America maintained its resiliency, as we continue to win new business and gain share. In particular, our Chicago office, which is our second largest office behind New York, grew spend faster on a year-over-year basis than any other office in the world that represents at least 1% of our spend, fantastic results by that team as we continue to expand our reach. Our international spend grew both sequentially and year-over-year, but dropped slightly as a percent of overall mix. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America, as was the case again in Q2. However, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, CTV spend in Europe, again more than doubled year-over-year. Despite a challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe, we are focused on making the long-term investment so will position us to be stronger when conditions improve. As we have proven in the past, as our customers become more deliberate and data driven with their ad spend much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help customers achieve better ROI and win more of their budget. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend nearly all of them groom the double digits during the quarter, both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink and technology were also very strong with food and drink accelerating on a year-over-year basis every month during the quarter. Home and garden and automotive grew slower than the average however, both verticals grew faster than the average in July. Additionally automotive still grew the double-digits in Q2 and accelerated in growth from Q1. We continue to believe that there is the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses, Q2 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation were $250 million up 45% year-over-year. Growth and operating expenses is influenced by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development. As we continue to build the platform for long-term growth, as well as the return of in-person events. Income tax was $21 million for the second quarter. The higher amount of tax relative to prior quarters was driven primarily by lower benefits from stock based awards, the timing of which are variable. Adjusted net income was $99 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $92 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $86 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days up nine days from a year ago. DPOs were 73 days up six days from a year ago. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments ended the quarter at $1.2 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $385 million, which would represent growth of 28% on a year-over-year basis. In Q3, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to represent a low single-digit share as a percent of our business. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $140 million in Q3. While there\u2019s continued uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and take share. Given the large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business. In more uncertain times, this enables us to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the quarter with significant growth drivers, including CTV, retail media, our international business, Solimar as well as the U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about our future prospects. We continue to generate strong annual free cash flow and the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well as we enter the second half of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. The first question is coming from Shyam Patil from Susque. Your line is live.\nShyam Patil: Hey guys, congrats on the results and the outlook. Jeff, I wanted to ask, this is now the second quarter in a row where your results and outlook are significantly better than, what we\u2019re seeing from other app supported companies, especially in the face of a slowing macro. And I was just wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about, what you think is driving that outperformance? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Well, so first let me just say, I\u2019m incredibly proud of our Q3, r the start to our Q3 and especially our performance in Q2. But let me just highlight just a couple of the things that have really gone our way in Q2 and given us so much momentum going into Q4 or going into Q3 and Q4. First, we have an amazing secular tailwind of CTV, arguably the best secular tailwind we\u2019ve ever had. Second, we are of course, seeing the benefits of Solimar, which we\u2019ve gone to a 100% and it just has all these benefits to our clients. Third, we\u2019ve got this, this momentum around the joint business plans where we\u2019re just getting closer to brands and we\u2019re creating better partnerships with each of them. And one of the things that they\u2019re excited about is just our relationships in shopper marketing, the overall call, we started with the very biggest retailer in the world in Walmart and we just continued to expand on that. We highlighted some of those included Albertsons during the prepared remarks. But I do want to emphasize that we have never claimed to be a bellwether of the economy or of advertising yet. And what I mean by that is, I think a lot of times people look at our performance and say, how is this so different than everybody else\u2019s? And what is often happening is, we are winning because of those secular tailwinds and because programmatic is growing share and because digital is growing share and meanwhile it is possible to have some macroeconomic headwinds in our face and have a secular tailwind of CTV and all the things I just talked about that, that overshadow that. And I think what we are seeing right now is just an amazing trend, which is that, that CTV in particular is extremely competitive. It\u2019s also extremely effective. And so, as people are looking for alternatives to walled gardens they are looking to companies like us, who can give them objectivity to buy across all these fragmented places. Many of the smaller walled gardens, I think are especially under pressure. And as I\u2019ve said, I think CTV can be the thing that brings down the walled gardens. But that\u2019ll start with those that are smallest. So, I think often, we\u2019re being compared to walled gardens of various sizes, and I don\u2019t necessarily think that the fair comparison, and of course, I think we\u2019re also in anomaly from the macro. So, hopefully that par is out all those things, but I\u2019m really proud of what we did in Q2 and really optimistic about our Q3.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Shyam.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov [Cannonball]. Your line is live.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Just to follow up maybe on this, on the first question, can you, Jeff, please talk about what\u2019s going on in Connected TV. I\u2019m sure, that some Connected TV players reported fairly slow growth in Q2 and guided to continued slow growth in the remainder of the year. So and if I listen to your remarks and assuming that your Connected TV spend is growing at least double your overall spend, that would imply at least 50% growth. So can you explain to us, how to understand that what the diversification is about and does the quick follow up there, maybe you can tell us about how you use the terms scatter market and spot market in Connected TV that sort of became a thing this earning season?\nJeff Green: Yes, no problem first. And thanks for the question. So, as I mentioned, CTV is a secular tailwind that it continues to help drive our business. I would even say it continues to lead our business, including our growth. The scale that we\u2019re seeing is amazing. And the changes in the world, including the pandemic, which made everybody stay home and stream a lot more, have created changes to the ecosystem that I don\u2019t think anybody predicted. And, if you just take a step back and you think about if five years ago, you would\u2019ve thought that HBO and Netflix would be showing ads I think a lot of people were public about saying that isn\u2019t going to happen and it\u2019s happening now, so there are these tailwinds that I just can\u2019t overstate. And that as a result, CTV is often becoming the place where the very first dollar it is spent. But one of the things, I really like about your question and it gives me a platform to talk about is, okay, well then why isn\u2019t everyone in CTV seeing the same sort of growth that you are seeing? And there are a couple reasons for that one. There are some companies that are deployed the walled garden strategy, which is that I have something special either on my operating system or on my channel, and you should buy that exclusively through me. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, no one in CTV has a position that is strong enough to be draconian the same way that you can in other parts of digital like search or social or some of those others. So as a result those tactics, I think are proving more difficult as more and more choices are coming online. So a platform that sits objectively and helps people choose across the 20, 30, 40 places where you can buy, I mean, think of your own habits as a consumer, you were probably watching CTV on two or three apps five years ago. Now you\u2019re probably watching them on seven, eight, nine, 10 plus that fragmentation creates a greater need for somebody to centrally partner with all of them measure, reach, and frequency and performance across all of them, and has to have a business model that is eligible to partner with everybody. So that\u2019s why I would argue that we have outperformed everybody else is that unique position and that unique strategy that we\u2019ve deployed as it relates to scatter versus spot and there, I know in this earning season, there has been some discussion about scatter, let me just break it down really simply, scatter is a reference to linear or traditional television where you buy things in upfront, those things that either don\u2019t work out as planned or need to be adjusted to you create this middle market, where you\u2019re buying traditional television with traditional budgets in not very sophisticated, quickly adapt market. Separately from that is a spot market. And what I would call the spot market is the programmatic market that we operate in. And so when people talk about scatter and spot, especially because when they\u2019re talking to people in the financial industry, they can draw analogies to equities. That don\u2019t seem that different, but really what we\u2019re talking about in television one is very closely associated with the upfront market, which was invented in the 60s. The other one we\u2019re talking about digital that brings all of the data and decisioning to bear that, that the internet can really offer that is what makes it so television is going to get better and better, which is there are going to be fewer ads. They are going to be more relevant. There are going to be highly effective. And that funds content at a rate that has never been seen before, that can only be done by a spot market and a forward market, not a legacy upfront market and scatter market. So those are the reasons, why there\u2019s a big difference in rhetoric around scatter versus spot. The spot market is amazingly strong, the strongest it has ever been. And that\u2019s because of the variety of apps that are coming into the ecosystem and the need for ad funded content because all of them need ad dollars in order to continue to fund their content making machines.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Vasily.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. This is James on for Brent. Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, could you just spend a little more talking about \u2013 a little more time talking about what the Disney partnership means for your business? How much access does this deal give you to Disney\u2019s premium CTV inventory and to what magnitude does it grow your footprint for UID? That\u2019s my first question. And my second is for Blake just around hiring plans. We\u2019ve definitely heard a lot of companies in the ad industry pulling back on hiring. So just would love to hear where you guys sit on hiring plans for 2022. Thanks.\nJeff Green: Awesome. Thanks. I\u2019ll go first and I\u2019ll let Blake go and just to order you asked the question. So let me first just reiterate our strategy in UID2. So first, we created UID2. We open sourced it, we gave it to the ecosystem. This is not ours, but it is something that we really want to see successful because we think there needs to be a privacy safe currency that makes it possible for personalization to take place at large scale. That needs to replace cookies, but it also needs to do way more than that. And when people reduce it down to a discussion about replacing cookies, it doesn\u2019t really capture what it\u2019s about. It is a currency of the Internet that makes personalization and privacy control way better than it exists today. The way that you win that way, the way that you fix the infrastructure of the Internet, which can be massively upgraded, especially so that consumers have more control over privacy is that you partner with the infrastructure. Many might mistakenly think the way that you change the infrastructure of the Internet as you partner with millions of publishers or millions of apps or hundreds of content creators in television. And instead, it\u2019s to start with the infrastructure. So the deal with Disney wouldn\u2019t have easily been done if we hadn\u2019t already partnered with Salesforce or Snowflake or a Adobe or AWS, some of those infrastructure plays that make it possible. But because we had it made it easy for us to then have great conversations with Disney. Additionally, Disney has done an amazing job of assembling all of its different assets, including Hulu, which was one of the first Connected TV plays to really understand the benefit of highly relevant ads and high CPMs that come from relevance. And that you of course have to have a strategy around identity and personalization in order to get those high CPMs and in order to get that benefit. So I think one of the things that Disney has really led the way on is making certain that all the way at the top of their technical organization, they have a clear understanding of what it takes to provide personalization and consumer privacy protection and control at the same time. And while doing that, I think that they have made it possible to better monetize Hulu, ESPN, ABC, Disney+, FX, and so many other things that they own. Because they own so many of those and because I think they understand that relationship at the highest levels of the organization, I think this partnership is really significant, because number one, I think Disney has a clear strategy going forward that some others don\u2019t. And two, I think we\u2019ve established ourselves as a great partner of theirs, and we continue to provide them with an amazing amount of demand and high CPMs that is going to fuel their business and better content. Because they represent such a significant amount of the inventory, and especially because almost everything in CTV is logged in, this represents a massive step forward for UID for an authenticated Internet for a better internet. And when you look at extended runway for cookies going away, as well as just the need for CTV to get a better at monetizing. This represents a move forward for everyone. So I do think Disney is proving itself to be a leader once again. So it\u2019s hard to overstate the significance of the partnership. Blake?\nBlake Grayson: Yes, sure. James, regarding your question on the hiring, I just would take just a real quick moment to step back a little bit. If we think about where we are in our business, we have \u2013 we\u2019re in one of the greatest situations I think a company could ask for, right. We\u2019ve got high top line growth, high EBITDA growth with strong margins and we also generate solid consistent annual free cash flow. And so having those three things operating together for me, it\u2019s got super special meaning as you can imagine. And what it does is it gives us the opportunity and the ability to be deliberate with our choices. And in doing so, I\u2019m also proud of our ability to stay disciplined with those investments, regardless of the operating environment that we\u2019re in. You mentioned what other companies are doing. And based on what we\u2019re hearing, well, there are many of our peers that might have more resources, that are pausing, hiring or cutting investments because they invested too aggressively. We didn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves the last couple years like I \u2013 it sounds like many companies did. And I think that\u2019s really paid off for us. It\u2019s given us the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and including hiring, which is one of the largest ones that we will entertain. And so like we mentioned earlier this year, we expect to increase the pace of our investments as we focus on the long-term growth of the business, but we\u2019re always going to stay mindful of long-term productivity supported by our business model. So with regards to hiring and how it affects expenses and such, our Q2 EBITDA was super strong and that included our first full company in-person event that we had in over three years. Our Q3 forecast reflects that investment thesis that we can continue to generate strong EBITDA and invest for the long-term. And we\u2019re focused in hiring in areas that fuel our growth, whether that\u2019s engineering or business development or account management roles. And so I\u2019m comfortable with the trajectory that we\u2019re on and where things stand. And I really think that we can pursue those investments in an operating expense structure that we believe is actually better than pre-pandemic. So I really like the position we\u2019re in to drive more efficiency, more EBITDA and free cash flow, but also as we scale. And so I\u2019m really excited about our situation there.\nJeff Green: Thanks, James.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is live.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. And obviously congrats on a really strong performance all things considered. Jeff with the \u2013 with Netflix going with Microsoft and Xandr being SSP, but also DSP itself. What does that mean for the Trade Desk opportunity with Netflix over time? And as there is going to be a great deal of inventory coming into the CTV market from Netflix, and I guess others just, could that be a depressing factor for pricing for Connected TV in the short and medium-term? Then Blake, maybe just a quick one with Solimar\u2019s adoption at now a 100%. I think that\u2019s what you said in the prepared remarks. Anyway to help quantify the contribution of that software upgrade to the outperformance this quarter. Thank you. Thank you so much.\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Youssef for the question. I actually was hoping somebody would ask about Netflix and Microsoft, because I think it\u2019s one of the most exciting scenes that\u2019s happened in our space in it in the quarter. So let me first just restate something that, that Netflix stated on their earnings call, which I think is a direct quote, it\u2019s still early days. So Netflix has been like learning about the advertising business or in the advertising business for only a few months as they\u2019re \u2013 have established a very important, but early partnership. But I \u2013 for one was very excited when I learned that they had selected Microsoft for a number of reasons, as many of you know, I worked at Microsoft before I sold the first ad exchange to Microsoft. I in fact introduced the President of the ads division to \u2013 at the time, the CEO of AppNexus, which later became Xandr. So it\u2019s been a part of my personal journey, as well as the fact that I\u2019ve just been very close to AppNexus and Xandr, of course, Xandr now being owned by Microsoft. Xandr, as you point out Youssef, it has a small DSP, but it is primarily an SSP. They primarily focus on the sell side. If you look at the \u2013 if you were to stack rank the major players of demand for CTV, I think you\u2019d find that we are the largest and somewhere around number 10 near the bottom of the top 10 list would be Xandr in terms of size. I would estimate that they provide less than 10% of the demand to other independent inventory or content companies. So as a result, what I think that means for us and for the open Internet is that the role that Microsoft is going to play for Netflix is one where they are helping them get started. They\u2019re helping them create a clear identity strategy. I think they very clearly are going to have to have a strategy both for identity, as well as for monetization that involves the open Internet. Because this is early days, it\u2019s less important to me about the role the Trade Desk plays with Netflix in the crawl phase than it does in the walk and the run phase. And to me, selecting Microsoft makes it, so it\u2019s nearly inevitable that Netflix will be a part of the open Internet and that they\u2019ll welcome demand from lots of different places. And that will be the only way that they can maximize their inventory and get the highest CPMs possible, as somebody who wants to see Netflix do well and has a strong relationship with Netflix leadership. I think this is a solid plan. It\u2019s a great start. There\u2019s a lot of work ahead of them, but I think that we are extremely likely to have a great partnership with them over the long-term, but there\u2019s a lot of stuff that has to be done in order for Netflix to be the leader in AVOD that they\u2019ve been in SVOD. So \u2013 but I\u2019m looking forward to it.\nBlake Grayson: And then with regards to your question on Solimar is a high. I\u2019m really excited about the traction that we\u2019ve seen that I think the product really separates us from the competition and we did reach a 100% usage. I think that it took us about a year to get there. I think the last major product update check like 50% longer in the amount of time it took. So it\u2019s a real Testament to the team and the value that I think we\u2019re providing the customers that are doing that upgrade. And so on a usage basis, the trends look good like average data elements used per impression, it\u2019s more than doubled for the same customers on our previous platform. Average channel usage has increased over 50%. And then the AI, machine learning element that we have the adoption on that on Solimar, I think it increased around 50% versus the prior platform. And this is all about getting customers a better ROI. If we can do that, they\u2019re going to return again for future campaigns and we think it \u2013 what that does is it spins the flywheel for everybody for us included. And so just really excited about the momentum here and really proud actually what the team was able to deliver.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you, both.\nJeff Green: Thank you, Youssef.\nOperator: Okay. Up next we have Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is live.\nTim Nollen: I peak my interest, especially about the spot market response a few questions ago being a forward market and how it\u2019s different from scatter. You also mentioned in your prepared remarks about a forward market product. I wonder if you could help maybe explain a bit more, what that is. Is this something that sets you up for more of a upfront participation for CTV guaranteed deals next year or maybe just a bit more color on what that is. And then I\u2019m assuming Unified ID 2.0 will factor in to all of this. And you said you\u2019re optimistic about this becoming kind of a transaction standard for this year. Would UID2 be playing a more prominent role in measurement or attribution of CTV ads going forward?\nJeff Green: Thanks for the questions, Tim. So maybe aside from CTV, my favorite topic to talk about is actually forward market. And I especially love to talk about it in the context of investors, just because you live the concept every single day, even though, it\u2019s somewhat more into advertising. So first of all, the upfront this process where you commit to buy ads on television was a process that was created in the early 60s. In fact, we\u2019ve sort of jokingly made comparison, maybe half jokingly made comparison to the fact that the audio cassette was invented the same year that the TV upfronts were and audio cassettes obviously have evolved, we don\u2019t use them anymore in our daily lives, but the upfront hasn\u2019t changed much and the process is exactly the same. You have a party or an event, where you commit dollars to advertising for the better part of the year with the absence of data and transactions like it\u2019s just \u2013 in a way it\u2019s even strange that as an industry it\u2019s still happens that way. I mean, if we had a forward market for tulips, that was exactly the same as it was 400 years ago. We would look for ways to evolve. We would do something different. So the forward market that we\u2019re developing with our partners is much more like a commodities market, where you have forward contracts, you use data and forecasting to get the benefits of commitment. And the thing that is really amazing about TV ads in particular is that publishers are willing to take less money if you\u2019ll commit to buy it in advance. And advertisers are willing to pay more money, if they can have the assurance that they\u2019re going to get it. I mean, imagine, you wouldn\u2019t spend $3 million, $4 million or $5 million to make a Super Bowl ad, if you didn\u2019t know it was going to run during the Super Bowl. So commitments can be a really important part of television. And so as we move to CTVs, there\u2019s no reason to create a rudimentary 1960s version of a forward market. We should create one that leverages all the very best parts of programmatic takes all the learnings of commodities markets and utilizes that very \u2013 the very best things about programmatic. So we\u2019ve developed that its early days, but we have a good commitment from both buyers and sellers to make it possible to create a much better and stronger market. The only way that that works is if you have good forecasting and the only way that that works is if you have a common currency like UID2. So two \u2013 the second part of your question, does UID2 play a significant role in that? Absolutely. Because in order for us to give a common understanding to buyers to sellers, it\u2019s one thing to buy in the spot market where you\u2019re buying an ad for less than a penny in almost every case. It\u2019s another thing to commit hundreds of millions of dollars in advance to buying ads. You need a greater degree of assurance. You need greater transparency. You need visibility that can only come from forecasts where you have a common understanding, common currencies become very important in order to have any market other than a spot market, unless you\u2019re operating in discounts and constantly working on make goods, which is exactly what the upfront and scatter markets do in traditional television. Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Okay. Next we have Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you very much. Let me try two, please. So, Jeff for the business, there have always been several growth factors or growth vectors from international to shopper marketing to CTV to Solimar to UID2. Now with Solimar fully integrated and CTV clearly driving growth. How about the other three, the UID2, international and shopper marketing? Does the extension of cookies \u2013 cookie deprecation change your focus or investment towards UID2? And then how are you thinking about international and shopper marketing in general over the next six to, call it, 18 months. And then a question for Blake, is possible to get the magnitude of contribution from retail or Walmart and other partnerships, as well as political spend for the third quarter. That\u2019s baked in your guide. Thank you very much.\nJeff Green: Yes. So I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve asked about just these other growth drivers and of course, how does UID affect it and especially just how does the deprecation of cookies affect UID and international expansion and shopper marketing? So I\u2019m not certain that we made this as clear as we could\u2019ve in the prepared remarks. Cookies and ads that are bought inside a browser, because cookies are only relevant inside of a browser at least directly relevant inside of a browser, represents a small percentage of our business. Display is a small percentage of our business. It\u2019s \u2013 as a percentage, it\u2019s shrinking, even though, we\u2019ve seen growth, because growth in other areas are growing faster. It\u2019s still continues to shrink. So it\u2019s a small slice of the pie. What are much bigger are things like mobile, which don\u2019t rely on cookies or CTV, which don\u2019t rely on cookies. They have other ways of creating identity. That, of course, in CTV, nearly everything you do is on the other side of a login, meaning you log into Netflix or you log to Amazon or you log into Peacock or Paramount or Hulu before you view content. And that makes it very prone to be interoperable with something like UID2. So there\u2019s no cookie problem to solve in TV, but everybody in TV needs more subscribers, and I believe everybody in TV needs to offer an AVOD solution for those subscribers that would rather pay with their time than with money. And especially when you have to keep providing or making rate hikes in order to pay for incremental content. So the cookie changes don\u2019t slow down UID at all. And in fact, I\u2019ve always said that the biggest threat to the walled gardens is the competitive nature of Connected Television. That\u2019s especially true in identity and the competitive nature of television is really what I think will fuel UID forward faster than anything that happens with cookies delay or not. But the same thing is true internationally. I mean, especially if you look at the places where GDP growth is predicted to be the highest in the world, those are places that are often mobile first, so they\u2019re less reliant on cookies as well, so especially in Asia. So business models that have a holistic approach to identity and can customize ads to think holistically are the ones that are going to do the best, especially for the biggest companies in the world, which is why I think we\u2019re really in a strong position for international growth. And thirdly, as it relates to international, I think it\u2019s fair to say, there\u2019s more likely to be economic headwinds outside the United States than inside the United States. It given that we look at this as land grab time. So there is a big opportunity for us to expand our market share. Even if there are economic headwinds internationally, that we just want to continue to invest in, especially because outside of big competitors like the Google\u2019s of the world where their DSP is not their primary focus for those smaller competitors where being a DSP is their primary focus. They\u2019re often much smaller and can\u2019t afford to make those investments. So there\u2019s a big opportunity for us to expand around the world. And then in shopper marketing, it \u2013 there is this incredible desire, especially inside of CPGs, and CPGs for a whole bunch of reasons, including inflation are under pressure to do more with less. And what can really help them is to see end-to-end. If I show an ad to this person, how did it affect whether they buy it, add a store to see end-to-end, the impact of their spend is extremely valuable to them. And retailers know that that is a way for them to spin their flywheels faster. Initially they looked at it as a way to make more money on selling data, but now they look at it as a way to spin their flywheels faster. And so I think it\u2019s one of the surest ways that we will spin our own flywheel is to continue to enable an open internet where there\u2019s lots of competition and where marketers that sell goods inside of stores, brick-and-mortar stores continue to get the data driven benefits that historically have been reserved for online retailers like Amazon. So, where everybody is looking at competing with Amazon, they know they have to be focused on becoming as data driven or more than they are. And we\u2019re just seeing amazing strides in retail that, that contributes to our shopper marketing strategy. So, we\u2019ve just seen our TAM expand in the short term, just because of this focus of moving to fixing this sort of end-to-end challenge. And I do think it is true that the discussion about the demise of cookies has made that faster, even though it\u2019s a totally different aspect of measurement, but it is improved and accelerated the move to better measurement, which I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any place that\u2019s better off in those places where we\u2019re doing end-to-end measurement and shopper marketing,\nBlake Grayson: And then to follow up sort to on your other questions, I think, on the shopper marketing component, we don\u2019t break out that level of detail in our shopper marketing business. The only thing I could just say is that, we are seeing the spend ramp, it ramped into Q2 is more large brands, test our testing and adopting it and we expect that to continue. I think just the selection opportunity that our customers are going, are now having is going to be a flywheel spin for them that I debate in my head, whether they\u2019re going to be able to get it very many other places, if any. And so I think that\u2019s just such a long-term opportunity for us like Jeff said, I\u2019m just; I\u2019m super excited about it. And then with regards to your question on political, in the midterms, the spend will occur much closer to Election Day than we might find in a presidential year, like we expect to see that start ramping here over the late summer. I would say through November, there\u2019s so many races out there that are going to be competitive, and we\u2019ll just have to see how competitive, whether it\u2019s the House the Senate, governor campaigns or whatnot. I think that our overall expectation, and is that the in Q3, we expected to be a low single-digit percentage spend in Q3. And that was in our prepared remarks as well. But overall just with regards to political, what I would say is, our goal is to it\u2019s to run a better process, it\u2019s to earn trust with our customers. We\u2019ve been building this business over quite a few years. We\u2019ve got really high retention rates with our customers. We do believe, we\u2019re the go to platform for digital advertising now versus maybe other social media platforms. And so we do expect some tailwinds. That\u2019s why we called it out in the guidance, but we\u2019ll have to see how this all unfolds into the back half of the year.\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks.\nJeff Green: And then John, we can squeeze in one more.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is coming from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Brian, your line is live.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks guys for squeezing me in this. Just as a quick follow up to the forwarded market concept. We wanted to ask about refundability or resalability of inventory, if you will. If an advertiser takes delivery, for example, finds out that an impression or a consumer is already a customer Jeff, are you envisioning that advertisers would\u2019ve the ability to resale inventory and any thoughts on the dynamics there in terms of market liquidity, and participation, and really potential financialization of the market? Thanks.\nJeff Green: You bet. So, I think at initially what you\u2019re going to want to see is control from both publishers or content owners and advertisers in terms of who shows up? Who has access to it? But I do think that in the long term, and we\u2019re talking years from now, one way that you can get buyers to sign up is if they buy too much, they can sell it to somebody else. And so I do think it\u2019s possible to see a derivatives market exist sort of on top of that forward market, so that you can essentially transact in the rights to buy those so that you can secure inventory. But making them fungible makes it, or resellable, or both rather, as I think a really important part of the market in the long term. So, I do think that that component will exist in the long-term, but the most important thing in the short term is to take advantage of the fact that you can bring data to bear that publishers want guarantees and all the benefits of programmatic advertisers would like to reserve inventory and have all the benefits of programmatic, which includes the ability for them to bring their data into the equation. In traditional television, as well as in the scatter market, advertisers can\u2019t really bring their own data to the table. So, the forward market would enable them to do that, which would help prices go up and is really going to benefit, both the buyer and the seller. I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of rules that exist for years to prevent the resale of that. But I do think long-term the economic incentives are there for that to exist. It creates an amazing market. And I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any company that\u2019s better positioned to benefit from this market than The Trade Desk, because of the role that we play by looking at everything by looking at nearly all inventory, because we don\u2019t own it. We make it possible to partner with all of it. And I think we can easily become once again, the world leader in providing demand, not just in the spot market, which we already are today, but also in the forward market, which is why we\u2019re working so hard to create it, and leverage the relationships that we\u2019ve been tending to for more than a decade now.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we had a very strong performance in the second quarter. We grew revenue 35% compared with last year and we outpaced our competitors and continued to gain market share, despite some macroeconomic uncertainty. In the first half of the year, marketers shifted to decision data driven advertising on the open Internet more rapidly than ever. And as a result, the Trade Desk has become increasingly indispensable as the default DSP for the open Internet and Connected TV. Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of our business through the first half of this year has been the rate at which we sign new and expanded joint business plans or JBPs with our clients. I haven't spent a lot of time on this dynamic in the past, but I'd like to today, because I think this trend says a lot about how we are winning in the market and why that gives us optimism for the future and confidence that we can execute in any market environment. Joint business plans, or JBPs, our long-term deals that we sign with leading brands who aim to increase spend on our platform often over a multi-year period. In many cases, these agreements are signed with the partnerships and cooperation of the agencies that represent the brands. So as we continue to move upstream and get more direct commitments from CMOs and brand marketers, it is not at the expense of our valuable agency relationships. In the second quarter, we signed new and expanded JBPs at a record rate covering many verticals. For example, there were new agreements with some of the world's largest automakers and technology companies along with significantly expanded deals with large global CPGs. Many people looking at our results, including those in the advertising industry are asking how we are winning and growing at this pace in the current environment. There are a few vectors and macro factors that are creating an amazing opportunity for us to grow into a much bigger company and wind share regardless of the economic environment. I'd like to take a minute to identify those macro factors that are providing wind at our back. First, there is a secular tailwind that continues to propel us forward, and that's the worldwide shift to advertising fueled connected television. I don't know that we've ever experienced a secular tailwind like this before. CTV is evolving faster than anyone predicted. And if we continue to execute, I believe we will benefit as much as any company in the world from this tailwind, just like we did in Q2 and through most of the pandemic. The second macro factor that is helping us grab share is that walled gardens like Google's ad network are being downgraded in priority. For most of the last two decades, when dollars move over from offline spending to online spending, they have gone first to Google and other walled gardens. One way to define a walled garden is to think about an internet publisher or a content destination that is so large and dominant in their content segment, that they can be draconian to advertisers and still win business. Google's advertising products are a textbook example. Many have pointed out that Google does its own performance measurement. They have run marketplaces with questionable integrity and fairness, but they win advertising budgets because of their dominant position and their size and footprint around the world. CTV has started to change this dynamic in our industry though, because no one in CTV is big enough to be as dominant in TV as Google has been with search or with Chrome or double click, their ad server that is almost irreversibly integrated into the Google ad network machine. As a result, the marketplace for premium CTV is fair, especially in relative terms and extremely competitive, because of the efficacy of moving picture and sound coupled with these competitive market dynamics for the first time ever, some of the biggest brands in the world have a new place to spend their first dollar on the Internet, which is premium CTV. CTV is fast becoming a must buy. And in some cases, the highest stack rank part of the digital media plan for many brands. This trend is changing the makeup of the whole Internet, and it is likely to change the role of walled gardens in our industry, especially the smaller walled gardens. So the bottom line on this second major macro trend, the draconian tactics of walled gardens are now being challenged because of the competitive nature of CTV as advertisers increasingly prioritize premium CTV content. And lastly, I'd like to talk briefly about the third macro force that is changing the landscape before I come back to us, The Trade Desk and what we're doing and how we're taking advantage of these trends. The third macro trend that is creating market opportunity for us is the worldwide pressure on Google. There has been a great deal of regulatory scrutiny of Google over the past couple years. We've seen the reports of investigations and complaints from the Department of Justice, the states attorneys general concerning various forms of alleged antitrust violations in Google's ads business, but it's not just here in the United States, it's also in various other countries around the world. Recently, the UK's competitive market authority or the CMA announced it is investigating whether Google has broken the law by restricting competition in digital advertising in the UK. As the CMA Chief Executive, Andrea Coscelli said, and I quote, we're worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favor its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers. Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs. It may also be raising costs for advertisers, which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services. So let me be very clear about this point. The Trade Desk stands to gain share no matter the outcome of these investigations or lawsuits. I believe Google's biggest obstacle to compete in programmatic and in CTV is their lack of objectivity. By contrast, we don't own any inventory and we can partner with everyone in CTV. That gives us a level of objectivity that Google can't overcome as long as it owns YouTube and its search engine, its core assets and continues to operate on both the buy side and the sell side. Advertisers are increasingly aware of the very concerns that the CMA is raising. Especially, the large brand advertisers and their agencies that today constitute the majority of spend on our platform. As a result, I'm confident we will do well, regardless of Google's moves in programmatic and with DV360, their demand side platform or DSP. In addition to thinking about The Trade Desk and how we gain share, I am often asked to speak about the open internet more broadly. When I put that hat on and speak on behalf of the open Internet. I do get concerned about what Google has done to make it much harder for companies smaller than The Trade Desk to compete in the open Internet. I'm concerned that the press and regulators are too focused on what assets Google owns or should own and instead should apply more scrutiny to Google's behaviors, their incentives, their structure and their tactics. But that's for another day, I believe so long as we execute The Trade Desk is going to do well, regardless of what tactics Google deploys. Even when Google plays unfairly, as some regulators have alleged, it tends to move advertisers and agencies to us. This is one of the reasons we are reporting such a good quarter today and why we're so optimistic about our future. So with that, let's shift gears to discuss our strategy, our tactics, and how we're executing. So let's discuss what's happening inside The Trade Desk. Across the company, we're very clear on our mission and we're extremely focused on helping agencies and advertisers as we always have been. We are focused on the buy side and our goals are clear to be the objective open Internet alternative to walled gardens, to pioneer a new approach to decision TV ad buying, to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet and to create a better open Internet for everyone, including us to enable brands to safely and easily deploy their first party data and to add more value by creating a more efficient supply chain. It's because of these factors that more and more of the world's leading advertisers are embracing our platform compared to our competitors. It's also why you saw a string of key partnership announcements forged in the second quarter, whether it's Disney partnering with us as they race to ensure that the majority of their ad impressions are automated or Amazon's AWS ensuring that the many brands who use their marketing data services can now transact on UID2. The same with Experian who's using UID2 as a common currency, where Albertsons becoming the latest retail media partner on our platform to improve measurement and insight for brands, selling products at Albertsons. And of course, Albertsons has committed to using UID2 to do this. I also want to talk about Netflix recent moves. I believe they are in a very strong position to be a leader in AVOD and hybrid pricing models, similar to how they led the way for more than a decade in SVOD. We have a great relationship with Netflix. We also have a great relationship with Microsoft. We've had many constructive conversation with Netflix over the last few months. I personally am very impressed with how quickly they are diving into advertising. The Netflix partnership with Microsoft is very positive news for the open Internet, the fact that Netflix didn't choose Google is very telling. We believe it's another strong indication that more industry leaders recognize the opportunity of the open Internet compared to the dangers and limitations of walled gardens. By partnering with Microsoft on the supply side of the digital advertising equation, Netflix controls its own destiny. They chose a partner that can represent their interests, not one with a conflict of interest. Xandr is a strong sell side partner and has been a great partner of ours for years. In fact, almost 12 years ago, I initiated the partnership between Microsoft and AppNexus, the company they now own that has been renamed Xandr. Netflix and Xandr have a lot of ground to cover. Once they've done the work on the supply side, driving as much demand as possible toward those ad impressions will come next. Over time, Netflix is very well positioned to open their ad inventory on the demand side to the open Internet. That would enable demand side players to compete in an open, objective and decision market, driving high CPMs and maximizing the value for both the advertiser and the publisher in this case Netflix. They will need to figure out how to do what Disney and their properties like Hulu are doing so well right now, which is creating a personalized TV and ad experience that respects consumer privacy. Disney is setting the pace on this today, which sets a model for what technologically savvy media companies like Netflix and NBCU and Paramount and so many others are likely to pursue very quickly as well. As you know, I predicted publicly and repeatedly many years ago that Netflix and other subscription CTV leaders would eventually offer some kind of ad supported option. The economics of the market demanded. And so many streaming providers have proved how attractive CTV is to advertisers. We work with almost all of them. For example, one of our early CTV partners NBC continues to go from strength to strength on our platform with fully biddable inventory now available across its entire portfolio, including Peacock, which is driving significant interest and growth from our advertisers. The same is true of other premium CTV pioneers, including Discovery+ and HBO Max, which went live recently as well. As a result of our work with the world's leading CTV pioneers, The Trade Desk is now the largest demand source for decision premium CTV advertising. And CTV is now reaching the kind of scale where it is forcing change across the advertising ecosystem. CTV leaders will help forge the future of identity. It's where we will dislodge the bricks of the walled gardens most rapidly. It's where advertisers now have globally scaled premium content alternatives to user generated content. And because CTV has a massive authenticated logged in user base is where advertisers and publishers will innovate new ways to create personalized experiences while also improving consumer privacy and better explaining the quid pro quo of the Internet. There is arguably no company on the planet that cares more about consumer privacy than Disney. They've spent decades building a brand based on intentional, personalized, experience across all of their channels, but as they do that, they also want to ensure that their consumer's privacy is highly protected. As you've seen Disney recently announced and expanded global partnership with The Trade Desk. And as a key part of that partnership, Disney will become interoperable with UID2 across all channels. As you know, Disney engages consumers in many different ways, all of which are incorporated into their audience graph, which is now interoperable with UID2. Aaron LaBerge the President and CTO of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, perhaps set at best and I quote. The growth of our relationship with The Trade Desk is a milestone in addressability and automated buy net scale, and the latest step as we use technology to enable advertisers to buy once to deliver everywhere across Disney. I want to spend a moment on why UID2 is so important. A couple of weeks ago, Google announced that they are delaying the demise of third-party cookies in Chrome until at least the second half of 2024. If you've been paying attention to anything we've said over the last couple of years at The Trade Desk, you'll understand how completely predictable this announcement was. I've said, I'm not sure it is ever in Google's best interest to get rid of third-party cookies, but it ultimately doesn't really matter that much. The uncertainty around Google's decision making is only hardening the resolve of the rest of the industry to develop new approaches to identity. It is shortsighted to think about this work as simply a replacement for cookies that doesn't really capture the scope of what's going on. And Disney is a great example of this. Disney wants to pioneer new ways to create highly personal experiences that protect consumer privacy across all channels. In most of those channels, cookies are not even present. It's much bigger than cookies. CTV does not rely on cookies. Successful consumer-oriented companies are taking a holistic approach to the consumer across all experiences and designing something new. Marketers understand that key marketing objectives such as reach frequency and data usage and privacy can be managed in a much more deliberate and decisioned and holistic manner. Part of the reason that Disney can act with confidence here, is because we've already done the hard work of activating UID2 across the data infrastructure that's something of this central nervous system of digital advertising. AWS is a great illustration of this. AWS recently announced that they will enable their customers to deploy UID2 to help liberate the customer data stored on their platform. And AWS is one of the largest aggregators of marketing data in the world. If an advertiser uses AWS already, they can use UID2 to create an identifier that helps put that data to work without any of the data ever leaving AWS. AWS is just the latest infrastructure leader to deploy UID2. They are joining other leaders that include Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, and Snowflake to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet. The latest major data player to join this movement is Experian. Experian marketing services is one of the leading suppliers of marketing data and insights to advertisers and they are now using UID2 for their third-party data sets. As we've said all along, the success of UID2 will never hinge on ringing 10,000 door bills. First and foremost, it's about gaining traction with the infrastructure of the ad tech industry. And with that infrastructure in place, it is much easier for advertisers and publishers to activate because UID2 is already embedded in the tools they rely on. In a world with better identity solutions like UID2 instead of cookies, publishers will make more money per ad. Advertisers will need pure more relevant ads to make an impact and sell product. Consumers will have more privacy and more control over their privacy. And that's why I'm confident that almost all of our customers will be transacting on UID2 by the end of this year. As I said, at the beginning of my remarks, we are highly encouraged by our performance and optimistic about our ability to outpace the market moving forward. The combination of macro trends and our own innovation enables us to deliver differentiated value to our clients. Of course, we understand many of our customers are dealing with uncertainty, but even with that uncertainty, we remain focused and confident. Programmatic advertising first came of age during the global financial crisis between 2007 and early 2009. We launched The Trade Desk right in the heart of the uncertainty in 2009, while we are not immune to macroeconomic weakness, we gain share coming out of the uncertainty during the early months of the COVID pandemic. And it's because in times of uncertainty and volatility, when marketers have to make the most of every advertising dollar, that we have an opportunity to demonstrate our value. Our customers recognize that efficient and decision advertising can play a critical role in differentiating their brands to specific audiences and specific times. And there's no better platform on which to do that than The Trade Desk. Throughout the first half of 2022, and particularly in the second quarter, I believe we have gained more market share or grabbed more land than at any period in our history. And in large part that's because as marketers become more deliberate with their budgets, they are prioritizing, advertising that delivers the highest return and CTV has moved up the priority list. So, while we can't control the macroeconomic environment, the pace at which we are signing new and expanded customer agreements indicates that we are becoming an indispensable partner in their business growth and we anticipate grabbing land regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We will never rest on our laurels, as one of the few high growth tech companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow we have the financial flexibility to invest so that we can innovate for our customers. Last year on 7/7, we launched our biggest platform upgrade in our company's history. A year later, a 100% of our customers are now using our Solimar platform. With all the data, the measurement and decisioning benefits that Solimar brings them. This is perhaps our greatest engineering achievement yet. Within Solimar, our data marketplace continues to expand rapidly. Many leading retailers are now integrated with our platform, including Walgreens, Albertsons, and Target and we continue to see utilization growth from both endemic and non-endemic advertisers. We continue to innovate to help build the new identity fabric of the Internet, whether it's the data infrastructure work that's already proving so successful in North America or the early work around EUID in Europe, which is already gaining very encouraging traction. We continue to see success from brands working with the Walmart DSP with significant quarter-over-quarter growth and the strongest quarter yet. And in CTV, we are already beta testing our forward market product. We're working with select streaming platforms and advertisers to bring this new approach to CTV decisioning in advance of next year's upfront and early results are very positive. A strong forward market should replace the upfront market and provide a better TV experience for the whole ecosystem. Our early adopter advertisers are seeing excellent win rates and they want to commit larger budgets to it. And publishers are gaining confidence that this should become an essential component of monetizing their inventory. As I said, at the outset, the transformational impact of CTV, the revolutionary approaches to identity and growing instability in some of our walled garden competition will only accelerate our ability to deliver value and to continue to gain share. I could not be more excited about the work ahead of us in the second half of this year and in the years ahead. And with that, I'll pass the baton to Blake, who'll give you more color on the quarter. Thanks, Shyam. Well, so first let me just say, I'm incredibly proud of our Q3, r the start to our Q3 and especially our performance in Q2. But let me just highlight just a couple of the things that have really gone our way in Q2 and given us so much momentum going into Q4 or going into Q3 and Q4. First, we have an amazing secular tailwind of CTV, arguably the best secular tailwind we've ever had. Second, we are of course, seeing the benefits of Solimar, which we've gone to a 100% and it just has all these benefits to our clients. Third, we've got this, this momentum around the joint business plans where we're just getting closer to brands and we're creating better partnerships with each of them. And one of the things that they're excited about is just our relationships in shopper marketing, the overall call, we started with the very biggest retailer in the world in Walmart and we just continued to expand on that. We highlighted some of those included Albertsons during the prepared remarks. But I do want to emphasize that we have never claimed to be a bellwether of the economy or of advertising yet. And what I mean by that is, I think a lot of times people look at our performance and say, how is this so different than everybody else's? And what is often happening is, we are winning because of those secular tailwinds and because programmatic is growing share and because digital is growing share and meanwhile it is possible to have some macroeconomic headwinds in our face and have a secular tailwind of CTV and all the things I just talked about that, that overshadow that. And I think what we are seeing right now is just an amazing trend, which is that, that CTV in particular is extremely competitive. It's also extremely effective. And so, as people are looking for alternatives to walled gardens they are looking to companies like us, who can give them objectivity to buy across all these fragmented places. Many of the smaller walled gardens, I think are especially under pressure. And as I've said, I think CTV can be the thing that brings down the walled gardens. But that'll start with those that are smallest. So, I think often, we're being compared to walled gardens of various sizes, and I don't necessarily think that the fair comparison, and of course, I think we're also in anomaly from the macro. So, hopefully that par is out all those things, but I'm really proud of what we did in Q2 and really optimistic about our Q3. Yes, no problem first. And thanks for the question. So, as I mentioned, CTV is a secular tailwind that it continues to help drive our business. I would even say it continues to lead our business, including our growth. The scale that we're seeing is amazing. And the changes in the world, including the pandemic, which made everybody stay home and stream a lot more, have created changes to the ecosystem that I don't think anybody predicted. And, if you just take a step back and you think about if five years ago, you would've thought that HBO and Netflix would be showing ads I think a lot of people were public about saying that isn't going to happen and it's happening now, so there are these tailwinds that I just can't overstate. And that as a result, CTV is often becoming the place where the very first dollar it is spent. But one of the things, I really like about your question and it gives me a platform to talk about is, okay, well then why isn't everyone in CTV seeing the same sort of growth that you are seeing? And there are a couple reasons for that one. There are some companies that are deployed the walled garden strategy, which is that I have something special either on my operating system or on my channel, and you should buy that exclusively through me. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, no one in CTV has a position that is strong enough to be draconian the same way that you can in other parts of digital like search or social or some of those others. So as a result those tactics, I think are proving more difficult as more and more choices are coming online. So a platform that sits objectively and helps people choose across the 20, 30, 40 places where you can buy, I mean, think of your own habits as a consumer, you were probably watching CTV on two or three apps five years ago. Now you're probably watching them on seven, eight, nine, 10 plus that fragmentation creates a greater need for somebody to centrally partner with all of them measure, reach, and frequency and performance across all of them, and has to have a business model that is eligible to partner with everybody. So that's why I would argue that we have outperformed everybody else is that unique position and that unique strategy that we've deployed as it relates to scatter versus spot and there, I know in this earning season, there has been some discussion about scatter, let me just break it down really simply, scatter is a reference to linear or traditional television where you buy things in upfront, those things that either don't work out as planned or need to be adjusted to you create this middle market, where you're buying traditional television with traditional budgets in not very sophisticated, quickly adapt market. Separately from that is a spot market. And what I would call the spot market is the programmatic market that we operate in. And so when people talk about scatter and spot, especially because when they're talking to people in the financial industry, they can draw analogies to equities. That don't seem that different, but really what we're talking about in television one is very closely associated with the upfront market, which was invented in the 60s. The other one we're talking about digital that brings all of the data and decisioning to bear that, that the internet can really offer that is what makes it so television is going to get better and better, which is there are going to be fewer ads. They are going to be more relevant. There are going to be highly effective. And that funds content at a rate that has never been seen before, that can only be done by a spot market and a forward market, not a legacy upfront market and scatter market. So those are the reasons, why there's a big difference in rhetoric around scatter versus spot. The spot market is amazingly strong, the strongest it has ever been. And that's because of the variety of apps that are coming into the ecosystem and the need for ad funded content because all of them need ad dollars in order to continue to fund their content making machines. Thanks, Vasily. Awesome. Thanks. I'll go first and I'll let Blake go and just to order you asked the question. So let me first just reiterate our strategy in UID2. So first, we created UID2. We open sourced it, we gave it to the ecosystem. This is not ours, but it is something that we really want to see successful because we think there needs to be a privacy safe currency that makes it possible for personalization to take place at large scale. That needs to replace cookies, but it also needs to do way more than that. And when people reduce it down to a discussion about replacing cookies, it doesn't really capture what it's about. It is a currency of the Internet that makes personalization and privacy control way better than it exists today. The way that you win that way, the way that you fix the infrastructure of the Internet, which can be massively upgraded, especially so that consumers have more control over privacy is that you partner with the infrastructure. Many might mistakenly think the way that you change the infrastructure of the Internet as you partner with millions of publishers or millions of apps or hundreds of content creators in television. And instead, it's to start with the infrastructure. So the deal with Disney wouldn't have easily been done if we hadn't already partnered with Salesforce or Snowflake or a Adobe or AWS, some of those infrastructure plays that make it possible. But because we had it made it easy for us to then have great conversations with Disney. Additionally, Disney has done an amazing job of assembling all of its different assets, including Hulu, which was one of the first Connected TV plays to really understand the benefit of highly relevant ads and high CPMs that come from relevance. And that you of course have to have a strategy around identity and personalization in order to get those high CPMs and in order to get that benefit. So I think one of the things that Disney has really led the way on is making certain that all the way at the top of their technical organization, they have a clear understanding of what it takes to provide personalization and consumer privacy protection and control at the same time. And while doing that, I think that they have made it possible to better monetize Hulu, ESPN, ABC, Disney+, FX, and so many other things that they own. Because they own so many of those and because I think they understand that relationship at the highest levels of the organization, I think this partnership is really significant, because number one, I think Disney has a clear strategy going forward that some others don't. And two, I think we've established ourselves as a great partner of theirs, and we continue to provide them with an amazing amount of demand and high CPMs that is going to fuel their business and better content. Because they represent such a significant amount of the inventory, and especially because almost everything in CTV is logged in, this represents a massive step forward for UID for an authenticated Internet for a better internet. And when you look at extended runway for cookies going away, as well as just the need for CTV to get a better at monetizing. This represents a move forward for everyone. So I do think Disney is proving itself to be a leader once again. So it's hard to overstate the significance of the partnership. Blake? Thanks, James. You bet. Thanks, Youssef for the question. I actually was hoping somebody would ask about Netflix and Microsoft, because I think it's one of the most exciting scenes that's happened in our space in it in the quarter. So let me first just restate something that, that Netflix stated on their earnings call, which I think is a direct quote, it's still early days. So Netflix has been like learning about the advertising business or in the advertising business for only a few months as they're \u2013 have established a very important, but early partnership. But I \u2013 for one was very excited when I learned that they had selected Microsoft for a number of reasons, as many of you know, I worked at Microsoft before I sold the first ad exchange to Microsoft. I in fact introduced the President of the ads division to \u2013 at the time, the CEO of AppNexus, which later became Xandr. So it's been a part of my personal journey, as well as the fact that I've just been very close to AppNexus and Xandr, of course, Xandr now being owned by Microsoft. Xandr, as you point out Youssef, it has a small DSP, but it is primarily an SSP. They primarily focus on the sell side. If you look at the \u2013 if you were to stack rank the major players of demand for CTV, I think you'd find that we are the largest and somewhere around number 10 near the bottom of the top 10 list would be Xandr in terms of size. I would estimate that they provide less than 10% of the demand to other independent inventory or content companies. So as a result, what I think that means for us and for the open Internet is that the role that Microsoft is going to play for Netflix is one where they are helping them get started. They're helping them create a clear identity strategy. I think they very clearly are going to have to have a strategy both for identity, as well as for monetization that involves the open Internet. Because this is early days, it's less important to me about the role the Trade Desk plays with Netflix in the crawl phase than it does in the walk and the run phase. And to me, selecting Microsoft makes it, so it's nearly inevitable that Netflix will be a part of the open Internet and that they'll welcome demand from lots of different places. And that will be the only way that they can maximize their inventory and get the highest CPMs possible, as somebody who wants to see Netflix do well and has a strong relationship with Netflix leadership. I think this is a solid plan. It's a great start. There's a lot of work ahead of them, but I think that we are extremely likely to have a great partnership with them over the long-term, but there's a lot of stuff that has to be done in order for Netflix to be the leader in AVOD that they've been in SVOD. So \u2013 but I'm looking forward to it. Thank you, Youssef. Thanks for the questions, Tim. So maybe aside from CTV, my favorite topic to talk about is actually forward market. And I especially love to talk about it in the context of investors, just because you live the concept every single day, even though, it's somewhat more into advertising. So first of all, the upfront this process where you commit to buy ads on television was a process that was created in the early 60s. In fact, we've sort of jokingly made comparison, maybe half jokingly made comparison to the fact that the audio cassette was invented the same year that the TV upfronts were and audio cassettes obviously have evolved, we don't use them anymore in our daily lives, but the upfront hasn't changed much and the process is exactly the same. You have a party or an event, where you commit dollars to advertising for the better part of the year with the absence of data and transactions like it's just \u2013 in a way it's even strange that as an industry it's still happens that way. I mean, if we had a forward market for tulips, that was exactly the same as it was 400 years ago. We would look for ways to evolve. We would do something different. So the forward market that we're developing with our partners is much more like a commodities market, where you have forward contracts, you use data and forecasting to get the benefits of commitment. And the thing that is really amazing about TV ads in particular is that publishers are willing to take less money if you'll commit to buy it in advance. And advertisers are willing to pay more money, if they can have the assurance that they're going to get it. I mean, imagine, you wouldn't spend $3 million, $4 million or $5 million to make a Super Bowl ad, if you didn't know it was going to run during the Super Bowl. So commitments can be a really important part of television. And so as we move to CTVs, there's no reason to create a rudimentary 1960s version of a forward market. We should create one that leverages all the very best parts of programmatic takes all the learnings of commodities markets and utilizes that very \u2013 the very best things about programmatic. So we've developed that its early days, but we have a good commitment from both buyers and sellers to make it possible to create a much better and stronger market. The only way that that works is if you have good forecasting and the only way that that works is if you have a common currency like UID2. So two \u2013 the second part of your question, does UID2 play a significant role in that? Absolutely. Because in order for us to give a common understanding to buyers to sellers, it's one thing to buy in the spot market where you're buying an ad for less than a penny in almost every case. It's another thing to commit hundreds of millions of dollars in advance to buying ads. You need a greater degree of assurance. You need greater transparency. You need visibility that can only come from forecasts where you have a common understanding, common currencies become very important in order to have any market other than a spot market, unless you're operating in discounts and constantly working on make goods, which is exactly what the upfront and scatter markets do in traditional television. Thanks, Tim. Yes. So I'm glad you've asked about just these other growth drivers and of course, how does UID affect it and especially just how does the deprecation of cookies affect UID and international expansion and shopper marketing? So I'm not certain that we made this as clear as we could've in the prepared remarks. Cookies and ads that are bought inside a browser, because cookies are only relevant inside of a browser at least directly relevant inside of a browser, represents a small percentage of our business. Display is a small percentage of our business. It's \u2013 as a percentage, it's shrinking, even though, we've seen growth, because growth in other areas are growing faster. It's still continues to shrink. So it's a small slice of the pie. What are much bigger are things like mobile, which don't rely on cookies or CTV, which don't rely on cookies. They have other ways of creating identity. That, of course, in CTV, nearly everything you do is on the other side of a login, meaning you log into Netflix or you log to Amazon or you log into Peacock or Paramount or Hulu before you view content. And that makes it very prone to be interoperable with something like UID2. So there's no cookie problem to solve in TV, but everybody in TV needs more subscribers, and I believe everybody in TV needs to offer an AVOD solution for those subscribers that would rather pay with their time than with money. And especially when you have to keep providing or making rate hikes in order to pay for incremental content. So the cookie changes don't slow down UID at all. And in fact, I've always said that the biggest threat to the walled gardens is the competitive nature of Connected Television. That's especially true in identity and the competitive nature of television is really what I think will fuel UID forward faster than anything that happens with cookies delay or not. But the same thing is true internationally. I mean, especially if you look at the places where GDP growth is predicted to be the highest in the world, those are places that are often mobile first, so they're less reliant on cookies as well, so especially in Asia. So business models that have a holistic approach to identity and can customize ads to think holistically are the ones that are going to do the best, especially for the biggest companies in the world, which is why I think we're really in a strong position for international growth. And thirdly, as it relates to international, I think it's fair to say, there's more likely to be economic headwinds outside the United States than inside the United States. It given that we look at this as land grab time. So there is a big opportunity for us to expand our market share. Even if there are economic headwinds internationally, that we just want to continue to invest in, especially because outside of big competitors like the Google's of the world where their DSP is not their primary focus for those smaller competitors where being a DSP is their primary focus. They're often much smaller and can't afford to make those investments. So there's a big opportunity for us to expand around the world. And then in shopper marketing, it \u2013 there is this incredible desire, especially inside of CPGs, and CPGs for a whole bunch of reasons, including inflation are under pressure to do more with less. And what can really help them is to see end-to-end. If I show an ad to this person, how did it affect whether they buy it, add a store to see end-to-end, the impact of their spend is extremely valuable to them. And retailers know that that is a way for them to spin their flywheels faster. Initially they looked at it as a way to make more money on selling data, but now they look at it as a way to spin their flywheels faster. And so I think it's one of the surest ways that we will spin our own flywheel is to continue to enable an open internet where there's lots of competition and where marketers that sell goods inside of stores, brick-and-mortar stores continue to get the data driven benefits that historically have been reserved for online retailers like Amazon. So, where everybody is looking at competing with Amazon, they know they have to be focused on becoming as data driven or more than they are. And we're just seeing amazing strides in retail that, that contributes to our shopper marketing strategy. So, we've just seen our TAM expand in the short term, just because of this focus of moving to fixing this sort of end-to-end challenge. And I do think it is true that the discussion about the demise of cookies has made that faster, even though it's a totally different aspect of measurement, but it is improved and accelerated the move to better measurement, which I don't know that there's any place that's better off in those places where we're doing end-to-end measurement and shopper marketing, And then John, we can squeeze in one more. You bet. So, I think at initially what you're going to want to see is control from both publishers or content owners and advertisers in terms of who shows up? Who has access to it? But I do think that in the long term, and we're talking years from now, one way that you can get buyers to sign up is if they buy too much, they can sell it to somebody else. And so I do think it's possible to see a derivatives market exist sort of on top of that forward market, so that you can essentially transact in the rights to buy those so that you can secure inventory. But making them fungible makes it, or resellable, or both rather, as I think a really important part of the market in the long term. So, I do think that that component will exist in the long-term, but the most important thing in the short term is to take advantage of the fact that you can bring data to bear that publishers want guarantees and all the benefits of programmatic advertisers would like to reserve inventory and have all the benefits of programmatic, which includes the ability for them to bring their data into the equation. In traditional television, as well as in the scatter market, advertisers can't really bring their own data to the table. So, the forward market would enable them to do that, which would help prices go up and is really going to benefit, both the buyer and the seller. I think there's going to be a lot of rules that exist for years to prevent the resale of that. But I do think long-term the economic incentives are there for that to exist. It creates an amazing market. And I don't think that there's any company that's better positioned to benefit from this market than The Trade Desk, because of the role that we play by looking at everything by looking at nearly all inventory, because we don't own it. We make it possible to partner with all of it. And I think we can easily become once again, the world leader in providing demand, not just in the spot market, which we already are today, but also in the forward market, which is why we're working so hard to create it, and leverage the relationships that we've been tending to for more than a decade now."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon everyone. As you have seen in our results, Q2 was a very strong quarter. Revenue was $377 million representing an increase of 35% year-over-year. Our top-line growth of 35% is especially impressive, given we are comparing against a prior year growth rate of over 100% in Q2 of 2021. While the macro environment has created some uncertainty and we are not immune to it, we continue to gain share as more and more advertisers seek efficiency and measurable results in their ad spent, particularly in CTV. We also benefit from the diversity of our business model, including not only the breadth of advertisers and verticals we represent, but also the range of inventory we have access to across the open internet, which provides a long-term durability we are proud of. During the quarter, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is shifting increasingly towards data driven buying and measurable results. Growth was broad-based across channels and verticals this quarter. We saw continued strength from CTV, which again led our growth from a scaled channel perspective. We've successfully completed a full transition to Solimar and our customers continue to see positive results as they utilize our platform to sharpen campaign goals, activate our industry-leading AI and leverage more data elements per impression. We are also seeing progress in our shopper marketing business. We have brought new partners into the platform over the past few months, and we are pleased to see increasing interest and adoption from advertisers utilizing shopper data in their campaigns. Although, it is still very early days for us spend that utilizes our expanding shopper data lineup continues to ramp very well. With the continued strong top-line performance in Q2, we generated $139 million in adjusted EBITDA, or about 37% of revenue. When we outperform on the top-line, we often see that outperformance drop down to EBITDA, as it did again, in Q2. I'm proud of our sustained efforts to consistently generate meaningfully positive EBITDA while continuing to invest in the critical areas of our business that can drive our future growth. This was particularly true in Q2 as items such as our first live companywide event and over three years, resumed and travel also continued to ramp up. From a channel perspective, CTV via a wide margin, let our growth again during the quarter. Exiting Q2 video, which includes CTV represented a low-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter, and display and audio continued to represent about 15% and 5% of our business respectively. Geographically, North America represented about 90% of spend and international represented about 10% of spend. Spend in North America maintained its resiliency, as we continue to win new business and gain share. In particular, our Chicago office, which is our second largest office behind New York, grew spend faster on a year-over-year basis than any other office in the world that represents at least 1% of our spend, fantastic results by that team as we continue to expand our reach. Our international spend grew both sequentially and year-over-year, but dropped slightly as a percent of overall mix. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America, as was the case again in Q2. However, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, CTV spend in Europe, again more than doubled year-over-year. Despite a challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe, we are focused on making the long-term investment so will position us to be stronger when conditions improve. As we have proven in the past, as our customers become more deliberate and data driven with their ad spend much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help customers achieve better ROI and win more of their budget. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend nearly all of them groom the double digits during the quarter, both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Food and drink and technology were also very strong with food and drink accelerating on a year-over-year basis every month during the quarter. Home and garden and automotive grew slower than the average however, both verticals grew faster than the average in July. Additionally automotive still grew the double-digits in Q2 and accelerated in growth from Q1. We continue to believe that there is the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses, Q2 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation were $250 million up 45% year-over-year. Growth and operating expenses is influenced by investments in our team, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development. As we continue to build the platform for long-term growth, as well as the return of in-person events. Income tax was $21 million for the second quarter. The higher amount of tax relative to prior quarters was driven primarily by lower benefits from stock based awards, the timing of which are variable. Adjusted net income was $99 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $92 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $86 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days up nine days from a year ago. DPOs were 73 days up six days from a year ago. We exited Q2 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments ended the quarter at $1.2 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $385 million, which would represent growth of 28% on a year-over-year basis. In Q3, we anticipate U.S. political midterm election spend to represent a low single-digit share as a percent of our business. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $140 million in Q3. While there's continued uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment, we continue to feel confident in our ability to execute and take share. Given the large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities to invest in our business. In more uncertain times, this enables us to widen the distance between ourselves and our competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the quarter with significant growth drivers, including CTV, retail media, our international business, Solimar as well as the U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about our future prospects. We continue to generate strong annual free cash flow and the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well as we enter the second half of the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that operator, let's open up the call for questions. Thanks, Shyam. Yes, sure. James, regarding your question on the hiring, I just would take just a real quick moment to step back a little bit. If we think about where we are in our business, we have \u2013 we're in one of the greatest situations I think a company could ask for, right. We've got high top line growth, high EBITDA growth with strong margins and we also generate solid consistent annual free cash flow. And so having those three things operating together for me, it's got super special meaning as you can imagine. And what it does is it gives us the opportunity and the ability to be deliberate with our choices. And in doing so, I'm also proud of our ability to stay disciplined with those investments, regardless of the operating environment that we're in. You mentioned what other companies are doing. And based on what we're hearing, well, there are many of our peers that might have more resources, that are pausing, hiring or cutting investments because they invested too aggressively. We didn't get ahead of ourselves the last couple years like I \u2013 it sounds like many companies did. And I think that's really paid off for us. It's given us the ability to stay the course and be deliberate about our investments, and including hiring, which is one of the largest ones that we will entertain. And so like we mentioned earlier this year, we expect to increase the pace of our investments as we focus on the long-term growth of the business, but we're always going to stay mindful of long-term productivity supported by our business model. So with regards to hiring and how it affects expenses and such, our Q2 EBITDA was super strong and that included our first full company in-person event that we had in over three years. Our Q3 forecast reflects that investment thesis that we can continue to generate strong EBITDA and invest for the long-term. And we're focused in hiring in areas that fuel our growth, whether that's engineering or business development or account management roles. And so I'm comfortable with the trajectory that we're on and where things stand. And I really think that we can pursue those investments in an operating expense structure that we believe is actually better than pre-pandemic. So I really like the position we're in to drive more efficiency, more EBITDA and free cash flow, but also as we scale. And so I'm really excited about our situation there. And then with regards to your question on Solimar is a high. I'm really excited about the traction that we've seen that I think the product really separates us from the competition and we did reach a 100% usage. I think that it took us about a year to get there. I think the last major product update check like 50% longer in the amount of time it took. So it's a real Testament to the team and the value that I think we're providing the customers that are doing that upgrade. And so on a usage basis, the trends look good like average data elements used per impression, it's more than doubled for the same customers on our previous platform. Average channel usage has increased over 50%. And then the AI, machine learning element that we have the adoption on that on Solimar, I think it increased around 50% versus the prior platform. And this is all about getting customers a better ROI. If we can do that, they're going to return again for future campaigns and we think it \u2013 what that does is it spins the flywheel for everybody for us included. And so just really excited about the momentum here and really proud actually what the team was able to deliver. And then to follow up sort to on your other questions, I think, on the shopper marketing component, we don't break out that level of detail in our shopper marketing business. The only thing I could just say is that, we are seeing the spend ramp, it ramped into Q2 is more large brands, test our testing and adopting it and we expect that to continue. I think just the selection opportunity that our customers are going, are now having is going to be a flywheel spin for them that I debate in my head, whether they're going to be able to get it very many other places, if any. And so I think that's just such a long-term opportunity for us like Jeff said, I'm just; I'm super excited about it. And then with regards to your question on political, in the midterms, the spend will occur much closer to Election Day than we might find in a presidential year, like we expect to see that start ramping here over the late summer. I would say through November, there's so many races out there that are going to be competitive, and we'll just have to see how competitive, whether it's the House the Senate, governor campaigns or whatnot. I think that our overall expectation, and is that the in Q3, we expected to be a low single-digit percentage spend in Q3. And that was in our prepared remarks as well. But overall just with regards to political, what I would say is, our goal is to it's to run a better process, it's to earn trust with our customers. We've been building this business over quite a few years. We've got really high retention rates with our customers. We do believe, we're the go to platform for digital advertising now versus maybe other social media platforms. And so we do expect some tailwinds. That's why we called it out in the guidance, but we'll have to see how this all unfolds into the back half of the year. Thanks, Brian."

[Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chris Toth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\nChris Toth : Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties.  In particular, our expectations around the impact of the recent pandemic on our business and results of operations in addition to potential supply chain disruptions or other macro events that could disrupt advertising spend are all subject to change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to our risk factors referenced in our press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green : Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we are off to a great start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 43% compared with last year, our fastest first quarter growth rate in the last 4 years. Our strong growth is a testament to a variety of factors that I want to touch on today and which give us significant optimism for the future. Our performance is especially encouraging because annual advertising budgets are often being reset and reconsidered in Q1, making them historically harder to predict. And this year, the macro environment was challenging with the ongoing global pandemic, war in the Ukraine and the higher rates of inflation around the world. Despite those challenges, we again exceeded our own expectations. I believe we are now firmly established as the default DSP for the open Internet and that we are very well positioned to grow and grab share regardless of the macro environment. We now have over 1,000 customers, representing tens of thousands of advertisers spending on our platform across the open Internet. We continue to see a steady stream of new agencies and brands starting to work with us for the first time as well as existing customers increasing their spend with us. We are seeing strong momentum around key initiatives such as Connected TV, Shopper Data, UID2, OpenPath and our game-changing new data marketplace. In each case, we are working with our advertising clients to drive maximum value from their campaign dollars. And this, in turn, helps us grow our trusted relationships with the world's leading brands and agencies, many of whom are signing long-term strategic partnerships with us. As a CEO, it's always important for me to look at how we are performing relative to the industry. For example, the IAB and PwC predict digital advertising will increase approximately 8% in 2022. Publicis Group's Zenith estimates the increase at about 14%. But either way, we continue to grow at a pace well ahead of industry estimates, which means we are gaining share and adding significant value. I continue to be extremely optimistic in part because of the combination of our exceptional 95% plus retention rate and our significant growth rate. There are macroeconomic forces, which have changed the media and technology landscape dramatically in the last few months, especially in CTV, which also gives me optimism. As many of you know, I have spent many of the last 10 years publicly predicting that Netflix and nearly everyone else would eventually show out. Netflix recently announced that they are likely to make ads a part of their future. This and so many other great things are happening in CTV. In fact, I can't think of a time that the TV landscape has had more positive changes in a short period of time than what has happened in Q1 of this year. I want to spend the biggest lot of time on that. But in order to discuss the significance of what's happening in CTV, we first need to discuss what's happening with 2 foundational initiatives: first, our work on a new identity framework for the Internet; and second, our work to make the supply chain more efficient. So first, identity. The Internet has been operating on a quid pro quo since it became commercial, but the Internet has been a suboptimal Internet. And by that, I mean we've used cookies as a make-shift technology to enable relevant advertising. But due to a series of events and choices, cookies are going away. Currently, Google has the majority of the browser market share around the entire Internet outside of China. So they decided when this transition is going to take place, and they currently targeted the end of Q1 2023. This has created a very unique community to upgrade the Internet. Indeed, without those many circumstances, this opportunity wouldn't exist. We are upgrading from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. The open Internet is scrambling to coordinate and collectively upgrade. Many different opt-in IDs are being created. Some of them will scale and survive, some won't. However, those that scale will be distributed, encrypted and interoperable. We don't believe IDs can or will scale if they don't upgrade the experience for consumers. With this in mind, we developed and launched UID2. This is the second version of UID, version 2 being e-mail and phone number-based instead of cookie-based. This allows consumers to take their privacy settings and controls with them all over the Internet without loss of control or a false sense of security. Some of the privacy protection that has been promised to consumers by large technology companies with billions of log-ins have misled some consumers to believe that they control privacy, opt-in and the quid pro quo of the Internet across CTVs, mobile environments and computer browsers. UID actually does enable consumers to set preferences and restrictions for each Web publisher, mobile app and CTV app. They choose who they trust and can change their mind. Their preferences are tied to an encrypted, hashed, salted ID based on e-mail address or phone number that a consumer can take with them. Because this move to an upgraded opt-in Internet is scheduled to happen in about 10 months based on the date Google deprecates third-party cookies in Chrome, the entire open Internet ecosystem is thinking about identity, and we continue to make significant progress with UID2. And I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about this progress and the various innovations that are driving that progress. In terms of the number of unique IDs, we are now measuring UIDs on billions of devices. With every passing month, we are posting new all-time highs. That comes as more advertisers activate on UID2 and as more publishers adopt it. Let me give you one quick example, which is particularly illustrative of the business value of UID2. MediaVine is a company that manages advertising for more than 8,500 independent publishers. Those include some large publishers like the Hollywood Gossip and some very niche publishers like Steamy Kitchen. They're big. They are a comScore top 5 lifestyle media platform with more than 130 million monthly viewers and 17 billion monthly ad impressions.  MediaVine has now adopted and deployed UID2. Their publishers have seen CPMs increase more than 100%. With UID2, they can create privacy safe identifiers for their readers, pass those on safely to advertisers who can then serve relevant advertising without ever knowing anything directly identifiable about the reader. Better opt-ins and more sign-ins, including new lightweight SSOs, is what a post-cookie Internet is going to look like. And pioneering advertisers, publishers and CTV providers are building that Internet now. Momentum is amazing, but we're still in the early stages, simply because the Internet is so big. This work is both inevitable and essential. Without relevant advertising, CPMs will [crater]. That's the fundamental value exchange of the Internet, relevant advertising in exchange for free content. That's why so many publishers are implementing UID2 with many already reporting strong CPM growth. The ecosystem of UID partners also continues to expand. InfoSum, a leading data collaboration platform, recently signed up as another closed operator of UID2. Many leading advertisers and their agencies, including Omnicom, already use InfoSum to activate their first-party data and are excited about this partnership as they look to unlock the value of that data while maintaining control over it using UID2. AppLovin also recently joined the UID ecosystem. AppLovin is one of the world's leading mobile in-app ad exchanges, and our advertisers now have access to ad opportunities across more than 140,000 apps and 1.8 billion devices with the precision and relevance that UID2 creates. The solutions such as UID2 allow us to manage that value exchange in a way that improves the experience for all parties. I believe this new approach will ultimately result in an upgrade to the Internet. We also recently announced that we are launching a version of UID2 that will be tailored for the European market called EUID. To understand the connection between UID2 and EUID, consider an analogy to Chrome and Chromium. Chromium is a free open-source development platform for Web browsers. Many browsers use core elements of Chromium, including Google Chrome, which uses Chromium as a foundation, but which is enhanced and adapted by Google. Essentially Chrome is one iteration built on top of Chromium. In the same way, UID2 is an open-source project and EUID is a version of it, developed for Europe that meets the specific needs of that market, especially the legislative requirements. Building this specific version also allows us to build in the features that give our partners reassurance that data will not leave Europe, even for international companies that do business and have data in Europe. With this approach, we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant identity solution in the market today. In order for the open Internet to thrive, it will require more authentication or logging in. High CPMs and relevance will gravitate to publishers and content owners who have logged in users. CTV and new sites and apps especially have a unique opportunity at this moment as the identity foundation of the Internet being rebuilt. The CTV leaders understand this. Nearly every CTV ad is shown on the authenticated side of a log-in, almost always via an e-mail or phone number, which means CTV already operates in an opt-in environment unlike much of the rest of the Internet, which is still an opt-out, although it's transitioning. Within that environment, broadcasters can work with advertisers to build the new identity fabric of the Internet that provides addressability while significantly upgrading consumer privacy. And new identity solutions, including UID2, are key here. With UID2, advertisers can safely onboard first-party data. And then with interoperability with CTV apps, they can find valuable audiences, both current and prospects, exactly when they are viewing their favorite premium content.  Ultimately, this is a much better advertising experience than one based on cookies. Cookies were never really intended to do this work. They were just co-opted. But in new technology environments like CTV we can build a new identity framework that allows advertisers to create relevance, enables publishers to maximize yield and hand consumers much more control over their privacy. So in many ways, the CTV ecosystem will pioneer the future of identity. To be clear, it's not about any one identity solution. It's about interoperability. This new fabric will include new currencies such as UID2, but also other identifiers, whether it's those developed by CTV providers themselves, measurement, partners like Nielsen or by companies such as LiveRamp. And we are working with all of them to ensure this new fabric pays off those promises I just outlined for all participants. There is so much to discuss today that I'm going to bookmark a related issue that I'd like to discuss in a future call, our data marketplace. The data marketplace is as healthy as ever, largely because UID2 and a better opt-in environment creates a better foundation for our data marketplace, which has the potential to become the largest in the world. I don't think any walled garden can ever create a data marketplace to rival it. Already, we have enacted massive marketplace design upgrades. As a result, we're already seeing higher data usage, better CPAs and ROI for advertisers, better margins and a faster spinning flywheel for us. We have once again stair-step increased the consumer surplus of our offering to our clients. There is so much more to report on this and more change and benefit to come, so I'm excited to talk about that in the future. Related to all the progress we're making with UID is the recent launch of OpenPath. We announced it in our last earnings report, and I'd like to give an update today. First, a reminder of what it is. OpenPath is a way for our advertisers to plug directly into publisher inventory via our platform. By plugging in directly, publishers have the opportunity to capture the value of an opt-in Internet and implement changes that benefit all participants, including advertisers and agencies. I do want to reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSB or supply side business. OpenPath is simply a direct path to inventory with publishers that already have their own yield management solutions. OpenPath helps eliminate steps in the process where there may be fees or charges with no value in return. For example, since we announced OpenPath, we have shut down Google's open bidding on our platform. When we announced OpenPath a few months ago, we also had commitments from news organizations that represent a majority of news consumers in the United States, organizations such as Reuters, the Washington Post, Gannett, Conde Nast, which owns Vanity Fair, Vogue, The New Yorker and many others, McClatchy, which owns more than 30 leading daily newspapers, including The Kansas City Star and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Hearst Magazines and Newspapers, which operate major titles such as the Cosmopolitan and the San Francisco Chronicle, the Tribune Group and several others. In the days following the announcement, we had more than 100 inbound inquiries from major publishers looking to join the initiative. We're prioritizing journalism as we launch OpenPath because nowhere is the danger of the absence of identity more apparent. Recently, we announced more journalistic publishers committing to OpenPath, including the L.A. Times, BuzzFeed, Forbes, MediaVine and Red Ventures, which includes publications such as CNET and Lonely Planet. As more publishers adopt OpenPath, they will make UID2 deployment or interoperability a key element of their plan. In doing so, they can activate their own first-party subscriber data in a way that protects that data but also provides enough relevance to advertisers that we can enhance the value of those ad impressions and yield for publishers. For those that don't show most of their ads after a user has logged in, OpenPath will include a simple UID2-based SSO that will help them make this essential transition to a post-cookie environment. Let me bring this back to CTV because CTV is really the epicenter of open Internet identity. We've seen massive moves in the CTV landscape recently. In 2021, we added exponentially more inventory, thanks to new partnerships with a wide range of partners, including Peacock, Paramount Plus, Discovery Plus and Sky. Early this year, we entered a scaled relationship with HBO Max, one of the most recent and fastest-growing content companies to aggressively adopt ad-funded subscriptions for consumers. On a more macro level, Amazon bought MGM and streams ads through IMDB TV. Just this year so far, Disney+ announced that ads would be added as a choice to their app. Microsoft acquired Xandr. Time Warner left the AT&T family and is now owned by Discovery and is mostly led by Discovery Plus leadership, which is one of the most savvy programmatic teams in TV. And of course, Netflix recently announced that it will likely make ads available on their platform. These major changes in the landscape have huge implications for the future of CTV and programmatic. A tailored TV ad is probably the most effective scaled advertising available today on or off-line. As a result, for most of our clients, TV is the largest segment of their campaign spend. That unique combination of video and audio delivered at a time when the audience is leaned in, remains the most effective way to touch the hearts and minds of consumers. As those consumers have shifted in mass to streaming platforms, advertisers are following them. For consumers, on-demand content is just better. As content owners and the streaming apps are competing for more subscribers, it has become very clear, providing consumers with choice is the only way to win. This is a great setup for Netflix. By not having ads to date, Netflix has protected an amazing user experience, but it required Netflix to keep raising prices so that they could keep making and buying content. At some point, price becomes an issue for nearly all consumers. Consider what we can learn from TV of the past. Even in the days of cable bundles, very few consumers pay for every premium channel, Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, NBA League Pass, et cetera.  In the past, nearly all channels have had ads. Now once again, consumers will have something better, choice. Netflix will very likely set up a clean option for consumers, see ads and pay meaningfully less or pay slightly more and avoid ads altogether. Consumers will continue to be given more choices. I predict that with this move, Netflix will continue to be something of a pace car in TV innovation. They were the first ones to really nail the subscription model for CTV. They were the first to 100 million global subscribers, the first to 200 million, and they continue to lead that race today. And now they are embracing consumer choice as a way to expand their market share even further. It's important to note that at least half of Netflix subscribers are outside the United States. So the implications to this move has global ramifications to the world of CTV. But there will even be more to this part of the story. As Netflix explores advertising options, they will be unburdened by legacy processes that some of their competitors are working through. For example, they will be able to structure their advertising operations so they don't have sales channel conflict. They can be data-driven from the start in everything that they do, using data to ensure that they maximize yield on every ad impression. In all of these dimensions, and likely many others, I believe Netflix will continue to innovate and set the pace. And as with any market, others will have to adapt accordingly. Many of them already are. We are working on these opportunities with leading CTV providers every single day. HBO Max, Disney+ and Netflix are all public about their intentions to implement ad experiences. This adds pressure to all content owners to accelerate the move to data-driven buying and selling and finding ways to make the most competitive consumer experience, which means limited relevant ads with high CPMs. For CTV to continue to produce the amazing and expensive content that is driving this new golden age of television, relevant ads are the only way to fund and preserve it. This requires CTV to participate in the open Internet because in walled gardens, one cannot control universal reach and frequency. Additionally, I believe this means every CTV company around the world is racing to create this optimal viewing experience. CTV has historically competed regionally due to the licensing and broadcast regulations. Netflix and YouTube have made this a global race. We're seeing content owners all over the world quickly adapting to these recent moves. Recently, I've personally spoken about this directly with some of our content partners in the United States and in Europe. They are already feeling the pressure to move fast and to improve their ad experiences. This messaging from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max is requiring everyone to embrace biddable environments and move away from legacy models like upfronts and even programmatic guarantees where advertiser choice is limited. These changes in the TV landscape also have adjusted marketers' mindsets. As advertisers are seeing reach and impact erode from traditional cable television, they are focused on moving to premium streaming content. Increasingly, this is the most important buy on the media plan. Marketers want to advertise against premium content as much as possible. It's content they can trust. It's content that reflects their own brand. It's content they can activate on and measure against with precision. As advertisers prioritize ads on premium content on our platform, they are beginning to start their campaign planning there, too. As a result, user-generated content is increasingly getting the leftovers. With the explosive growth of premium CTV over the last few years, especially the last year, the trend is clear. We see it clearly reflected in some of the UGC data that's been reported out in the last few weeks, and it's also why CTV remains by far our fastest-growing channel and why premium video in all of its forms has become the largest segment of our business. This trend will be equally apparent internationally where there is also a flight to premium content. We work with many of the Fortune 500 companies, almost all of whom direct their advertising campaigns at multiple international markets. As more premium supply comes online, particularly premium video, we have more than enough demand to satisfy it. And we could not be more excited about what this shift from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max means in terms of opening the door of AVOD supply. Not only in major markets that have already embraced CTV advertising such as Western Europe and Australia, but also in many other markets where AVOD will be a vital driver of subscription growth because of tighter economic pressure on consumer wallets. Premium video, where everything is authenticated, is one of those key areas where the future of Internet identity is being forged, not just for CTV, but across the open Internet, including inside the browser. That may not seem obvious as cookies are not present in CTV. And so you'd think they'd be less affected by the potential phaseout of cookies next year. But CTV needs persistent identity to have effective and high CPM ads, and they need high CPM ads to fund that content. It's economics that's driving that process. As more CTV leaders embrace advertising, they want to ensure that they create as much addressability as possible because that's the only way that they can maintain high CPMs. An advertiser will pay, say, a $12 CPM if they know the viewers are watching the latest hot reality show, but they will pay 3x that if there's a reasonable chance those viewers are interested in their product. And that's why they will be among the pioneers of the new identity framework or the open Internet. I'd like to wrap this up by bringing us back to the market opportunity in front of us. The global advertising industry is moving rapidly towards a $1 trillion TAM. As the market grows, the majority of that spend will be digital, and all of it will ultimately be traded programmatically. At the same time, the industry is making important progress in several dimensions in building the Internet advertising ecosystem of the future, one that no longer relies on cookies. The Internet is getting an upgrade. We're moving from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. Everything is founded on a better identity framework. On that foundation comes better controls for consumers, more choices for consumers on how to pay for CTV subscriptions, whether that's with money or with ad time, and better measurement and data. As the ecosystem continues to evolve and move away from walled gardens led by CTV, we will unleash the power of programmatic for our advertisers and for our publisher partners. It will be an improved experience for everyone, consumers included. The innovations we are driving to help accomplish this are already delivering performance improvements for us today. They are a key factor in why we are off to such a positive start in 2022 and why we are so optimistic about our growth opportunities looking forward. As I said earlier, advertisers are increasingly gravitating to our platform as the de facto DSP of the open Internet led by CTV. And we will continue to innovate to reinforce that leadership position and deliver more value to our advertisers. Our profitable business model allows us complete flexibility to make these investments and continue to drive growth. In doing so, we will help build a better Internet for all stakeholders, and all of that is what makes me so excited about our growth prospects. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will take you through more of the financial details.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, 2022 started out strong with solid Q1 financial performance and execution despite the current macro environment. Q1 revenue was $315 million, a 43% increase and an acceleration in growth from a year ago. In Q1, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is leaning increasingly towards data-driven advertising and measurable results. This was evidenced by the continued strength in CTV, which again led our growth from a scale channel perspective. Solimar adoption is over 80%, and we continue to see promising results as customers are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously. More data-driven precision improves ROI for customers, and we believe this helps spin the flywheel of our business faster. We are also starting to see green shoots in our retail media business, with Q1 representing our first full quarter of operations in this space. We have brought on additional retail media partners into the platform and are cautiously optimistic as spend continues to ramp up. With the durable top line performance in Q1, we generated $121 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 38% of revenue. The $121 million in adjusted EBITDA represents a 72% increase from a year ago. In Q1, we continued to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. Even recognizing that, I'm proud of our continued ability to consistently grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that has enabled our cash and short-term investments balance to end the quarter over the $1 billion mark for the first time. In the current environment, our demonstrated ability to invest for growth and self-fund our high-growth rates through profitable long-term cash flow generation sets us up well for the future. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. For Q1, video, including CTV, represented our largest percent of share on the platform, followed by mobile. Video and mobile each represented about 40% of spend. Display continued to grow well in Q1 and represented about 15% of spend, and audio represented about 5% of spend. Geographically, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. International's overall share, while relatively small for our overall business, dropped slightly from Q4 and the prior year. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America. That said, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, with European CTV spend more than doubling over the prior year in Q1. We did see a larger gap between our North American growth rate and international growth rate, particularly in the second half of Q1, mainly due to spend in Europe. However, through April, Europe has recovered to levels we saw early in Q1, although there is still some room to improve. I'm excited about our opportunities to grab share as we have proven that as our customers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help those customers and also spin our flywheel. It is still early days for us internationally, but we are optimistic about our market position and the long-term growth opportunity that we have. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them grew in the double digits during the quarter. Both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Shopping and food and drink were also very strong. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $207 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year. We continued to see significant operating leverage as we scale the business and improve our efficiency. Our income tax benefit of $2.7 million in the quarter was mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $146 million for Q1, and free cash flow was $136 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 88 days, down 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 72 days, down 3 days from a year ago. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.1 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $364 million, which would represent growth of 30% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $121 million in Q2. With a large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities ahead and continue to be motivated to invest thoughtfully in the business, placing a high importance on hiring to support future growth. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. I am pleased that over the past couple of years, the operating expense structure of the company has improved and is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. Doing so allows us to invest meaningfully in opportunities for growth while still generating strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In closing, we are excited about the momentum of our business with significant long-term growth drivers, including CTV, our international business, our retail media opportunity, which is only just beginning, our recent platform upgrade in Solimar and the upcoming U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. And the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well in the current environment. I believe we have the structure in place to continue driving long-term growth while scaling our business efficiently. And I'm cautiously optimistic about continued improvement in the future. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Shyam Patil from SIG.\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the results. I had a couple of questions. First one, Jeff, when we look at your results and your outlook, they look a lot better than what we\u2019ve seen from a lot of other ad-funded companies during earnings. Can you just talk about what you think is driving your outperformance? And then second question, can you talk a little bit about how you see the rest of the year shaping up?\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Shyam. Appreciate it. So I \u2013 as I look at the outperformance for this quarter, and I just look at all the things that would write in this quarter, it\u2019s hard not to start with connected television. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV had more positive changes than ever. And I don\u2019t know that I could have made up a better script in terms of just seeing companies like HBO move from sort of testing phase to scale. And then Netflix and Disney+ talking about ads were really created in an environment that is really optimal for ads. And of course, we already had great relationships with Paramount and Peacock and Sky and so many of those that you think of as the AVOD leaders to now have really everybody entering into this world of choice that is driven by ads. It\u2019s just a very exciting phenomenon. But I\u2019m also just very encouraged by the fact that, of course, there\u2019s macro pressures and noise and uncertainty that everybody has seen costs from war and inflation. And of course, the stock market bouncing around a lot. But in that environment, what we\u2019ve historically seen is that the moment when CMOs and marketers get very deliberate about where they\u2019re going to spend money, and they become very data-driven in the choices that they\u2019re making. And in our case, that means they\u2019re spending more with us. So I\u2019m just incredibly encouraged by all the things that we're \u2013we\u2019ve seen this quarter and how it sets it up for the rest of the year, which gets to the second half of your question. So with all these moves in advertising, especially from the global players of CTV, I think it really sets up the second half of the year for \u2013 around the world to see movement towards ad-funded CTV in a way that we started seeing early on in the pandemic. But I think we\u2019re seeing even more of now. We didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about shopper data. In the first quarter of this year, we also just had our first full quarter with Walmart and their DSP who\u2019s just doing really well. We have talked about new partnerships with Walgreens and Drizly. There have been others that have talked about our partnership with Target\u2019s media company, Roundel. So to have Walgreens, Walmart and Target on the platform and partners as it relates to data and measurement, just unbelievable. But just again, nearing a perfect setup as it relates to shopper partnerships. And then, of course, in the second half of the year, we\u2019re also going to have a midterm election. From recent events, that seems to be one that\u2019s going to be exciting as well. And I suspect just because of the momentum and attention that it will have more investment than most. And we think it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re very well positioned to have it be our biggest political year ever. Solimar is now over 80% adoption. So we\u2019ll finish that by the end of the year. So in other words, we\u2019ll move everything over to Solimar, the platform that we shipped on July 7, 7/7 last year. To go from launch to 100% adoption the following year is something that we were aiming for, but now we\u2019re extremely confident that we\u2019ll hit. And then we spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about UID and OpenPath. I mean we mentioned a longer list of names on OpenPath, but we didn\u2019t mention those that we mentioned in the press release just a couple of days ago. Buzzfeed, L.A. Times, Forbes, MediaVine, Red Ventures, which includes CNET and a whole bunch of others, have also been added to it just since last quarter that we announced publicly sent. So all of those amount to some amazing contributors to the second \u2013 or to the remainder of the year, say, second half, but to the remainder of the year.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities.\nYoussef Squali: Two, if I can. Jeff, 3 to 4 years ago, you were already on the strong opinion or the strong belief that Netflix has to offer an ad-supported model. That was just a matter of time. How do you feel about your chances of potentially partnering with Netflix around that opportunity and \u2013 or the potential risk of Netflix potentially building its own DSP, Amazon? And Blake, Q2 EBITDA implies a pretty big sequential and year-on-year drop, I think, to that 33%. Can you maybe just flesh out the biggest areas of investments and whether there is a typical kind of conservative built into that or \u2013 and just how should we think about that for the remainder of the year?\nA \u2013Jeff Green: Yes. Great. So you\u2019re right, I\u2019ve been saying for more than half a decade that I believe that Netflix will eventually have to show ads. And that\u2019s really based on the fact that I believe that consumers want choice. And that while Netflix has done a phenomenal job of preserving an amazing experience for consumers that at some point, that becomes cost prohibitive because you have to just keep raising prices, that is exactly what\u2019s happened over the years. And they\u2019re now at a place where I believe they will benefit from offering that choice. I think they have more pressure on them. Because of that history, I believe they have more pressure on them to create an amazing ad experience than anybody in the streaming competition, if you will. It\u2019s partly because of that, that \u2013 you may know, David Wells, who was the previous CFO of Netflix joined our Board almost 5 years ago. So we\u2019ve had a great relationship with Netflix because of him, and I\u2019m extremely optimistic in the potential for us to partner with Netflix. One thing that you should know \u2013 and Youssef, you \u2013 I think you put just words to something I\u2019ve heard from a few other people as well is why wouldn\u2019t Netflix build this themselves? So what most advertisers are trying to do, they are trying to manage what we call reach and frequency. Like how often do I show the same ad to the same consumer across apps and channels? And so if I just control how many times I show an ad on station 112 and then just control how they can they show an ad separately on station 114, and those 2 things don\u2019t talk to each other at all, you can waste a lot of money and show a lot of repetitive apps. This is why in traditional television, there\u2019s a lot of repetition. It\u2019s also why the ad break has so many ad in that. If Netflix were to provide an ad experience that have lots of repetition, in order for them to make the money that they need, they would have to show lots of them because the CPMs will be lower because they\u2019re less effective, which creates more repetition, and you get into that unfortunate cycle that I believe has happened in traditional television. The sure is way out of that is for them to partner with an objective independent DSP that manages reach and frequency and budgeting across all the fragmented pieces of streaming so that we can provide the very best ad experience for everybody because we\u2019ll be paying the highest prices, because of the fact that it\u2019s so much more efficient or effective. So I\u2019m very optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to create partnership with every major streaming company in the world, including Netflix. The fact that we have a phenomenal relationship with Discovery, and therefore, also Time Warner and HBO, we have great relationship with them. We have a fantastic relationship with Disney. We partnered for years with Peacock and with Paramount and so many others. Of course, I had the expectation that we\u2019ll do the same thing with Netflix.\nBlake Grayson: And Youssef, to follow up on your question on the EBITDA for Q2. Just to frame it up, I\u2019m really happy with our situation and where we are. Like we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we do expect in 2022 to increase the pace of our investment as we focus on the long-term growth of our business. And that\u2019s got a support from a very strong business model that produces strong free cash flow and has a really, really solid balance sheet. Our Q2 forecast reflects that. It includes accelerating hiring across the business, particularly in engineering, business development and account management roles that really play a huge factor in driving our long-term growth. We also expect our in-office expenses to start ramping this year to prepandemic levels. And we also anticipate hosting more employee events to get the team together. But in terms of this year, Q1 EBITDA was very strong. I\u2019m comfortable with our EBITDA trajectory and where things stand over the remainder of the year. And like we said last quarter, we do expect the operating expense structure of the company to be better than it was prior to the pandemic. And as I\u2019ve always said, this business is really built for and I\u2019m really optimistic about driving meaningful EBITDA and free cash flow as we scale. So I think that lots of great opportunities in front of us, and I feel pretty good about it.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt Swanson from RBC Capital.\nMatt Swanson: I\u2019ll add my congratulations on the quarter. Jeff, maybe staying on the theme of CTV and Netflix. You mentioned still having an abundance or maybe an overabundance of demand for CTV. Well, with the upfront is coming up, could you maybe give us an updated view on the supply-demand curve, especially for premium CTV content? And how you think about the addition of Netflix and Disney+ with all that content coming online and whether or not we\u2019ll see lower CPMs? And then I guess as was kind of a follow-up. Jeff, you mentioned that obviously, you saw Netflix coming from a long term \u2013 a long time away. When we think about the maturity curve now, though, for any subscription model hitting that threshold of payers, do you think this is going to change how new products launch from here on out when they see a Disney and Netflix and HBO Max all leading ads? Is \u2013 are we going to see any subscription-only products still get launched?\nJeff Green: First of all, I appreciate the congratulations. We\u2019re extremely excited about the results and as well as just all the things going in our direction, most notably on CTV. So appreciate that sentiment. So first, let me just address head on the concern that you raised in your first question. Will CPMs be lower as a result of this additional inventory? And can I just describe a little bit the demand? So the demand is really off the charts. And it\u2019s in large part because people are moving away from traditional cable television where there are just tons of ads and you\u2019re paying more and getting less than you have in a very long time. And so as a result, when you\u2019re adding new inventory, it\u2019s desperately needed. There\u2019s demand already lined up. And the thing that is really great about the way that we're seeing players like Disney or what I\u2019anticipate Netflix will do or HBO Max and then those that have been doing it for a while is that they\u2019re, of course, in order to continue subscribers, which is the way that they continue to gain subscribers, which is the way they\u2019re all graded, they have to have a great ad experience. They can\u2019t alienate users. That means that they have to provide relevance, and they have to provide very few ads. So that means we\u2019re going to see scarcity for a while, for as far as we can see in the future, honestly. And that means that there will be demand and that it is the best way for them to get incremental subscribers. Because I believe that those economics are becoming obvious \u2013 as obvious to everyone, so much so that the biggest names in the business seem to pivot very quickly that we\u2019re just SVOD, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strategically smart for anybody who\u2019s just entering the space now to start with SVOD only. It\u2019s like any product where over time as it evolves, if you launch the iPhone today or a new smartphone and it doesn\u2019t have features that rivals the iPhone 13, and instead, it rivals the features of iPhone 1, you\u2019re just not going to be competitive. You\u2019ve got to be at parity with the current state of the market. The current way to compete is to offer consumers choice. And I believe that, that becomes increasingly important for anybody entering streaming wars with hopes of competing with the biggest players in the space.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.\nVasily Karasyov: I have a couple, if I may. One on Europe. You said in the prepared remarks that spend did slow down around the start of the war in Ukraine, but then recovered in April. So can you tell us your thought maybe in more detail about what the advertising environment is in Europe right now and where it\u2019s going in your view? The second question is about political. You did make some comments on it, but wanted to see if you could give us more detail. So broadcasting companies have been reporting, and they\u2019re saying that they see a record political cycle spending so far. So can you tell us, please, how you feel you are positioned? And do you think this could be some incremental revenue growth this year from political?\nJeff Green: Yes. Sounds great. I\u2019m going to ask Blake to actually take a stand of both of them, and then I\u2019ll also take time with both of them. So Blake?\nA \u2013Blake Grayson: Sure. Thanks, Vasily, for the question. So with regards to Europe, just first to put into context, historically, our growth has been driven by the very strong position we have in the U.S. Europe represents a single-digit share of our spend. CTV has been the primary driver behind our growth in the U.S., but European CTV also gaining share. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about that more than doubled \u2013 they grew in the triple digits in Q1. We did see more of that gap \u2013 of a gap between North America and international in the second half, but it did \u2013 it recovered a bit in April and recovered back to what we were seeing in January. But there is still some room to improve. I think that, that\u2019s not a surprise, I think, for people who follow the space. The thing I think about when I think about opportunities like that is when customers become more deliberate with spend and they focus on the most efficient investment opportunities, that\u2019s when The Trade Desk tends to shine because from my perspective, we proved it out in the second half of 2020 when we saw that as people needed to be more deliberate, they were focusing on the areas of investment that have the highest ROI, then they were consulting with us, and it worked out actually quite well in our favor. So I\u2019m super optimistic about that. With regards to political, yes, it\u2019s a great opportunity for us, and we\u2019ll see how this ramps up because it\u2019s going to probably start ramping up for us over the summer into November, obviously. You\u2019ve seen reports that talk about midterm election spend on par or better than the 2020 presidential elections. The one thing I would encourage you to think about as you go through the forecasting is that seasonality is going to be different than we saw in 2020, so you\u2019ll need to take that into account. There\u2019s still a lot of factors to consider like the number of competitive races out there and stuff. But we do believe we\u2019ve set ourselves up to be the kind of go-to platform for this political advertising versus maybe social media platforms and such. And we\u2019ll have more color on this as we progress in 2022, more in the second half of the year, but definitely look forward to some tailwinds there. And then whatever, Jeff, you want to add on top.\nJeff Green: Yes. So first, I agree with everything Blake just said. He covered almost all of it. I\u2019ll just add a little bit more color. So first, I\u2019ve been to Europe twice in the last 4-ish months, and that\u2019s in large part because there\u2019s just such an opportunity shaping up in connected television. In various markets, we\u2019re seeing just a lot of movement from even some of the companies that previously hadn\u2019t embraced ads and certainly programmatic open Internet ads and are now doing just that. And now with pressure from some of the biggest global players, we\u2019re seeing them move relatively quickly, which is why we saw CTV up over 2x in Q1 in EMEA. So just very excited by the momentum. Even in the very rare cases where there\u2019s pauses or there\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve seen some supply chains coming from Ukraine that are a little bit more affected in EMEA, the sentiment is very positive as it relates to their intentions to spend with us in the rest of the year. So I\u2019ve got both of the trips in the last 4 months, more positive than when I got there and believing that what most people are doing is exactly what we described in the prepared remarks, which is when there\u2019s some economic pressure or they have to do more with less, they become very data-driven, and they become closer partners of ours during that time. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m seeing everywhere around the world and maybe as much in EMEA as anywhere else. On the political, I\u2019ll just underline what Blake said on \u2013 the seasonality is a little bit different in midterm and election than it is in the presidential election. So we expect to see more hit the second half. We also heard similar reports of just this potentially being record-setting for political on the macro. But I\u2019ll just say lastly, on the political, we \u2013 I\u2019m really proud of what we\u2019ve proven in the last couple of election cycles, which is that we can objectively represent the Democratic party as well as the Republican party that we can support a fair process and that buying in programmatic and in a data-driven way, there\u2019s room for both parties to run a better process than what they have in other mediums, including, in some cases, in social. So we\u2019re really excited about what we\u2019ve proven in the past and believe that we\u2019ve set ourselves up to do more for both parties and even the more independent than what we have ever done before. So excited about what that means for the second half of the year in particular.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: I\u2019ll just ask one. Just want to focus back on CTV. So for a very long time, Google wanted to get into this, and the media companies don\u2019t want them basically doing programmatic CTV. While they let them do YouTube TV, right, that YouTube isn\u2019t doing the ads. And we\u2019ve seen media companies try to own technology assets \u2013 ad tech assets and have not been good at it. And I guess, Jeff, your perspective, I mean, given what we\u2019ve now almost seen as kind of like the undoing of some of the media mergers, where there\u2019s like a clear idea that content owners need to be content owners and maybe just be the best of that because it\u2019s so competitive, just how do you see how that kind of impacts your space on the board, and ultimately, to be potentially like the default partner to help the media companies with this transition?\nJeff Green: Yes. So I think your assessment sort of that\u2019s built into your question is spot on. I just \u2013 I believe the tolerance for conflict of interest among media companies and technology companies is lower than in almost any other place. So I think it\u2019s really interesting that Google decided to go to the upfronts this year. They scheduled their upfronts right on top of Disney\u2019s, of which is just sort of bad form and certainly not a way to win friends. And I think that\u2019s somewhat representative of the way they are being received among many of the media companies. So I think it\u2019s just such an amazing backdrop for us to be in the CTV space, being one of, and in many cases, the very biggest provider of ad demand for some of the biggest media companies in the world, and they\u2019re leaning into our partnerships in a way they have never before. It\u2019s just really incredible. And that\u2019s largely because they know who we are. We are very clear on the value that we provide. We are not trying to compete with them. We don\u2019t own any content. We are constantly \u2013 well, publicly and privately reassuring them that we will not own content. And we do that so that we can create a more effective supply chain, but also so that we can partner with them and just be very upfront about who we are and what we do because we think that\u2019s the best way to be competitive today. And so because we think that they are, to some extent, doing the exact same thing, they \u2013 even companies like that, that were somewhat hybrid content and technology companies have largely become a content manufacturing machine. And so it just creates opportunity for us to partner because we\u2019re all becoming very clear on who we are and what we do rather than some tech behemoth that wants to be everything, right? And Amazon competes with nearly every business and the S&P 500 at this point. And I think that becomes increasingly problematic, especially in the intersection of media and tech.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Maybe if you can give us a quick update on Walmart and any critical milestones that you\u2019ve had and how you look at that through the second half of \u201822.\nA \u2013Jeff Green: You bet. Yes. If there\u2019s any topic that didn\u2019t get its due, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a rival between our data marketplace and our shopper marketing efforts. And so as I did mention, though, we just finished our first full quarter with Walmart. We saw over 200 advertisers. These are all very large brands \u2013 provide test budgets during that time. We expect even more large brands and more expansion as we continue forward. And we think that this is going to be just an amazing growth driver over the next 5 years. We, of course, saw some early tests and some amazing results from CPGs, as you might expect. But I don\u2019t know that enough has been said about what is being done by companies like Walgreens and Target and Drizly, and this Target\u2019s division Roundel because what they\u2019re largely doing is really changing the way measurement works in CPG and really anything that\u2019s primarily built \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, bought off-line because what it makes possible is the ability t\u2019 measure from the \u2013me\u2019you show the ad to the time somebody buys the product and measure that end-to-end using retail data instead of a walled garden or technology companies sort of grading their own homework data. And so by having that collection there, we now put together this mosaic that really creates this amazing marketplace that we even call the measurement marketplace for anybody that\u2019s selling products that are largely bought in those stores. And then, of course, those stores spin their flywheel faster. So the green shoots are fantastic. We\u2019ve merely scratched the surface, but we\u2019re very excited about the start that we\u2019ve had and very excited about our partnerships with Walmart, Walgreens and Drizly, Roundel, and GoJet and Flybuys and so many others. I\u2019m not even listing half of the internationals, but very excited about all the progress.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Mark Zgutowicz from The Benchmark Company.\nMark Zgutowicz: Jeff, I was just hoping you could maybe define what you consider the large publisher market in terms of having, I guess, the majority of loyal signed-in users and how many you think you need to sign on to UID2 for your platform to come close to replacing cookie scale, when and if Google shuts down cookies? And then just in terms of UID2, what's the status on finding an administrator for UID2, and particularly the importance of that in Europe? Appreciate answers to those.\nJeff Green: You bet. So in terms of loyal signed-on users, it's actually a fairly complicated question because there is a question of how many users are signed on, but then there's also like how connected are those to sign-ins on other websites. So to sort of boil it down to what I think is the most important and easiest to explain concept, there is some amount of the Internet that needs to be logged in, in order to create the ability to model or predict what's happening on the rest of it. Instantly, this is exactly the same way that companies that use log-ins today like Google or Facebook as they're a primary identity mechanism rather than cookies. That's exactly why they're in a good position is that they'll use that and then model on some additional percentage. In general, we've seen this from some of the independent data companies. You really need only about 10% to be logged in, in order to model well on all the rest of it. I actually think that the numbers can end up being much, much higher than that in terms of what will actually be logged in and what will actually be available on UID if the trends that we predict continue. So that's the first part of your question. On the -- can you remind me the second part of your question?\nMark Zgutowicz: Yes. So I was just wondering if you \u2013 what the progress is on finding an administrator for UID2? By administrator, meaning somebody who\u2019s willing to accept liability for violations of GDPR.\nA \u2013Jeff Green: Yes. So because of the fact that \u2013 so first, there\u2019s a European issue, and then there\u2019s the administrator issue in other parts of the world as well, including in the United States. The position that we\u2019ve taken so far is that we wanted to make UID2 an open source project so that it was available to everybody and sort of administering or managing that code base so that it could be available to everybody was the most important first order of business. And that we\u2019ve done with the IAB, and we\u2019ve done that based here in the United States, but it\u2019s available everywhere in the world. As it relates to administration of its operation, because essentially, you\u2019re handing over control at that point, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. You can hand over a liability. You can also hand over some of its future. That\u2019s something that we want to be very certain is good and secure before we hand that off. So we\u2019re in no rush to do that, whether that\u2019s with [IV] in the United States or any entity in Europe. And because in Europe, everybody is essentially taking some amount of risk if you take on the role of controller. So I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s an effective way to distribute or mitigate risk at this point. So there\u2019s nothing \u2013 we\u2019re in no rush to do that. And instead, what we want to make certain that we do, especially in Europe, but really everywhere around the world, is develop a system that can scale and make sure that early on, we partner with companies that we believe are being responsible, that are doing the right thing and that we establish very clearly the quid pro quos and opt-outs that are in compliance with GDPR. And we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant ID in the world, but we will make it interoperable with others that we believe are also doing the right thing, and that\u2019s going to create a better Internet, one that I think is really important for Europe and optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to see scale. But we\u2019re much more early days in EUID than we are in UID2 because there\u2019s just a lot more things to consider and a much more political environment. So I\u2019m just excited of the progress at this point.\nOperator: The final question will be from Michael Morris from Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris: I\u2019ll try to squeeze in 2 final questions. The first one is on the pretty consistent comment that you made, Jeff, about The Trade Desk being the default DSP for the open Internet. Obviously, this implies potential for a pretty universal adoption across buyers. So I\u2019m curious if you can elaborate on where you are now in terms of partner penetration. You referenced over 1,000 customers. But any frame of reference or what that means for full penetration, sort of how that\u2019s been trending would be helpful. And the second question is a little bit of elaboration on the impacts of Netflix and other peers introducing these global ad-supported businesses, which are pretty new to market, of course. Does this drive an acceleration in your investment internationally? Any other kind of fundamental changes that this makes to the industry?\nA \u2013Jeff Green: You bet. So as it relates to partner penetration, I\u2019m trying to think of the best way to quantify it. In general, I believe that we have only scratched the surface. I\u2019m sometimes referencing last year, we had over $6 billion flow through the platform, but we\u2019re still looking at a nearly $1 trillion TAM in terms of what\u2019s spent in total global advertising. So we\u2019re still just merely scratching the surface and a tiny amount of what\u2019s possible. When you look at how many of those dollars are spent in the Fortune 500, while we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019ve done inside of the Fortune 500 among the biggest advertisers, when you become the default for them and learn how to support the most sophisticated in the world, of course, it then gives you room to do similar things for midsized businesses, midsized agencies as we\u2019ve always supported agencies. We continue to expand among \u2013 more and more midsized agencies, and that\u2019s giving us a wider variety of clients, which is why we added so many advertisers both directly and through agencies in Q1. So I think this was a quarter where we added more to the sort of quantity of advertisers and agencies than we usually have. But it then tees up the opportunity for us to then get a greater share of wallet where I think there\u2019s just still way more upside than sort of dollars we already have. You asked if the \u2013 the expansion that we\u2019re seeing, especially from these global CTV players, if that will increase our investment around the world. I do think it will. Maybe not immediately, but I believe that investment will happen in the coming months and quarters. And that\u2019s largely because it\u2019s difficult to pay for a subscription and avoid the ads. Like in the prepared remarks, I made that reference or the analogy to traditional television where it\u2019s really a luxury to pay for a station that doesn\u2019t have any ads. It costs more. And so if you think about most markets outside the United States have a median household income that is lower than the United States. And so as a result, most of them would prefer to pay by seeing ads than by paying a premium. And especially if you\u2019re fighting like hell to go get more subscribers, that becomes the very best way for you to grow in new markets. Incidentally, advertisers also love that, especially when you\u2019re looking at places like Asia, but even some of the markets in Europe, where there\u2019s just such a growth of middle class not to \u2013 occur \u2013 or occurring right now that just is a great time to advertise when people\u2019s wealth is growing for the first time to levels that give them sort of unprecedented purchasing power. So I definitely think that will result in investments from us around the world. And I do think it will change the CTV landscape around the world to have companies that were historically U.S. companies that continue to become more of a force internationally. And I think ad-supported business models will make them stronger competitors around the world, not weaker.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you've seen from the press release, we are off to a great start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 43% compared with last year, our fastest first quarter growth rate in the last 4 years. Our strong growth is a testament to a variety of factors that I want to touch on today and which give us significant optimism for the future. Our performance is especially encouraging because annual advertising budgets are often being reset and reconsidered in Q1, making them historically harder to predict. And this year, the macro environment was challenging with the ongoing global pandemic, war in the Ukraine and the higher rates of inflation around the world. Despite those challenges, we again exceeded our own expectations. I believe we are now firmly established as the default DSP for the open Internet and that we are very well positioned to grow and grab share regardless of the macro environment. We now have over 1,000 customers, representing tens of thousands of advertisers spending on our platform across the open Internet. We continue to see a steady stream of new agencies and brands starting to work with us for the first time as well as existing customers increasing their spend with us. We are seeing strong momentum around key initiatives such as Connected TV, Shopper Data, UID2, OpenPath and our game-changing new data marketplace. In each case, we are working with our advertising clients to drive maximum value from their campaign dollars. And this, in turn, helps us grow our trusted relationships with the world's leading brands and agencies, many of whom are signing long-term strategic partnerships with us. As a CEO, it's always important for me to look at how we are performing relative to the industry. For example, the IAB and PwC predict digital advertising will increase approximately 8% in 2022. Publicis Group's Zenith estimates the increase at about 14%. But either way, we continue to grow at a pace well ahead of industry estimates, which means we are gaining share and adding significant value. I continue to be extremely optimistic in part because of the combination of our exceptional 95% plus retention rate and our significant growth rate. There are macroeconomic forces, which have changed the media and technology landscape dramatically in the last few months, especially in CTV, which also gives me optimism. As many of you know, I have spent many of the last 10 years publicly predicting that Netflix and nearly everyone else would eventually show out. Netflix recently announced that they are likely to make ads a part of their future. This and so many other great things are happening in CTV. In fact, I can't think of a time that the TV landscape has had more positive changes in a short period of time than what has happened in Q1 of this year. I want to spend the biggest lot of time on that. But in order to discuss the significance of what's happening in CTV, we first need to discuss what's happening with 2 foundational initiatives: first, our work on a new identity framework for the Internet; and second, our work to make the supply chain more efficient. So first, identity. The Internet has been operating on a quid pro quo since it became commercial, but the Internet has been a suboptimal Internet. And by that, I mean we've used cookies as a make-shift technology to enable relevant advertising. But due to a series of events and choices, cookies are going away. Currently, Google has the majority of the browser market share around the entire Internet outside of China. So they decided when this transition is going to take place, and they currently targeted the end of Q1 2023. This has created a very unique community to upgrade the Internet. Indeed, without those many circumstances, this opportunity wouldn't exist. We are upgrading from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. The open Internet is scrambling to coordinate and collectively upgrade. Many different opt-in IDs are being created. Some of them will scale and survive, some won't. However, those that scale will be distributed, encrypted and interoperable. We don't believe IDs can or will scale if they don't upgrade the experience for consumers. With this in mind, we developed and launched UID2. This is the second version of UID, version 2 being e-mail and phone number-based instead of cookie-based. This allows consumers to take their privacy settings and controls with them all over the Internet without loss of control or a false sense of security. Some of the privacy protection that has been promised to consumers by large technology companies with billions of log-ins have misled some consumers to believe that they control privacy, opt-in and the quid pro quo of the Internet across CTVs, mobile environments and computer browsers. UID actually does enable consumers to set preferences and restrictions for each Web publisher, mobile app and CTV app. They choose who they trust and can change their mind. Their preferences are tied to an encrypted, hashed, salted ID based on e-mail address or phone number that a consumer can take with them. Because this move to an upgraded opt-in Internet is scheduled to happen in about 10 months based on the date Google deprecates third-party cookies in Chrome, the entire open Internet ecosystem is thinking about identity, and we continue to make significant progress with UID2. And I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about this progress and the various innovations that are driving that progress. In terms of the number of unique IDs, we are now measuring UIDs on billions of devices. With every passing month, we are posting new all-time highs. That comes as more advertisers activate on UID2 and as more publishers adopt it. Let me give you one quick example, which is particularly illustrative of the business value of UID2. MediaVine is a company that manages advertising for more than 8,500 independent publishers. Those include some large publishers like the Hollywood Gossip and some very niche publishers like Steamy Kitchen. They're big. They are a comScore top 5 lifestyle media platform with more than 130 million monthly viewers and 17 billion monthly ad impressions.  MediaVine has now adopted and deployed UID2. Their publishers have seen CPMs increase more than 100%. With UID2, they can create privacy safe identifiers for their readers, pass those on safely to advertisers who can then serve relevant advertising without ever knowing anything directly identifiable about the reader. Better opt-ins and more sign-ins, including new lightweight SSOs, is what a post-cookie Internet is going to look like. And pioneering advertisers, publishers and CTV providers are building that Internet now. Momentum is amazing, but we're still in the early stages, simply because the Internet is so big. This work is both inevitable and essential. Without relevant advertising, CPMs will [crater]. That's the fundamental value exchange of the Internet, relevant advertising in exchange for free content. That's why so many publishers are implementing UID2 with many already reporting strong CPM growth. The ecosystem of UID partners also continues to expand. InfoSum, a leading data collaboration platform, recently signed up as another closed operator of UID2. Many leading advertisers and their agencies, including Omnicom, already use InfoSum to activate their first-party data and are excited about this partnership as they look to unlock the value of that data while maintaining control over it using UID2. AppLovin also recently joined the UID ecosystem. AppLovin is one of the world's leading mobile in-app ad exchanges, and our advertisers now have access to ad opportunities across more than 140,000 apps and 1.8 billion devices with the precision and relevance that UID2 creates. The solutions such as UID2 allow us to manage that value exchange in a way that improves the experience for all parties. I believe this new approach will ultimately result in an upgrade to the Internet. We also recently announced that we are launching a version of UID2 that will be tailored for the European market called EUID. To understand the connection between UID2 and EUID, consider an analogy to Chrome and Chromium. Chromium is a free open-source development platform for Web browsers. Many browsers use core elements of Chromium, including Google Chrome, which uses Chromium as a foundation, but which is enhanced and adapted by Google. Essentially Chrome is one iteration built on top of Chromium. In the same way, UID2 is an open-source project and EUID is a version of it, developed for Europe that meets the specific needs of that market, especially the legislative requirements. Building this specific version also allows us to build in the features that give our partners reassurance that data will not leave Europe, even for international companies that do business and have data in Europe. With this approach, we believe that EUID is the most GDPR-compliant identity solution in the market today. In order for the open Internet to thrive, it will require more authentication or logging in. High CPMs and relevance will gravitate to publishers and content owners who have logged in users. CTV and new sites and apps especially have a unique opportunity at this moment as the identity foundation of the Internet being rebuilt. The CTV leaders understand this. Nearly every CTV ad is shown on the authenticated side of a log-in, almost always via an e-mail or phone number, which means CTV already operates in an opt-in environment unlike much of the rest of the Internet, which is still an opt-out, although it's transitioning. Within that environment, broadcasters can work with advertisers to build the new identity fabric of the Internet that provides addressability while significantly upgrading consumer privacy. And new identity solutions, including UID2, are key here. With UID2, advertisers can safely onboard first-party data. And then with interoperability with CTV apps, they can find valuable audiences, both current and prospects, exactly when they are viewing their favorite premium content.  Ultimately, this is a much better advertising experience than one based on cookies. Cookies were never really intended to do this work. They were just co-opted. But in new technology environments like CTV we can build a new identity framework that allows advertisers to create relevance, enables publishers to maximize yield and hand consumers much more control over their privacy. So in many ways, the CTV ecosystem will pioneer the future of identity. To be clear, it's not about any one identity solution. It's about interoperability. This new fabric will include new currencies such as UID2, but also other identifiers, whether it's those developed by CTV providers themselves, measurement, partners like Nielsen or by companies such as LiveRamp. And we are working with all of them to ensure this new fabric pays off those promises I just outlined for all participants. There is so much to discuss today that I'm going to bookmark a related issue that I'd like to discuss in a future call, our data marketplace. The data marketplace is as healthy as ever, largely because UID2 and a better opt-in environment creates a better foundation for our data marketplace, which has the potential to become the largest in the world. I don't think any walled garden can ever create a data marketplace to rival it. Already, we have enacted massive marketplace design upgrades. As a result, we're already seeing higher data usage, better CPAs and ROI for advertisers, better margins and a faster spinning flywheel for us. We have once again stair-step increased the consumer surplus of our offering to our clients. There is so much more to report on this and more change and benefit to come, so I'm excited to talk about that in the future. Related to all the progress we're making with UID is the recent launch of OpenPath. We announced it in our last earnings report, and I'd like to give an update today. First, a reminder of what it is. OpenPath is a way for our advertisers to plug directly into publisher inventory via our platform. By plugging in directly, publishers have the opportunity to capture the value of an opt-in Internet and implement changes that benefit all participants, including advertisers and agencies. I do want to reiterate that this does not mean that The Trade Desk is getting into the SSB or supply side business. OpenPath is simply a direct path to inventory with publishers that already have their own yield management solutions. OpenPath helps eliminate steps in the process where there may be fees or charges with no value in return. For example, since we announced OpenPath, we have shut down Google's open bidding on our platform. When we announced OpenPath a few months ago, we also had commitments from news organizations that represent a majority of news consumers in the United States, organizations such as Reuters, the Washington Post, Gannett, Conde Nast, which owns Vanity Fair, Vogue, The New Yorker and many others, McClatchy, which owns more than 30 leading daily newspapers, including The Kansas City Star and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Hearst Magazines and Newspapers, which operate major titles such as the Cosmopolitan and the San Francisco Chronicle, the Tribune Group and several others. In the days following the announcement, we had more than 100 inbound inquiries from major publishers looking to join the initiative. We're prioritizing journalism as we launch OpenPath because nowhere is the danger of the absence of identity more apparent. Recently, we announced more journalistic publishers committing to OpenPath, including the L.A. Times, BuzzFeed, Forbes, MediaVine and Red Ventures, which includes publications such as CNET and Lonely Planet. As more publishers adopt OpenPath, they will make UID2 deployment or interoperability a key element of their plan. In doing so, they can activate their own first-party subscriber data in a way that protects that data but also provides enough relevance to advertisers that we can enhance the value of those ad impressions and yield for publishers. For those that don't show most of their ads after a user has logged in, OpenPath will include a simple UID2-based SSO that will help them make this essential transition to a post-cookie environment. Let me bring this back to CTV because CTV is really the epicenter of open Internet identity. We've seen massive moves in the CTV landscape recently. In 2021, we added exponentially more inventory, thanks to new partnerships with a wide range of partners, including Peacock, Paramount Plus, Discovery Plus and Sky. Early this year, we entered a scaled relationship with HBO Max, one of the most recent and fastest-growing content companies to aggressively adopt ad-funded subscriptions for consumers. On a more macro level, Amazon bought MGM and streams ads through IMDB TV. Just this year so far, Disney+ announced that ads would be added as a choice to their app. Microsoft acquired Xandr. Time Warner left the AT&T family and is now owned by Discovery and is mostly led by Discovery Plus leadership, which is one of the most savvy programmatic teams in TV. And of course, Netflix recently announced that it will likely make ads available on their platform. These major changes in the landscape have huge implications for the future of CTV and programmatic. A tailored TV ad is probably the most effective scaled advertising available today on or off-line. As a result, for most of our clients, TV is the largest segment of their campaign spend. That unique combination of video and audio delivered at a time when the audience is leaned in, remains the most effective way to touch the hearts and minds of consumers. As those consumers have shifted in mass to streaming platforms, advertisers are following them. For consumers, on-demand content is just better. As content owners and the streaming apps are competing for more subscribers, it has become very clear, providing consumers with choice is the only way to win. This is a great setup for Netflix. By not having ads to date, Netflix has protected an amazing user experience, but it required Netflix to keep raising prices so that they could keep making and buying content. At some point, price becomes an issue for nearly all consumers. Consider what we can learn from TV of the past. Even in the days of cable bundles, very few consumers pay for every premium channel, Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, NBA League Pass, et cetera.  In the past, nearly all channels have had ads. Now once again, consumers will have something better, choice. Netflix will very likely set up a clean option for consumers, see ads and pay meaningfully less or pay slightly more and avoid ads altogether. Consumers will continue to be given more choices. I predict that with this move, Netflix will continue to be something of a pace car in TV innovation. They were the first ones to really nail the subscription model for CTV. They were the first to 100 million global subscribers, the first to 200 million, and they continue to lead that race today. And now they are embracing consumer choice as a way to expand their market share even further. It's important to note that at least half of Netflix subscribers are outside the United States. So the implications to this move has global ramifications to the world of CTV. But there will even be more to this part of the story. As Netflix explores advertising options, they will be unburdened by legacy processes that some of their competitors are working through. For example, they will be able to structure their advertising operations so they don't have sales channel conflict. They can be data-driven from the start in everything that they do, using data to ensure that they maximize yield on every ad impression. In all of these dimensions, and likely many others, I believe Netflix will continue to innovate and set the pace. And as with any market, others will have to adapt accordingly. Many of them already are. We are working on these opportunities with leading CTV providers every single day. HBO Max, Disney+ and Netflix are all public about their intentions to implement ad experiences. This adds pressure to all content owners to accelerate the move to data-driven buying and selling and finding ways to make the most competitive consumer experience, which means limited relevant ads with high CPMs. For CTV to continue to produce the amazing and expensive content that is driving this new golden age of television, relevant ads are the only way to fund and preserve it. This requires CTV to participate in the open Internet because in walled gardens, one cannot control universal reach and frequency. Additionally, I believe this means every CTV company around the world is racing to create this optimal viewing experience. CTV has historically competed regionally due to the licensing and broadcast regulations. Netflix and YouTube have made this a global race. We're seeing content owners all over the world quickly adapting to these recent moves. Recently, I've personally spoken about this directly with some of our content partners in the United States and in Europe. They are already feeling the pressure to move fast and to improve their ad experiences. This messaging from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max is requiring everyone to embrace biddable environments and move away from legacy models like upfronts and even programmatic guarantees where advertiser choice is limited. These changes in the TV landscape also have adjusted marketers' mindsets. As advertisers are seeing reach and impact erode from traditional cable television, they are focused on moving to premium streaming content. Increasingly, this is the most important buy on the media plan. Marketers want to advertise against premium content as much as possible. It's content they can trust. It's content that reflects their own brand. It's content they can activate on and measure against with precision. As advertisers prioritize ads on premium content on our platform, they are beginning to start their campaign planning there, too. As a result, user-generated content is increasingly getting the leftovers. With the explosive growth of premium CTV over the last few years, especially the last year, the trend is clear. We see it clearly reflected in some of the UGC data that's been reported out in the last few weeks, and it's also why CTV remains by far our fastest-growing channel and why premium video in all of its forms has become the largest segment of our business. This trend will be equally apparent internationally where there is also a flight to premium content. We work with many of the Fortune 500 companies, almost all of whom direct their advertising campaigns at multiple international markets. As more premium supply comes online, particularly premium video, we have more than enough demand to satisfy it. And we could not be more excited about what this shift from Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max means in terms of opening the door of AVOD supply. Not only in major markets that have already embraced CTV advertising such as Western Europe and Australia, but also in many other markets where AVOD will be a vital driver of subscription growth because of tighter economic pressure on consumer wallets. Premium video, where everything is authenticated, is one of those key areas where the future of Internet identity is being forged, not just for CTV, but across the open Internet, including inside the browser. That may not seem obvious as cookies are not present in CTV. And so you'd think they'd be less affected by the potential phaseout of cookies next year. But CTV needs persistent identity to have effective and high CPM ads, and they need high CPM ads to fund that content. It's economics that's driving that process. As more CTV leaders embrace advertising, they want to ensure that they create as much addressability as possible because that's the only way that they can maintain high CPMs. An advertiser will pay, say, a $12 CPM if they know the viewers are watching the latest hot reality show, but they will pay 3x that if there's a reasonable chance those viewers are interested in their product. And that's why they will be among the pioneers of the new identity framework or the open Internet. I'd like to wrap this up by bringing us back to the market opportunity in front of us. The global advertising industry is moving rapidly towards a $1 trillion TAM. As the market grows, the majority of that spend will be digital, and all of it will ultimately be traded programmatically. At the same time, the industry is making important progress in several dimensions in building the Internet advertising ecosystem of the future, one that no longer relies on cookies. The Internet is getting an upgrade. We're moving from an opt-out Internet to an opt-in Internet. Everything is founded on a better identity framework. On that foundation comes better controls for consumers, more choices for consumers on how to pay for CTV subscriptions, whether that's with money or with ad time, and better measurement and data. As the ecosystem continues to evolve and move away from walled gardens led by CTV, we will unleash the power of programmatic for our advertisers and for our publisher partners. It will be an improved experience for everyone, consumers included. The innovations we are driving to help accomplish this are already delivering performance improvements for us today. They are a key factor in why we are off to such a positive start in 2022 and why we are so optimistic about our growth opportunities looking forward. As I said earlier, advertisers are increasingly gravitating to our platform as the de facto DSP of the open Internet led by CTV. And we will continue to innovate to reinforce that leadership position and deliver more value to our advertisers. Our profitable business model allows us complete flexibility to make these investments and continue to drive growth. In doing so, we will help build a better Internet for all stakeholders, and all of that is what makes me so excited about our growth prospects. With that, I will hand the call over to Blake, who will take you through more of the financial details. You bet. Thanks, Shyam. Appreciate it. So I \u2013 as I look at the outperformance for this quarter, and I just look at all the things that would write in this quarter, it's hard not to start with connected television. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the CTV had more positive changes than ever. And I don't know that I could have made up a better script in terms of just seeing companies like HBO move from sort of testing phase to scale. And then Netflix and Disney+ talking about ads were really created in an environment that is really optimal for ads. And of course, we already had great relationships with Paramount and Peacock and Sky and so many of those that you think of as the AVOD leaders to now have really everybody entering into this world of choice that is driven by ads. It's just a very exciting phenomenon. But I'm also just very encouraged by the fact that, of course, there's macro pressures and noise and uncertainty that everybody has seen costs from war and inflation. And of course, the stock market bouncing around a lot. But in that environment, what we've historically seen is that the moment when CMOs and marketers get very deliberate about where they're going to spend money, and they become very data-driven in the choices that they're making. And in our case, that means they're spending more with us. So I'm just incredibly encouraged by all the things that we're \u2013we've seen this quarter and how it sets it up for the rest of the year, which gets to the second half of your question. So with all these moves in advertising, especially from the global players of CTV, I think it really sets up the second half of the year for \u2013 around the world to see movement towards ad-funded CTV in a way that we started seeing early on in the pandemic. But I think we're seeing even more of now. We didn't spend a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about shopper data. In the first quarter of this year, we also just had our first full quarter with Walmart and their DSP who's just doing really well. We have talked about new partnerships with Walgreens and Drizly. There have been others that have talked about our partnership with Target's media company, Roundel. So to have Walgreens, Walmart and Target on the platform and partners as it relates to data and measurement, just unbelievable. But just again, nearing a perfect setup as it relates to shopper partnerships. And then, of course, in the second half of the year, we're also going to have a midterm election. From recent events, that seems to be one that's going to be exciting as well. And I suspect just because of the momentum and attention that it will have more investment than most. And we think it's \u2013 we're very well positioned to have it be our biggest political year ever. Solimar is now over 80% adoption. So we'll finish that by the end of the year. So in other words, we'll move everything over to Solimar, the platform that we shipped on July 7, 7/7 last year. To go from launch to 100% adoption the following year is something that we were aiming for, but now we're extremely confident that we'll hit. And then we spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about UID and OpenPath. I mean we mentioned a longer list of names on OpenPath, but we didn't mention those that we mentioned in the press release just a couple of days ago. Buzzfeed, L.A. Times, Forbes, MediaVine, Red Ventures, which includes CNET and a whole bunch of others, have also been added to it just since last quarter that we announced publicly sent. So all of those amount to some amazing contributors to the second \u2013 or to the remainder of the year, say, second half, but to the remainder of the year. First of all, I appreciate the congratulations. We're extremely excited about the results and as well as just all the things going in our direction, most notably on CTV. So appreciate that sentiment. So first, let me just address head on the concern that you raised in your first question. Will CPMs be lower as a result of this additional inventory? And can I just describe a little bit the demand? So the demand is really off the charts. And it's in large part because people are moving away from traditional cable television where there are just tons of ads and you're paying more and getting less than you have in a very long time. And so as a result, when you're adding new inventory, it's desperately needed. There's demand already lined up. And the thing that is really great about the way that we're seeing players like Disney or what I'anticipate Netflix will do or HBO Max and then those that have been doing it for a while is that they're, of course, in order to continue subscribers, which is the way that they continue to gain subscribers, which is the way they're all graded, they have to have a great ad experience. They can't alienate users. That means that they have to provide relevance, and they have to provide very few ads. So that means we're going to see scarcity for a while, for as far as we can see in the future, honestly. And that means that there will be demand and that it is the best way for them to get incremental subscribers. Because I believe that those economics are becoming obvious \u2013 as obvious to everyone, so much so that the biggest names in the business seem to pivot very quickly that we're just SVOD, I don't think it's strategically smart for anybody who's just entering the space now to start with SVOD only. It's like any product where over time as it evolves, if you launch the iPhone today or a new smartphone and it doesn't have features that rivals the iPhone 13, and instead, it rivals the features of iPhone 1, you're just not going to be competitive. You've got to be at parity with the current state of the market. The current way to compete is to offer consumers choice. And I believe that, that becomes increasingly important for anybody entering streaming wars with hopes of competing with the biggest players in the space. Yes. Sounds great. I'm going to ask Blake to actually take a stand of both of them, and then I'll also take time with both of them. So Blake?\nA \u2013Blake Grayson: Sure. Thanks, Vasily, for the question. So with regards to Europe, just first to put into context, historically, our growth has been driven by the very strong position we have in the U.S. Europe represents a single-digit share of our spend. CTV has been the primary driver behind our growth in the U.S., but European CTV also gaining share. I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about that more than doubled \u2013 they grew in the triple digits in Q1. We did see more of that gap \u2013 of a gap between North America and international in the second half, but it did \u2013 it recovered a bit in April and recovered back to what we were seeing in January. But there is still some room to improve. I think that, that's not a surprise, I think, for people who follow the space. The thing I think about when I think about opportunities like that is when customers become more deliberate with spend and they focus on the most efficient investment opportunities, that's when The Trade Desk tends to shine because from my perspective, we proved it out in the second half of 2020 when we saw that as people needed to be more deliberate, they were focusing on the areas of investment that have the highest ROI, then they were consulting with us, and it worked out actually quite well in our favor. So I'm super optimistic about that. With regards to political, yes, it's a great opportunity for us, and we'll see how this ramps up because it's going to probably start ramping up for us over the summer into November, obviously. You've seen reports that talk about midterm election spend on par or better than the 2020 presidential elections. The one thing I would encourage you to think about as you go through the forecasting is that seasonality is going to be different than we saw in 2020, so you'll need to take that into account. There's still a lot of factors to consider like the number of competitive races out there and stuff. But we do believe we've set ourselves up to be the kind of go-to platform for this political advertising versus maybe social media platforms and such. And we'll have more color on this as we progress in 2022, more in the second half of the year, but definitely look forward to some tailwinds there. And then whatever, Jeff, you want to add on top. Yes. So first, I agree with everything Blake just said. He covered almost all of it. I'll just add a little bit more color. So first, I've been to Europe twice in the last 4-ish months, and that's in large part because there's just such an opportunity shaping up in connected television. In various markets, we're seeing just a lot of movement from even some of the companies that previously hadn't embraced ads and certainly programmatic open Internet ads and are now doing just that. And now with pressure from some of the biggest global players, we're seeing them move relatively quickly, which is why we saw CTV up over 2x in Q1 in EMEA. So just very excited by the momentum. Even in the very rare cases where there's pauses or there's \u2013 I've seen some supply chains coming from Ukraine that are a little bit more affected in EMEA, the sentiment is very positive as it relates to their intentions to spend with us in the rest of the year. So I've got both of the trips in the last 4 months, more positive than when I got there and believing that what most people are doing is exactly what we described in the prepared remarks, which is when there's some economic pressure or they have to do more with less, they become very data-driven, and they become closer partners of ours during that time. And that's exactly what I'm seeing everywhere around the world and maybe as much in EMEA as anywhere else. On the political, I'll just underline what Blake said on \u2013 the seasonality is a little bit different in midterm and election than it is in the presidential election. So we expect to see more hit the second half. We also heard similar reports of just this potentially being record-setting for political on the macro. But I'll just say lastly, on the political, we \u2013 I'm really proud of what we've proven in the last couple of election cycles, which is that we can objectively represent the Democratic party as well as the Republican party that we can support a fair process and that buying in programmatic and in a data-driven way, there's room for both parties to run a better process than what they have in other mediums, including, in some cases, in social. So we're really excited about what we've proven in the past and believe that we've set ourselves up to do more for both parties and even the more independent than what we have ever done before. So excited about what that means for the second half of the year in particular. Yes. So I think your assessment sort of that's built into your question is spot on. I just \u2013 I believe the tolerance for conflict of interest among media companies and technology companies is lower than in almost any other place. So I think it's really interesting that Google decided to go to the upfronts this year. They scheduled their upfronts right on top of Disney's, of which is just sort of bad form and certainly not a way to win friends. And I think that's somewhat representative of the way they are being received among many of the media companies. So I think it's just such an amazing backdrop for us to be in the CTV space, being one of, and in many cases, the very biggest provider of ad demand for some of the biggest media companies in the world, and they're leaning into our partnerships in a way they have never before. It's just really incredible. And that's largely because they know who we are. We are very clear on the value that we provide. We are not trying to compete with them. We don't own any content. We are constantly \u2013 well, publicly and privately reassuring them that we will not own content. And we do that so that we can create a more effective supply chain, but also so that we can partner with them and just be very upfront about who we are and what we do because we think that's the best way to be competitive today. And so because we think that they are, to some extent, doing the exact same thing, they \u2013 even companies like that, that were somewhat hybrid content and technology companies have largely become a content manufacturing machine. And so it just creates opportunity for us to partner because we're all becoming very clear on who we are and what we do rather than some tech behemoth that wants to be everything, right? And Amazon competes with nearly every business and the S&P 500 at this point. And I think that becomes increasingly problematic, especially in the intersection of media and tech. You bet. So in terms of loyal signed-on users, it's actually a fairly complicated question because there is a question of how many users are signed on, but then there's also like how connected are those to sign-ins on other websites. So to sort of boil it down to what I think is the most important and easiest to explain concept, there is some amount of the Internet that needs to be logged in, in order to create the ability to model or predict what's happening on the rest of it. Instantly, this is exactly the same way that companies that use log-ins today like Google or Facebook as they're a primary identity mechanism rather than cookies. That's exactly why they're in a good position is that they'll use that and then model on some additional percentage. In general, we've seen this from some of the independent data companies. You really need only about 10% to be logged in, in order to model well on all the rest of it. I actually think that the numbers can end up being much, much higher than that in terms of what will actually be logged in and what will actually be available on UID if the trends that we predict continue. So that's the first part of your question. On the -- can you remind me the second part of your question?"

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you have seen in our results, 2022 started out strong with solid Q1 financial performance and execution despite the current macro environment. Q1 revenue was $315 million, a 43% increase and an acceleration in growth from a year ago. In Q1, we benefited from a digital advertising environment that is leaning increasingly towards data-driven advertising and measurable results. This was evidenced by the continued strength in CTV, which again led our growth from a scale channel perspective. Solimar adoption is over 80%, and we continue to see promising results as customers are utilizing Solimar to leverage more data elements than they did previously. More data-driven precision improves ROI for customers, and we believe this helps spin the flywheel of our business faster. We are also starting to see green shoots in our retail media business, with Q1 representing our first full quarter of operations in this space. We have brought on additional retail media partners into the platform and are cautiously optimistic as spend continues to ramp up. With the durable top line performance in Q1, we generated $121 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 38% of revenue. The $121 million in adjusted EBITDA represents a 72% increase from a year ago. In Q1, we continued to benefit from temporarily lower-than-expected operating expenses, partly driven by the virtual environment. Even recognizing that, I'm proud of our continued ability to consistently grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that has enabled our cash and short-term investments balance to end the quarter over the $1 billion mark for the first time. In the current environment, our demonstrated ability to invest for growth and self-fund our high-growth rates through profitable long-term cash flow generation sets us up well for the future. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin led our growth again during the quarter. For Q1, video, including CTV, represented our largest percent of share on the platform, followed by mobile. Video and mobile each represented about 40% of spend. Display continued to grow well in Q1 and represented about 15% of spend, and audio represented about 5% of spend. Geographically, North America represented 88% of spend and international represented 12% of spend. International's overall share, while relatively small for our overall business, dropped slightly from Q4 and the prior year. Historically, our growth has been driven by the strong position we have in CTV, particularly in North America. That said, our CTV business internationally continues to grab share, with European CTV spend more than doubling over the prior year in Q1. We did see a larger gap between our North American growth rate and international growth rate, particularly in the second half of Q1, mainly due to spend in Europe. However, through April, Europe has recovered to levels we saw early in Q1, although there is still some room to improve. I'm excited about our opportunities to grab share as we have proven that as our customers become more deliberate and data-driven with their ad spend, much like they did in late 2020, The Trade Desk is in a great position to help those customers and also spin our flywheel. It is still early days for us internationally, but we are optimistic about our market position and the long-term growth opportunity that we have. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, nearly all of them grew in the double digits during the quarter. Both travel and pets more than doubled compared with a year ago. Shopping and food and drink were also very strong. We believe there is still the potential for share gain and improvement in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $207 million in Q1, up 30% year-over-year. We continued to see significant operating leverage as we scale the business and improve our efficiency. Our income tax benefit of $2.7 million in the quarter was mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $105 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $146 million for Q1, and free cash flow was $136 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 88 days, down 5 days from a year ago. DPOs were 72 days, down 3 days from a year ago. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.1 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $364 million, which would represent growth of 30% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $121 million in Q2. With a large available market in front of us, we see significant opportunities ahead and continue to be motivated to invest thoughtfully in the business, placing a high importance on hiring to support future growth. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as technology, identity, supply chain optimization and customer service. I am pleased that over the past couple of years, the operating expense structure of the company has improved and is significantly better than it was prior to the pandemic. Doing so allows us to invest meaningfully in opportunities for growth while still generating strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In closing, we are excited about the momentum of our business with significant long-term growth drivers, including CTV, our international business, our retail media opportunity, which is only just beginning, our recent platform upgrade in Solimar and the upcoming U.S. midterm election cycle, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. And the strength of our business model and balance sheet have positioned us well in the current environment. I believe we have the structure in place to continue driving long-term growth while scaling our business efficiently. And I'm cautiously optimistic about continued improvement in the future. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. And Youssef, to follow up on your question on the EBITDA for Q2. Just to frame it up, I'm really happy with our situation and where we are. Like we mentioned on last quarter's call, we do expect in 2022 to increase the pace of our investment as we focus on the long-term growth of our business. And that's got a support from a very strong business model that produces strong free cash flow and has a really, really solid balance sheet. Our Q2 forecast reflects that. It includes accelerating hiring across the business, particularly in engineering, business development and account management roles that really play a huge factor in driving our long-term growth. We also expect our in-office expenses to start ramping this year to prepandemic levels. And we also anticipate hosting more employee events to get the team together. But in terms of this year, Q1 EBITDA was very strong. I'm comfortable with our EBITDA trajectory and where things stand over the remainder of the year. And like we said last quarter, we do expect the operating expense structure of the company to be better than it was prior to the pandemic. And as I've always said, this business is really built for and I'm really optimistic about driving meaningful EBITDA and free cash flow as we scale. So I think that lots of great opportunities in front of us, and I feel pretty good about it."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk, fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO; Jeff Green and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. Copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the investor relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures combined with our GAAP results provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeffrey Green: Hello, and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, I'm really excited to discuss our strong finish to the year in Q4, reflect on the progress we made in 2023, and explain why I'm so confident about our growth prospects in 2024 and beyond. Total spend on our platform in 2023 was almost $10 billion, a record for us. Revenue in the fourth quarter topped $600 million. The first time we have ever crossed that mark in a single quarter. This record spend helped drive revenue growth of 23% for the year. Once again, significantly outpacing the broader digital advertising market. And of course, we had solid growth in an uncertain market of 2022, when many of our competitors were exiting the year comparatively flat. In fact, in Q4 of 2022, we grew by 24% year-over-year. So 23% growth in 2023 on top of very strong growth in 2022 is once again leading the market. We generated adjusted EBITDA of over $770 million in 2023. We also generated $543 million of free cash flow. This relentless focus on profitability and growth allows us to keep investing in innovation, ensuring we are always bringing the best possible value to our clients, whether it's our game-changing Kokai launch or new approaches to identity and authentication for the open internet. While there is much to celebrate about 2023, I'm even more excited about 2024 and beyond. I've never felt more confident heading into a new year. I believe we are uniquely positioned to grow and gain market share, not only in 2024 but well into the future, regardless of some of the pressures that our industry is facing, whether it's cookie deprecation, growing regulatory focus on walled gardens, or the rapidly changing TV landscape. These industry shifts represent tremendous growth opportunities for us. Shifts in our nearly $1 trillion global advertising market are not dissimilar from shifts in all large markets, including the equities markets. When macro changes come to the equities markets, caused by economic velocity changes, Fed moves, or governmental changes, these sorts of macro shifts force the smart money to rotate. Or said another way, macro changes almost always force a revaluing of the market. Every investment is scrutinized and adjusted. Similarly, the Internet is being revalued once again. We've seen this many times before. During the pandemic, people streamed more. We got more inventory and the value of choice in CTV helped create better performance, so the value of CTV went up. Things shifted. We saw it again in 2021 when the Apple made changes to limit relevant advertising in its operating system, which impacted their browser and their mobile environments. We simply adjusted and we bought two segments of the ecosystem with better price discovery and performance, which were still at times inside the Apple ecosystem, but often were not. Often people looking at our massive global industry continually overlook significantly different strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for different types of companies. Some wrongly think only big companies win, and smaller companies like us don't. That paradigm is completely wrong. In general, the current shifts will help companies with authenticated users and traffic, which also sit next to large amount of advertiser demand. These macro changes hurt those, especially content owners and publishers who don't have authentication. So this year, CTV and audio have big opportunities ahead, and the rest has pockets of winners and losers. But nearly everyone will be either better off or worse off. And I believe 2024 is a year of volatility for the global advertising market. And for those who are prepared, like The Trade Desk, it is an opportunity to win share. Our platform is set up to make the most of any signal that can help advertisers drive relevance and value. Our platform now sees about 15 million advertising impression opportunities per second. And we effectively stack rank all of those impressions better than anyone else in the world based on probability of performance to any given advertiser without the bias or conflict of interest that plague most walled gardens. With UID2, Kokai, and advances in AI in our platform, we now do this more effectively than ever before. And our work in areas such as CTV, retail data, and identity are helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open internet. So, regardless of how the environment evolves around us, we will always be able to help advertisers find the right impressions for them. A great example of this is the work that we're doing with HP. They initially started to think about new approaches to identity because of the imminent cookie deprecation in Chrome. But while the conversation started there, it quickly turned to how new identifiers, such as UID2, could help manage campaigns across all channels, especially channels with high levels of user authentication. HP started using UID2 for CTV campaigns on Disney and Hulu. Disney being a notable and early adopter of UID2. HP started with their first-party data that consumers had consented to provide after making a purchase. That data was then matched with UID2s on our platform. As a result, HP segmented its audience into specific groups, allowing better targeting and measurement of specific product campaigns with more accuracy. HP was then able to link ad exposure data from UID2 identifiers with the device registration data in its CDP to connect consumers with actual online conversions and sales. That measurement proved to be more effective than the multi-touch attribution model that HP had been using, according to Caitlin Nardi, their head of programmatic for North America. This is a great example of how we're improving advertising outcomes for a major global brand by integrating new approaches to identity, authenticated audiences in high growth channels such as CTV and retail sales conversion data. It all started with a conversation about cookie deprecation, but the answer was something much more advanced, which speaks to the way that most major advertisers are innovating with us. And it's why we're embedding these innovations into Kokai. As I've said before, walled gardens are not an optimal competitive environment for the open internet. And the open internet will continue to challenge the walled gardens as the place where the very first advertising dollar is spent. Because for the most part, premium content is outside of the walled gardens, and all the questionable user-generated content is inside of the walled gardens, from cat videos to political rants to hate speech to cyber bullying. Walled gardens simply use self-reported numbers in an increasingly opaque black box. Meanwhile, retail data and premium content are making the open internet more compelling than ever. I predict this trend will accelerate during this year, which, of course, is an election year. I think it's worth spending a bulk of my time unpacking the transitions we are seeing in the industry, as it will highlight why we continue to outperform and why I'm so confident about our growth potential moving forward. To do that, I'd like to cover three main areas. First, how advertising channels such as CTV, retail media, and even digital audio are helping replumb the internet from an advertising perspective. Second, what the future of relevance in advertising looks like as the identity landscape evolves. And third, why Kokai helps us advance our growth opportunity in the context of all of this. In order to understand some of the more interesting drivers of our business, I think it's important to note the macro environment we're dealing with. For nearly all of 2023, there was uncertainty, particularly around economic growth rates and recessionary fears. In that environment, CMOs become much more reliant on their CFOs, and CFOs needed to make sure that every dollar spent was in service of growth. Which means CMOs had to focus more than ever on where they could achieve efficacy and deliver strong and provable return on ad spent. That pressure came at the same time that many CTV content owners around the world were seeing how much more valuable ad viewing subscriptions were to them than the higher priced ad free subscribers. It is not a coincidence that our growth in 2023 was driven by ongoing strength in CTV and continued leadership through strong and expanding partnerships in retail and retail media. In each of these markets, advertisers can really put data to work and drive precision because they have a greater sense of confidence and who they are actually reaching. In CTV and other emerging channels such as digital audio, there's a logged in authenticated user base. In retail media, our platform works with actual authenticated sales data. CTV continues to be the fastest growing channel at scale for The Trade Desk. There's a ton of speculation right now about the future of the TV industry, but every major TV trend is good for us. Linear is shrinking and users are streaming instead. We have built our business around streaming premium content. Subscriptions are moving to ad-funded models and both consumers and content owners want that. As the industry oscillates back and forth from fragmentation to consolidation in all scenarios, we're partnering to provide demand from the biggest advertisers in the world. But one thing is clear through all of this, ad-supported streaming is going to be an essential strategy for any successful TV provider moving forward. Nearly every major streamer has stated that they make more money from their ad-supported tiers than from their subscription only and was reported pretty extensively in recent weeks with the price of subscription models continuing to rise, consumer fatigue is settling in. There's only so much disposable entertainment money to go around. According to the Wall Street Journal, 25% of US streaming subscribers have canceled at least three subscriptions over the last two years, up from 15% for their prior two-year period. In fact, by hiking the cost of the no ad subscription services, streamers are pushing viewers to the cheaper ad-supported options, because they are more lucrative. There is only one way for the CTV ecosystem to mature. Content owners in CTV and audio get good at presenting three clear choices to consumers. Pay for access to content by seeing a few relevant ads or pay more money to avoid them or some kind of hybrid of those two. Consumers will have choice and CTV and audio will find their coveted incremental users. Some want to pay with time and some want to pay with money. There's enough pressure to fund the CTV content machines that all of them have to get focused on a light ad load with high CPMs to create the best experiences for their users. While there is more than enough pressure on TV content owners to expand relevant ad programs, there is probably even more pressure on big players of audio. 2024 will be a big year for audio, depending on the strategic choices that those players make. Just like CTV, digital audio benefits from a highly authenticated, logged in audience. Also like CTV, digital audio listeners are highly leaned in. Advertisers have a captive audience that are engaged with quality, professional content. Whether it's a podcast or your favorite music, engagement is high. And we're spending more and more time with audio streaming leaders in part because I believe they are in the very early innings of seeing the value of data driven advertising and about to set out on the journey that CTV companies began years ago. Another area of strong growth for us in the fourth quarter was retail media. Again, a major reason for this is that advertisers got to work with their first party data. In this case, real world sales data. In the fourth quarter, we saw major new shopper marketing budgets shift to The Trade Desk as more advertisers started to move from a non-decision insertion order strategy, which has long been typical in the retail space, to one that's highly decision and leveraging retail media. A great example of an advertiser leaning into retail media is Samsung in Canada. A large percentage of Samsung's device and appliance sales take place through carriers and retailers. In order to understand how advertising is influencing consumer purchases in those channels, they needed a way to unlock their first-party data and combine it with retail data. Working with their agency, Starcom, we helped Samsung develop what they call the Samsung sales measurement tool on our platform. When buyers make a purchase, they are prompted to open an account with Samsung and opt in to marketing engagement. With the right permissions, Samsung can then look back through their marketing activations across masses of consumers and start to attribute campaign activities to different stages of the purchase funnel. This helps Samsung be much more precise with their campaign activities looking forward. Working with us, they can attribute the effectiveness of marketing directly on sales 19 times more effectively than they were previously. I spend time on these growth drivers not only to give you a sense of why I'm so confident in our prospects this year, but also to underscore how major advertisers are thinking about identity and authentication. Which brings me to my second point or second topic, the evolving world of identity. I don't think it's an understatement to say that there's considerable thrash in the industry driven by Google's recent decision to accelerate the deprecation of third party cookies. It had previously been scheduled to begin deprecation at the end of March of this year, but moved up to the beginning of the year in January. I just want to be clear on one point. For all of the industry debate that's been caused by these changes, The Trade Desk stands to benefit. As I said a few minutes ago, we see approximately 15 million ad impression opportunities every second on our platform. And the vast majority of the ad impressions that we value don't have anything to do with third party cookies. When you consider the fastest growing channels of digital advertising, such as CTV or digital audio, they've never relied on cookies. Retail data doesn't rely on cookies. What our clients care about is being able to reach their audiences with precision and relevance. And we help them do that using whatever signal is available to us. And increasingly, as I've just discussed, the post-cookie world is one that will combine authentication, new approaches to identity, first-party data activation, and advanced AI-driven relevance tools, all to create a new identity fabric for the internet that is so much more effective than cookies ever were. The internet is being replunged and our product offerings create the best outcome for all of the open internet. The offerings of the walled gardens often are good for them than no one else. Let's also remember that we've seen this movie before. Today, cookies have already been deprecated for around a third of all display impressions. Browsers such as Firefox and Safari made the transition several years ago. Neither of those shifts meaningfully affected our business. In fact, quite the opposite. We continue to innovate a full range of ways for our clients to understand the relevance value of every advertising impression and price them accordingly. In fact, the value we add to advertisers and agencies has gone up with all these changes. Those shifts make it important to consider buying different impressions. And so we do. We're constantly objectively helping buyers to know where to find value and performance. As the relative value of ad shifts to somewhere else, we shift too. One example of this is the work we're doing with Unilever in Thailand. They were looking to raise awareness for their new detergent product, as well as test new identifiers that could advance addressability in a post-cookie environment. Using their own first-party data as a seed, they leveraged UID2 to target relevant audiences and measured against Unilever's traditional audience targeting methods. The results showed a marked improvement over these traditional methods, which include cookies across key areas of measurement such as click-through rate, brand awareness, and cost per completed view. Interestingly, this work relied on UID2s created from encrypted phone numbers, which is a big part of the identity fabric in Asia. This UID2 work with Unilever is now expanding into additional markets in Southeast Asia. I know you're going to ask me specifically about Privacy Sandbox, because nearly everyone else does, so I'll touch on it here. I've written fairly extensively on it on our news platform, The Current, so you can see my thoughts there in more detail. But the [Cliffs Notes] (ph) version is that I believe Google has missed an opportunity to build something better. Increased complexity with decreased functionality is hardly a compelling offering. To publishers, they are effectively saying, do more work and make less money. I believe Privacy Sandbox is an incredibly complex product, understood fully by very few people, which will likely degrade the Chrome user experience for publishers and brands, but especially for users. Users personalization will break more often. Users will begin to be required to log in seemingly everywhere. Browser-based publishers, including mobile, will likely have to do what so many e-commerce sites already do. Ask for an email address when you arrive. The consumers will get a weaker experience for a while, and publishers will make less money until they change. However, this has less impact on advertisers, especially those with quality first-party data, and it is more likely to help The Trade Desk than it is to hurt us. For many reasons, we will be better off, but a few of those to include. First, we're on the buy side. We also represent the majority of Fortune 500 brands. We also invested in UID2 many years ago. We invested in AI many years ago. And our business is increasingly built around CTV audio and environments that are almost always authenticated. Fewer cookies doesn't really matter a ton for us. It doesn't stop our work because we've been busy with other open internet pioneers building something much better. Where there is real risk is on the publisher side of the ad ecosystem, especially browser-based publishers. Others have reported that declines in publisher CPMs in Chrome, where cookies have been deprecated, are around 30%. That's potentially devastating for publishers, of course. Not so much for advertisers who continue to have millions of choices a second on where to spend their ad dollars. But this threat to publishers comes as there are daily reports of journalism outlets laying off major swaths of their newsrooms amid a really tight business climate. While there may be many reasons for the struggles that journalism outlets are having, one of the dirty secrets of the industry is that, authentication rates there are surprisingly low. That means that they don't have any sense of who is visiting their destinations, and they've been reliant on cookies until now to create relevance for advertisers. Without either cookies or publisher authentication, advertisers won't value those ad impressions nearly as much. This is a wake-up call for publishers. And the math is obvious. $1 CPM turns into $0.70 with cookie deprecation. We're often seeing $1 CPM turn into a $1.30 when UID2 is layered on it. So when publishers get to consider the contrast of $1.30 versus $0.70, the math is more obvious than ever. In some cases, they only recently started looking at the math when the dollar suddenly turned into $0.70. So 2024 has started off as a year of action for our industry. On the positive side, we're seeing more publishers lean in to single sign-on authentication tools that they control. For example, we've seen a major uptick in publishers deploying Openpath. These include Snopes, OK Magazine, Radar Online, and many others. We expect many more to deploy this in the months ahead. Openpath lets publishers authenticate their regular visitors so they can help advertisers score the relevance of their ad impression. All of this taken together brings me to my third point, our new Kokai platform. Much of what I've been talking about today is embedded into Kokai. In particular, Kokai represents a completely new way to understand and score the relevance of every ad impression across all channels. It allows advertisers to use an audience first approach to their campaigns, targeting their audiences wherever they are on the open internet. Our AI optimizations, which are now distributed across the platform, help optimize every element of the ad purchase process. Kokai is now live and similar to Nxtwave and Solomar, it will scale over the next year. It's our largest platform overhaul in our company's history and I could not be more proud of the incredible work of our product and engineering teams. In Q4, me and our product team personally visited four continents and met with hundreds of clients in each location. Europe, North America, with large showings in New York City and Chicago, as well as in Asia and Australia. After spending half a day in each location with almost a thousand clients in total, almost every single one of our clients believe that Kokai is a major upgrade to our platform and to the ecosystem. We have never launched a product with this much change and we've never launched a product with this much confidence that what we have represents a major advance in advertiser performance and that it is going to be enthusiastically adopted. So let me wrap up. I've covered a lot of ground, but there's a lot going on in our industry. And I thought it was important to reiterate why I feel so confident about our position and our prospects. In closing, I'd like to just summarize a few key points. First, agencies and brands are becoming more deliberate with their campaign budgets. They are shifting ad dollars to where they can be more data driven and precise in everything they do. And this is driving them to sign JVPs with us at a record pace. Exiting last year, over a third of our business fell under a JVP. Second, we are reinforcing our position as the ad tech AI leader. We've been embedding AI into our platform since 2016. So it's nothing new to us. But now it's being distributed across our platform so our clients can make even better choices among the 15 million ad impression opportunities the second. And understand which of those ads are most relevant to their audience segments at any given time. Third, connected TV continues to be the fastest growing channel of our business at scale and the key driver of overall omnichannel growth. And it's not just here in the US. We're seeing strong CTV growth across EMEA and Asia as more CTV inventory comes online. CTV companies are driving a ton of innovation in our industry, particularly around identity. And it's no coincidence that they have been among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of UID2. Fourth, retail media has become one of the fastest growing areas of our business, and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail partnerships and retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers think about connecting advertising to actual consumer actions. And more and more of the world's leading retailers are now active on our platform. Fifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the US over the last few years in CTV and in retail media but also in our overall go-to-market strategy. Our business outside the US grew at a much faster pace than here in the US last year. We believe we are in a position to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve. Sixth, we've seen a rapid uptick in adoption of UID2 and EUID as a new identity currency for the open Internet from advertisers, publishers, and everyone who serves them. But perhaps even more encouraging, we're seeing significant performance improvements for advertisers who are using UID2 and this is accelerating adoption. Seventh, of course, 2024 stands to be a major year for political spending here in the United States. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. This year, we expect to gain more share in this segment, and we believe that political spend will increase as the year progresses. The Trade Desk is very well positioned as the advertising industry evolves. We built our business model on the belief that objectivity and aligning our interests with buyers would matter more and more over time. Objectivity matters more now than it ever has before. And that trend will continue as walled gardens continue to grow their conflict of interest faster than ever. We are executing well. We are poised for growth. 2023 was an excellent year. We expect 2024 to be even stronger. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Laura to discuss our financials.\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff. Before I go through the details of the quarter, I want to build on Jeff's sentiments regarding the strides we've made in 2023 and emphasize the consistency in our strong execution. Over the course of 2022 and 2023, The Trade Desk delivered revenue growth over 20% every quarter, against what many would say were a challenging two years for the digital advertising industry. Whether it's our work in areas such as CTV, retail data, our platform upgrading Kokai, AI advances in our platform, or helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open internet, The Trade Desk remains resilient and we continue to execute efficiently. Now onto our results. We ended the year with a strong Q4 and our teams have carried the momentum into the start of the year. Q4 revenue was $606 million, a 23% increase year-over-year. Excluding political election spend, which was a mid-single digit percent of revenue in Q4 2022. Revenue grew 27% year-over-year. I am particularly proud of the $284 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 47%, which helped drive full year adjusted EBITDA margin to about 40% and full year free cash flow of over $540 million. Our results in both Q4 and for the full year 2023 were another example of our ability to grow our top line and gain share while simultaneously investing in our business and platform to support future growth. For 2023 we ended the year with $9.6 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.9 billion in revenue, representing 23% revenue growth. As expected, our take rate in 2023 once again remained within a very consistent historical range. We continue to execute on the model set out at the company's inception of keeping take rate consistent while substantially increasing the value that our platform provides. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry. As we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continue to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, with particularly strong growth internationally. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and more advertisers continue to utilize retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results from increased utilization of first party data. As the enhancements we've made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of spend and international represented about 12% of spend for the fourth quarter. It's worth noting, international growth again outpaced North America for the fourth quarter in a row. As I mentioned, CTV across international regions was particularly strong during the fourth quarter and throughout 2023. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $340 million, up 29% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology development, as we positioned the organization for long term growth. Income tax expense was $63 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and non-deductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $207 million, or $0.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $91 million and free cash flow was 64 million in Q4. DSOs exiting Q4 were 101 days, down three days from a year ago. DPOs were 83 days, also down three days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.4 billion in cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Finally, we repurchased $220 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program during Q4. As you have seen during our press release, today we announced new authorization under our share repurchase program of up to $700 million, which includes $53 million remaining in the existing authorization. Given the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with the consistent cash flow generation of our business model, we plan to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares and offsetting dilution from employee stock issuances. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. We estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $478 million, which would represent growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $130 million in Q1. In terms of our operating plan, we plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount efficiently. Similar to 2023, we expect to grow headcount at a rate slower than revenue growth. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage the business with a balanced perspective that allows us to wait investment opportunities while retaining flexibility for margin improvement. In closing, I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023 and our setup in 2024. We are executing to capture growth within key secular drivers like CTV and shopper marketing. We're amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPass. Our international business is poised to continue helping drive our growth. We continue to gain share within the political vertical heading into the US presidential election cycle. We're adding more value for our customers with our biggest product release ever with Kokai and we continue to innovate our platform. We enter 2024 in a strong position to grow and gain more share. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Shyam Patil with SIG. Please proceed.\nShyam Patil: Hey, guys. Great job on the quarter and the results. I just had one question. Jeff, you talked about this a little bit in your prepared remarks and Laura did as well, but could you just talk maybe a little bit more detail about how you view the state of the digital ad market today relative to how it was when you last reported your competitive positioning and how investors should be thinking about your growth in 2024? Thank you.\nJeffrey Green: Absolutely. First, Shyam, thanks so much for the question. Second, before I just jump into the answer, I just want to give a shout out to Bryce, my Chief of Staff and his wife Julie who are listening to this call right now from the hospital where they're about to induce labor for their first child. Just wanted to say, thank you for listening, thanks for all you do and wish you the very best. With that, let me jump in to answer your question. So the current ad environment is really amazing for The Trade Desk because, first of all, it is a buyer's market. So our competitive position couldn't be better because, of course, we focus on the buy side. And our buy side, while we look at 15 million ad impression opportunities every second, we're also doing that with objectivity. So the fact that we don't own any media makes it so that we can objectively figure out what to buy. And when you couple that with our technology and our client service, both are the best they've ever been and I think are pretty consistently been credited as being the best in the space. That makes it possible for us to perform like we have, which is growing over 20% every quarter for the last eight quarters. I don't think there's any scaled ad funded company or walled garden, large or small, that can state that. And then, of course, we've got all these unique tailwinds that are helping the environment, they're also helping us. The first is that, of course, CTV, the shift continues to accelerate. And there's more and more going in to ads -- I'm sorry, into ad-funded TV, where subscribers that were focused, or streamers that were focused on subscriptions that did not have ads are for the first time ever adopting ads and they're adopting them more rapidly than ever before. And I anticipate that over the next year or two, we'll see that exact same phenomenon happen in the most premium parts of audio. Then simultaneously, we have what's going on in retail media, where spend growth is also really strong. And then of course, some of the macro trends that have been making it a little harder for things to grow outside the United States are better than they've ever been, making it easier for them to grow. And we're seeing some green shoots that we didn't before in many of the markets outside the United States. And then here in the US this year is an election year. So that also brings in more political spend. There's been a lot of discussion about cookie deprecation and the future of journalism as we've just seen lots of things happening in journalism that are negative, lots of layoffs, lots of journalists being laid off. But what that's driving people towards is a realization that there needs to be a consumer-friendly opt-in for authenticated traffic so that CPMs not just stay the same but even get better. And so we're seeing just these amazing tailwinds around UID2. And then we're launching or rolling out the most sophisticated product that we've ever built. I think it's the best upgrade that we've ever made to any product that we've ever built. And as a result, we expect a strong Q1 for the same reason that we outperformed the rest of the digital advertising space for the last eight quarters. So we feel like we're in an amazing position for 2024, and we expect to continue to grow and grab market share.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Shyam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nYoussef Squali: Awesome. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the solid print. So Jeff, just as a follow up to your ads funded TV commentary, how do you think about the impact of Amazon's ad supported prime video offering on the CTV market in general and Trade Desk\u2019s growth in particular. There are fears out there that just a massive influx of CTV inventory at a lower CPM could depress CPMs across the segment without necessarily driving more demand. So just how do you think about that for the industry and for you guys in particular? Thank you.\nJeffrey Green: You bet. Thank you. So I don't think that the pool of inventory will be that massive. I do think it will be meaningful though and it will further the supply or expand the supply. But rather than that creating the huge imbalance, I do think it will just slightly tip the scale a bit more, and I would say in a way, it officially tips the scale to a buyer's market where supply does outweigh demand. But I think overall that's good for the ecosystem and it does create opportunity for us. That does mean that CTV companies will have to compete more intensely to win attention and subscribers. That does mean that their ad experience needs to be better. That means fewer ads and more relevant ads. The only way to do that is with programmatic. I believe that's part of the reason why every major streaming service that offers ads beyond their own sales team has adopted and announced partnership with UID2 and all of them are seeing higher CPMs as a result. So it does mean that the market is shaping in a way that gives more ads or more awards, more wins, if you will, to the companies that allow for UID2 to be used and allow for more relevant advertising. So to me, the way that this ends for every successful streamer is to basically run an auction that has identity attached to it, not so that they have to share any data about that impression or that user, but so that an advertiser can bring their own data about that user so that they can show a relevant ad and then the ad load can be lighter and more relevant and then that creates the optimal experience for the streaming service. I think this move by Amazon will move in that direction. What they're doing is not that unique in my view. Yes, they're adding a greater amount of inventory. But they also have a dilemma, which is that, unlike Netflix, who can raise their prices more regularly because it's attached to Amazon Prime, it makes it harder for them to do that, which means they've got to play with a different dial, which is the volume of ads. And as a result, we will see them affect in a way the more competitive nature of the landscape because they're affecting the overall supply. But again, I think that's good and accelerates the race. It will create a better experience for users and it more clearly defines what the competition is all about, which is them running an auction that includes our participation, because we largely represent the Fortune 500 and the most premium ads that you can bring into a quality streaming service. Thank you for the question.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Youssef\nOperator: The next question comes from Shweta Khajuria from Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Jeff, could you please comment on just your view or revised views? There is one on cookie deprecation. We read your blog post on The Current on this a few weeks ago. Basically, there is a healthy level of debate on the impact cookie deprecation could have on Trade Desk, especially as the year goes through. Could you please help us think through the puts and takes of that and why Trade Desk may not be as impacted or how much it would be impacted? Thanks a lot.\nJeffrey Green: You bet. Thanks, Shweta. I appreciate the question. I was hoping we would get asked this question so that we could talk about the topic. And I know there's been so much written in our space and even in the general public about cookie deprecation, but also the product that Google has launched, Privacy Sandbox. Those two things are two separate things. I think it's important to talk about them differently, even though I believe they're doing them at the same time for a reason, they are in fact two different things. So cookies are being deprecated. That does mean that it makes it a little bit harder to create personalization if you do nothing. But as a result, everybody that touches that, some will be better off and some will be worse off. And that especially is a reference to publishers. So there are many publishers that have almost 100% authentication. So almost everyone in CTV has almost 100% authentication and they are not affected by cookies. So if you look at the 15 million ad opportunities every second, and you look at the way that the dollars are divided up, a substantial amount of the dollars and the impressions that we care the most about often come from premium channels like audio and CTV and those are almost always 100% authenticated. But then there's also millions that come from other channels that are also authenticated. So those two will get a premium and those prices are going to go up. And it becomes more important that every publisher have an authentication strategy and an identity strategy. And so, more and more publishers are talking about how they adopt UID2, how they adopt our single sign-on that we've launched publicly, although it's in closed beta right now, called OpenPass. But what happens at the end of this is, we've seen from those that have reported what happens when you remove cookies is that, their CPMs go down. We've heard numbers from 30% to 50%. So if you were getting $1 before, you're getting maybe $0.50, $0.60. If you look at the reports that we've shown on what happens if you use UID2, those go from a $1 to $1.30. So in a way, this is helping publishers to see the significance of both UID2, but also the need to change. Because on that small amount of traffic that Google has taken away cookies on, they see that deprecation. It's a lot easier to compare $0.60 to $1.30 or $1.40 than it is to compare $0.60 or $0.70 to $1. So that disparity makes it more likely that publishers will actually act on that. So from our standpoint though, and this is the part that I think often people get wrong, when you're looking at 15 million ad opportunities every second, and let's just say that we have identity just to keep numbers around half of it. And if that's going to go down by 10% ish, or 10% to 15%, which represents, let's just say the exact amount of our display business, which is where cookie come from. And if it's in that 10% to 15% range, but we have some forms of authentication on a significant portion of that, you're looking at like 8%, 9% that we wouldn't have access to anymore, maybe call it 10%. Okay, well then at that 15 million instead of looking at 7 million 7.5 million, we look at 6.5 million. What does that change about our overall business? Almost nothing. So I think many have not understood that this is affecting those in the ecosystem at very different rates. And really this is a revaluing of the internet and that some sites are becoming more valuable and some are becoming less valuable. And just like anything in equities markets, when you revalue it, the people who are in charge of assigning that value or doing the buying and selling, that's an opportunity for them to add value. And this for us is an opportunity for us to add value. We are helping our buyers figure out what to buy. And I would argue we're adding more value than we ever have as a result of it. And so as a result, this is very good for us. Thank you so much for the question.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Shweta.\nOperator: Up next, we have Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Please proceed.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you, good afternoon. Jeff, thank you for the helpful color on the cookie deprecation issue. In a related topic, can you set the record straight on Privacy Sandbox? What is your view and what is Trade Desk testing there? What does it even matter to you? Because there's been some discussion in the industry press. There is some confusion, I would say. Thank you so much.\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Vasily. I appreciate the question. And as was mentioned previously, I have written fairly extensively on Privacy Sandbox on our news platform, The Current. So if anybody wants to read more details, there's also a great report by Bill Simmons, who was previously the CTO of DataZoo, which was acquired by Roku, who also had just a great POV on this, also on The Current. So as I mentioned before, there's two different things happening at roughly the same time. There is cookie deprecation, which is, Chrome is removing the use of third-party cookies, and they're doing that gradually. They introduced 1%, and that created a lot of discussion about it. But really, as an industry, so far, we -- beginning of the year, 35% of cookies were already gone because of Safari and Firefox, and now it's 36%, or something like that. So it wasn't a dramatic move, but the fear that it's going to go from 36% to 100% removal has lots of people concerned. I think it even has Google concerned who's doing this because they fear that they're taking something away and they're not replacing it with anything, Which gives their engineers a very difficult dilemma. What do we replace it with? So what they're proposing to replace it with is this product called Privacy Sandbox. Now it's a series of different APIs. There's actually more products than just Privacy Sandbox, but everyone in our industry just talks about that umbrella of APIs as Privacy Sandbox. I really believe that Google has missed an opportunity to build something better than this. They're increasing the complexity and they are deprecating at the same time. So I just, I don't think any good product ever deprecates an ecosystem and makes it more complicated at the same time. So I've been fairly critical of that. Some of us, some of our leaders, if we're going to test it, and some of our leaders have publicly said we're not going to test it. And then I publicly said we are going to test it. And the reason we're going to test it is, I just don't think you get to be a food critic if you're not willing to taste food. So yes, we've been fairly critical of it. And yes, I don't think it's a good product, but we have to try. And this may be the most iterated on product that I've ever seen from Google. So they keep changing it a lot. So it is actually hard to keep up with, but the broad strokes haven't changed a lot and the product is continually disappointed as you'll read from most op-eds outside of Google. Google says it's great, everyone else says it's not. I think it's incredibly complex. I think it's not fully understood by more than 10 people on the planet. It's really complicated. But it is not that hard to see that this is a deprecation to the internet. It is a deprecation to the Chrome user experience. And then, of course, there's lots of speculation about what Google's motives are in doing all these things at this exact moment when they're under a tremendous amount of pressure. But that's a totally different topic. But as far as our position on Privacy Sandbox, we don't think it's a good product, but we will test it, hope that it gets better. Would love for Google to innovate instead of deprecate. But in the event that they don't, it does give us a lot more traction around UID2, and The Trade Desk is going to be fine no matter what. So I'm only invested to the point that I deeply care about the open internet and would really like to see things like journalism thrive. And I am very concerned about the impact that cookies will have on things like journalism that are pretty dependent on browser-based traffic. So with that, I'll move on to the next question. Thank you for the question.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Vasily.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Salmon with New Street Research. Please proceed.\nDan Salmon: Okay. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I've got two questions. Jeff, you mentioned your single sign-on initiative, OpenPass, in the press release and your prepared remarks for the first time in recent memory. Could you talk a little bit more about that initiative? It's important to your identity and authentication strategy? And even more specifically how it works together with UID2. And then the second, just maybe for Laura on this one, but also in the prepared remarks, Jeff mentioned that JVPs now represent one-third of your business. Can you give us any more detail on how that breaks down between agencies and direct client relationships? Thank you.\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So first let me take a minute to explain where we're at with OpenPass. So first, this is in a closed invite-only beta, and you're right, we haven't talked about it a lot. There have been a number of things where people are watching us closely lately and we've been scooped or people talk about it before we get a chance to talk about it. I think this was one of them. But let me explain what it is, first of all. So if you have ever used Shopify, I think that's the easiest way to understand it. I'm a big fan of Shopify, both the company and the product itself. The first time you use Shopify, you go through a checkout process that feels just like any ordinary checkout process, you actually don't even necessarily see the value. I actually think it was brilliant that Shopify, at least the way I experienced it, never took the time to explain what they were doing. I just experienced it. That was the fastest way to get people to adopt it was to get a few merchants to do it. And then where you really see the beauty of their signup process is the second time you go to a merchant and you see Shopify there, and then you see how much faster the checkout process is. And then if you're like me, you say, how did they do that? Where did they get the information? How is it secure? And then I'm literally putting together flow charts to understand how this worked and realize that both is faster and more secure than what I had before and it was just genius. It is kind of the opposite of what I was just criticizing in Google's product and Privacy Sandbox where it complicates and deprecates. This is something that makes it both easier and more secure. And when you get both of those things together, then it's amazing. So that's exactly what we're doing with the SSO, which is we are trying to make it easier for people to sign on to websites. So the most lightweight, it's not joined with an email service. We're not launching something like Gmail. But instead, we've created this product that is OpenPass. We have a few publishers that have signed up during this invite only beta. So of course, we run it on The Current, our own product, but also on Snopes and OK Magazine and Radar Online and a few early adopters who want to try this and the results have been really fantastic. And again, where you really see the benefit is when you go to a second or third or fourth site after you've been to that first one. So we recognize that the way to get this network effect is to partner with some of the biggest companies in the world that have sign-ons and also have a desire to make the ads on their site more relevant and more competitive with more bidders than just Google. And so, we think our value proposition is really compelling, and especially once you get that flywheel spinning, then it becomes almost financially irresponsible for people not to sign up in that we can bring them higher CPM. So we're very excited about the early results. We have some big ideas about how to rapidly create adoption. And we're excited about what that represents for things like journalism, if we can get this to the scale that we want it to be. Laura, the second part of the question is for you.\nLaura Schenkein: Yeah, thanks, Dan. On the topic of JVPs, they absolutely continue to be a key driver of spend growth in our business. And as we noted, about a third of our spend was under a JVP exiting 2023. And we had, I believe exiting the year over 45 JVPs with a robust pipeline of additions to that. Those JVPs represent billions of dollars of future spend. And what gets me most excited about them is that, those JVPs are helping us get closer to our clients. And to your point, that's both brands and agencies who are signing up to do things that will drive incremental ROI for their marketing budgets. It can be anything from increasing data usage to adopting UID2 to focusing on decision [CTB] (ph) spend and I can go on and on. And the way that we look at those is that, they're effectively a win-win for The Trade Desk, they're a win-win for the agency and for the brand where they're structuring a framework that works best for their business. We don't actually break down the percent that's coming from the agency versus coming from the brand. And the main reason for that is that, even the JVPs that we're siding with our brands, we are talking to the agencies that are working hand in hand with the brand as we are structuring those JVPs. And our relationships with agencies has never been stronger. So we just constantly say, we're never losing sight of the key role that our agencies play in helping our brands execute their business. And for that reason, we don't really look at it as a breakdown, but more in terms of how can we get closer to all parties that are spending on our platform.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMatthew Cost: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. The first one is just on the conversation with advertisers. So at the time that you guided to the fourth quarter, I think you had seen at least in certain verticals some brand spend weakness through October and November, but obviously the quarter came in significantly ahead of your guidance at that time. So I guess how did the conversation evolve with advertisers? Where did you see them lean in, in ways that you didn't expect? And how has that trended through the beginning of 2024? And then the second question is just on the growth outside the US. I think there's a comment before about seeing green shoots there and continued faster growth than inside the US. I guess, are there specific ways that advertiser behavior or the inventory are changing that you would call out? Thank you.\nJeffrey Green: You bet. Thank you for the question. Just writing it down so I don't forget. So yes, in Q4 -- early in Q4, there was a little bit more, I would say, hesitation in the ecosystem, in the landscape, and I think that was not isolated to advertising. I think that was just macroeconomic angst, if you will. But of course, for the last few years, and I would just say that the angst in the CFO's office has been more closely connected to the angst in the CMO's office, really since the pandemic at a level that I haven't seen in my career. So I think there was some angst early on. And as the quarter went on, we saw some advertisers really lean in and some advertisers see some pressure. And even as we completed the quarter, it really is a tale of two cities where some companies are really driving for growth and spending aggressively to go get growth and some are watching every penny carefully and trying to be really deliberate. And that meant some spent more and some spent less. And in the end, we have an increase in spend, obviously, beyond what we guided. As it relates to outside the United States. I think a significant amount of this is caused by the same macro environment that we were just talking about. So as things change in the dollar and some of the macroeconomic policies of governments, I think that does make it easier for things outside the United States to do well. But there's also some trends in media consumption. So if you look at places like the UK or Germany, we see their CTV growth meaningfully higher than what we're experiencing in the US. And that's often because they're a year or two behind the US in terms of the competitive landscape forcing the change, the ad-funded models, and some of those types of things. But we're seeing the exact same trends play out. So in the same way that we saw those green shoots a couple years ago here in the United States, we're now starting to see them in more markets around the world and that's very good for us. So I would say it's those two things on the international or outside the US front. Thanks for the question.\nMatthew Cost: Thank you.\nChris Toth: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital. Please proceed, Matt.\nMatt Swanson: Thank you. I'll add my congratulations to you guys on the quarter and congratulations, Bryce, on his baby if you're still listening. So, Jeff, I think from the product event when we were talking about Kokai, one thing that was really intriguing to investors was this idea of being able to deliver attribution and KPIs and kind of segment it out throughout the funnel, right, not just give it all to the last click. It kind of sounded like the example you gave from Samsung. So when you've been out meeting with customers, can you just talk a little bit about like, what's exciting them the most about Kokai? What's driving adoption, and maybe how this new way of looking at attribution could kind of change spending patterns longer term?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So, first of all, thank you for the question. And there's so many things to talk about in it because there's just so many things that are inside of Kokai. So, if you don't know, and obviously I know at RBC you know this, but maybe some others on the call don't. We went on what we call a world tour at the Q4 to go to four continents and talk to our customers around the world about the product that we're launching. Honestly, I did that out of concern in the sense that I know we are giving them more change than ever, but I am confident that this is an upgrade in almost every way to our platform. And I was concerned that the amount of change would make them afraid of adopting something new simply because of how much it changed, rather than really considering all the reasons why we did it. And so, we spent a half a day on four continents. We did I think three in the United States and LA and Chicago and New York and then we also did in London and we also did it in Singapore and also did in Australia. And the reception was phenomenal. It really put to bed any concerns that I had about reluctance for adoption. We explained the reasons why we were doing everything. A big part of what they love, to answer your question about what are they most excited about, is we have streamlined our reporting. We've made it way faster. There are some reports that you just have to wait multiple minutes for it because they're just so robust. And we found ways to accelerate that. We've also added AI throughout the platform, especially in forecasting. So it's a little bit like if you were to make a hypothetical trade in a trading platform for equity, and then I'll tell you what we think is going to happen to the price action in the next 10 minutes. So we're showing them what the effects of their changes are going to be before they even make them. So that they don't make mistakes. Because sometimes what happens is, people put out a campaign, they'll put tight restrictions on it, they'll hope that it spends and they come back a day or two or even three later and then realize they made it so difficult with their combination of targeting and pricing for us to buy anything that they didn't spend much money. Or the opposite, they spend more and it wasn't as effective as they wanted. So helping them see all of that before they do anything helps. And then we put data and decisions next to each other in a better way than we ever have before. But included in those decisions are upgrades to the attribution methodologies and reporting. So we are definitely trying to do a better job of attribution, while at the same time, not adding complexity. It's a very difficult thing to do in our space. It's hard. When you want to give people more power, give them the ability to do more, usually that means you hand them more complexity. And how can we give them more power and yet not increase the number of buttons exponentially, not increase the number of -- numbers on the screen exponentially. So we think we've threaded that needle and will continue to simplify, but those are the things that they're most excited about and that's part of the reason why I go into this earnings report with so much confidence is just spending so much time with our customers over the last four months.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Pitts with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed, Brian.\nTim O'Shea: Yes. Hey, it's Tim O'Shea on for Brian. Thanks for taking my question. Look, we've spoken about the impact of cookie deprecation, but what about timing and readiness? You work with so many advertisers, all the agencies. The question is, do you believe that advertisers are ready for Google to deprecate the remaining 99% of cookies in 2024? And if they aren't ready, what needs to be done? What is being done to prepare them? And then maybe just what happens to the ad market if Google decides to deprecate right before the holidays and the US presidential election? I'm curious, is there a pause? Is there a pullback? I know that Jeff spoke about what happened when Apple made similar policy changes in the past. Thank you for taking my question.\nJeffrey Green: You bet. I love this question. Thank you very much for asking it. So of course, the answer is some are, some aren't. So, who is ready for cookie deprecation? So, I believe here at The Trade Desk, we're in a phenomenal position. As a company, a big part of our technology stack centers around what we call an identity graph. And that is incredibly robust. And that is the result of our efforts. And you will recall, we've launched UID2 before the pandemic, we launched UID before that, and all of those efforts were seen around corners and we knew that this would happen. So we're confident that we're in a fantastic position. As it relates to advertisers, some are prepared and some are not. I would say the majority are not doing as much as they can. If I were to just paint a picture of the typical advertiser, they've adopted something like Snowflake. They have been trying to take their data from 20 different silos all over their organization and they're trying to figure out how to make certain that they're respecting their relationship with the consumer. And I do want to underline, I've never met a big brand that doesn't start every one of these discussions by saying, I want to be really careful about respecting the privacy of my consumer. They want a long-term relationship with them. They want to sell soap or cheeseburgers or pizza or whatever to them over and over again and so they want to be respectful. And as they're doing that, they're trying to figure out how to bring it all together and make certain that they keep it all safe. Many as they're doing that internally are saying, we know we have to put first-party data to work, but we have to really think about the implications of what they do. And many have started to do that, and many have not finished it. There's a lot of internal meetings that have to happen, and they all have to move more quickly. The thing that's been good about all the discussions today is, it's getting everybody to move a bit more quickly and say, hey, we have to act. And so, I think that's that is super healthy. But if I were to estimate, I would say most advertisers are not as ready as they could be, but the 25% that are, are going to benefit if Google were to go faster. The side of this that I'm really worried about though, is the publisher side. Again, we don't represent publishers directly. We represent the buy side. But of course, we buy from all these publishers and we want to see an open Internet thrive. But I would say that 90% of publishers that have a meaningful amount of their traffic from browsers are not prepared at all. And so you would see a rapid revaluing and you would see some struggle come as a result of Google accelerating cookies. It could have a meaningful impact on the election in the sense that if people can't advertise on those sites effectively, then the prices would go down. And then it would change the way that they either generate content or even their ability to afford to continue to generate content on those journalistic outlets. To me, they're the ones to watch most carefully because I think they're the ones that are often hurt the most, as we've just seen so many headlines in journalism of layoffs of late. And so I do think it's really prudent to be thinking about the pace that Google is going. I think they're trying to recognize all of these implications, and they don't want to have to testify before Congress in two years about what did you do to journalism or anything like that. So as a result, like them deprecating cookies 1% at this point is a good way to get people to act. And now the important thing is for advertisers and publishers to act. And I think that's going to give tons of additional momentum to things like UID2 and OpenPass. And that's one of the many reasons why I'm just so confident about our 2024.\nChris Toth: Thanks for the question. And John, can you close out the call, please? Thanks.\nOperator: Absolutely.

            "name": "Jeffrey Green",
            "content": "Hello, and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, I'm really excited to discuss our strong finish to the year in Q4, reflect on the progress we made in 2023, and explain why I'm so confident about our growth prospects in 2024 and beyond. Total spend on our platform in 2023 was almost $10 billion, a record for us. Revenue in the fourth quarter topped $600 million. The first time we have ever crossed that mark in a single quarter. This record spend helped drive revenue growth of 23% for the year. Once again, significantly outpacing the broader digital advertising market. And of course, we had solid growth in an uncertain market of 2022, when many of our competitors were exiting the year comparatively flat. In fact, in Q4 of 2022, we grew by 24% year-over-year. So 23% growth in 2023 on top of very strong growth in 2022 is once again leading the market. We generated adjusted EBITDA of over $770 million in 2023. We also generated $543 million of free cash flow. This relentless focus on profitability and growth allows us to keep investing in innovation, ensuring we are always bringing the best possible value to our clients, whether it's our game-changing Kokai launch or new approaches to identity and authentication for the open internet. While there is much to celebrate about 2023, I'm even more excited about 2024 and beyond. I've never felt more confident heading into a new year. I believe we are uniquely positioned to grow and gain market share, not only in 2024 but well into the future, regardless of some of the pressures that our industry is facing, whether it's cookie deprecation, growing regulatory focus on walled gardens, or the rapidly changing TV landscape. These industry shifts represent tremendous growth opportunities for us. Shifts in our nearly $1 trillion global advertising market are not dissimilar from shifts in all large markets, including the equities markets. When macro changes come to the equities markets, caused by economic velocity changes, Fed moves, or governmental changes, these sorts of macro shifts force the smart money to rotate. Or said another way, macro changes almost always force a revaluing of the market. Every investment is scrutinized and adjusted. Similarly, the Internet is being revalued once again. We've seen this many times before. During the pandemic, people streamed more. We got more inventory and the value of choice in CTV helped create better performance, so the value of CTV went up. Things shifted. We saw it again in 2021 when the Apple made changes to limit relevant advertising in its operating system, which impacted their browser and their mobile environments. We simply adjusted and we bought two segments of the ecosystem with better price discovery and performance, which were still at times inside the Apple ecosystem, but often were not. Often people looking at our massive global industry continually overlook significantly different strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for different types of companies. Some wrongly think only big companies win, and smaller companies like us don't. That paradigm is completely wrong. In general, the current shifts will help companies with authenticated users and traffic, which also sit next to large amount of advertiser demand. These macro changes hurt those, especially content owners and publishers who don't have authentication. So this year, CTV and audio have big opportunities ahead, and the rest has pockets of winners and losers. But nearly everyone will be either better off or worse off. And I believe 2024 is a year of volatility for the global advertising market. And for those who are prepared, like The Trade Desk, it is an opportunity to win share. Our platform is set up to make the most of any signal that can help advertisers drive relevance and value. Our platform now sees about 15 million advertising impression opportunities per second. And we effectively stack rank all of those impressions better than anyone else in the world based on probability of performance to any given advertiser without the bias or conflict of interest that plague most walled gardens. With UID2, Kokai, and advances in AI in our platform, we now do this more effectively than ever before. And our work in areas such as CTV, retail data, and identity are helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open internet. So, regardless of how the environment evolves around us, we will always be able to help advertisers find the right impressions for them. A great example of this is the work that we're doing with HP. They initially started to think about new approaches to identity because of the imminent cookie deprecation in Chrome. But while the conversation started there, it quickly turned to how new identifiers, such as UID2, could help manage campaigns across all channels, especially channels with high levels of user authentication. HP started using UID2 for CTV campaigns on Disney and Hulu. Disney being a notable and early adopter of UID2. HP started with their first-party data that consumers had consented to provide after making a purchase. That data was then matched with UID2s on our platform. As a result, HP segmented its audience into specific groups, allowing better targeting and measurement of specific product campaigns with more accuracy. HP was then able to link ad exposure data from UID2 identifiers with the device registration data in its CDP to connect consumers with actual online conversions and sales. That measurement proved to be more effective than the multi-touch attribution model that HP had been using, according to Caitlin Nardi, their head of programmatic for North America. This is a great example of how we're improving advertising outcomes for a major global brand by integrating new approaches to identity, authenticated audiences in high growth channels such as CTV and retail sales conversion data. It all started with a conversation about cookie deprecation, but the answer was something much more advanced, which speaks to the way that most major advertisers are innovating with us. And it's why we're embedding these innovations into Kokai. As I've said before, walled gardens are not an optimal competitive environment for the open internet. And the open internet will continue to challenge the walled gardens as the place where the very first advertising dollar is spent. Because for the most part, premium content is outside of the walled gardens, and all the questionable user-generated content is inside of the walled gardens, from cat videos to political rants to hate speech to cyber bullying. Walled gardens simply use self-reported numbers in an increasingly opaque black box. Meanwhile, retail data and premium content are making the open internet more compelling than ever. I predict this trend will accelerate during this year, which, of course, is an election year. I think it's worth spending a bulk of my time unpacking the transitions we are seeing in the industry, as it will highlight why we continue to outperform and why I'm so confident about our growth potential moving forward. To do that, I'd like to cover three main areas. First, how advertising channels such as CTV, retail media, and even digital audio are helping replumb the internet from an advertising perspective. Second, what the future of relevance in advertising looks like as the identity landscape evolves. And third, why Kokai helps us advance our growth opportunity in the context of all of this. In order to understand some of the more interesting drivers of our business, I think it's important to note the macro environment we're dealing with. For nearly all of 2023, there was uncertainty, particularly around economic growth rates and recessionary fears. In that environment, CMOs become much more reliant on their CFOs, and CFOs needed to make sure that every dollar spent was in service of growth. Which means CMOs had to focus more than ever on where they could achieve efficacy and deliver strong and provable return on ad spent. That pressure came at the same time that many CTV content owners around the world were seeing how much more valuable ad viewing subscriptions were to them than the higher priced ad free subscribers. It is not a coincidence that our growth in 2023 was driven by ongoing strength in CTV and continued leadership through strong and expanding partnerships in retail and retail media. In each of these markets, advertisers can really put data to work and drive precision because they have a greater sense of confidence and who they are actually reaching. In CTV and other emerging channels such as digital audio, there's a logged in authenticated user base. In retail media, our platform works with actual authenticated sales data. CTV continues to be the fastest growing channel at scale for The Trade Desk. There's a ton of speculation right now about the future of the TV industry, but every major TV trend is good for us. Linear is shrinking and users are streaming instead. We have built our business around streaming premium content. Subscriptions are moving to ad-funded models and both consumers and content owners want that. As the industry oscillates back and forth from fragmentation to consolidation in all scenarios, we're partnering to provide demand from the biggest advertisers in the world. But one thing is clear through all of this, ad-supported streaming is going to be an essential strategy for any successful TV provider moving forward. Nearly every major streamer has stated that they make more money from their ad-supported tiers than from their subscription only and was reported pretty extensively in recent weeks with the price of subscription models continuing to rise, consumer fatigue is settling in. There's only so much disposable entertainment money to go around. According to the Wall Street Journal, 25% of US streaming subscribers have canceled at least three subscriptions over the last two years, up from 15% for their prior two-year period. In fact, by hiking the cost of the no ad subscription services, streamers are pushing viewers to the cheaper ad-supported options, because they are more lucrative. There is only one way for the CTV ecosystem to mature. Content owners in CTV and audio get good at presenting three clear choices to consumers. Pay for access to content by seeing a few relevant ads or pay more money to avoid them or some kind of hybrid of those two. Consumers will have choice and CTV and audio will find their coveted incremental users. Some want to pay with time and some want to pay with money. There's enough pressure to fund the CTV content machines that all of them have to get focused on a light ad load with high CPMs to create the best experiences for their users. While there is more than enough pressure on TV content owners to expand relevant ad programs, there is probably even more pressure on big players of audio. 2024 will be a big year for audio, depending on the strategic choices that those players make. Just like CTV, digital audio benefits from a highly authenticated, logged in audience. Also like CTV, digital audio listeners are highly leaned in. Advertisers have a captive audience that are engaged with quality, professional content. Whether it's a podcast or your favorite music, engagement is high. And we're spending more and more time with audio streaming leaders in part because I believe they are in the very early innings of seeing the value of data driven advertising and about to set out on the journey that CTV companies began years ago. Another area of strong growth for us in the fourth quarter was retail media. Again, a major reason for this is that advertisers got to work with their first party data. In this case, real world sales data. In the fourth quarter, we saw major new shopper marketing budgets shift to The Trade Desk as more advertisers started to move from a non-decision insertion order strategy, which has long been typical in the retail space, to one that's highly decision and leveraging retail media. A great example of an advertiser leaning into retail media is Samsung in Canada. A large percentage of Samsung's device and appliance sales take place through carriers and retailers. In order to understand how advertising is influencing consumer purchases in those channels, they needed a way to unlock their first-party data and combine it with retail data. Working with their agency, Starcom, we helped Samsung develop what they call the Samsung sales measurement tool on our platform. When buyers make a purchase, they are prompted to open an account with Samsung and opt in to marketing engagement. With the right permissions, Samsung can then look back through their marketing activations across masses of consumers and start to attribute campaign activities to different stages of the purchase funnel. This helps Samsung be much more precise with their campaign activities looking forward. Working with us, they can attribute the effectiveness of marketing directly on sales 19 times more effectively than they were previously. I spend time on these growth drivers not only to give you a sense of why I'm so confident in our prospects this year, but also to underscore how major advertisers are thinking about identity and authentication. Which brings me to my second point or second topic, the evolving world of identity. I don't think it's an understatement to say that there's considerable thrash in the industry driven by Google's recent decision to accelerate the deprecation of third party cookies. It had previously been scheduled to begin deprecation at the end of March of this year, but moved up to the beginning of the year in January. I just want to be clear on one point. For all of the industry debate that's been caused by these changes, The Trade Desk stands to benefit. As I said a few minutes ago, we see approximately 15 million ad impression opportunities every second on our platform. And the vast majority of the ad impressions that we value don't have anything to do with third party cookies. When you consider the fastest growing channels of digital advertising, such as CTV or digital audio, they've never relied on cookies. Retail data doesn't rely on cookies. What our clients care about is being able to reach their audiences with precision and relevance. And we help them do that using whatever signal is available to us. And increasingly, as I've just discussed, the post-cookie world is one that will combine authentication, new approaches to identity, first-party data activation, and advanced AI-driven relevance tools, all to create a new identity fabric for the internet that is so much more effective than cookies ever were. The internet is being replunged and our product offerings create the best outcome for all of the open internet. The offerings of the walled gardens often are good for them than no one else. Let's also remember that we've seen this movie before. Today, cookies have already been deprecated for around a third of all display impressions. Browsers such as Firefox and Safari made the transition several years ago. Neither of those shifts meaningfully affected our business. In fact, quite the opposite. We continue to innovate a full range of ways for our clients to understand the relevance value of every advertising impression and price them accordingly. In fact, the value we add to advertisers and agencies has gone up with all these changes. Those shifts make it important to consider buying different impressions. And so we do. We're constantly objectively helping buyers to know where to find value and performance. As the relative value of ad shifts to somewhere else, we shift too. One example of this is the work we're doing with Unilever in Thailand. They were looking to raise awareness for their new detergent product, as well as test new identifiers that could advance addressability in a post-cookie environment. Using their own first-party data as a seed, they leveraged UID2 to target relevant audiences and measured against Unilever's traditional audience targeting methods. The results showed a marked improvement over these traditional methods, which include cookies across key areas of measurement such as click-through rate, brand awareness, and cost per completed view. Interestingly, this work relied on UID2s created from encrypted phone numbers, which is a big part of the identity fabric in Asia. This UID2 work with Unilever is now expanding into additional markets in Southeast Asia. I know you're going to ask me specifically about Privacy Sandbox, because nearly everyone else does, so I'll touch on it here. I've written fairly extensively on it on our news platform, The Current, so you can see my thoughts there in more detail. But the [Cliffs Notes] (ph) version is that I believe Google has missed an opportunity to build something better. Increased complexity with decreased functionality is hardly a compelling offering. To publishers, they are effectively saying, do more work and make less money. I believe Privacy Sandbox is an incredibly complex product, understood fully by very few people, which will likely degrade the Chrome user experience for publishers and brands, but especially for users. Users personalization will break more often. Users will begin to be required to log in seemingly everywhere. Browser-based publishers, including mobile, will likely have to do what so many e-commerce sites already do. Ask for an email address when you arrive. The consumers will get a weaker experience for a while, and publishers will make less money until they change. However, this has less impact on advertisers, especially those with quality first-party data, and it is more likely to help The Trade Desk than it is to hurt us. For many reasons, we will be better off, but a few of those to include. First, we're on the buy side. We also represent the majority of Fortune 500 brands. We also invested in UID2 many years ago. We invested in AI many years ago. And our business is increasingly built around CTV audio and environments that are almost always authenticated. Fewer cookies doesn't really matter a ton for us. It doesn't stop our work because we've been busy with other open internet pioneers building something much better. Where there is real risk is on the publisher side of the ad ecosystem, especially browser-based publishers. Others have reported that declines in publisher CPMs in Chrome, where cookies have been deprecated, are around 30%. That's potentially devastating for publishers, of course. Not so much for advertisers who continue to have millions of choices a second on where to spend their ad dollars. But this threat to publishers comes as there are daily reports of journalism outlets laying off major swaths of their newsrooms amid a really tight business climate. While there may be many reasons for the struggles that journalism outlets are having, one of the dirty secrets of the industry is that, authentication rates there are surprisingly low. That means that they don't have any sense of who is visiting their destinations, and they've been reliant on cookies until now to create relevance for advertisers. Without either cookies or publisher authentication, advertisers won't value those ad impressions nearly as much. This is a wake-up call for publishers. And the math is obvious. $1 CPM turns into $0.70 with cookie deprecation. We're often seeing $1 CPM turn into a $1.30 when UID2 is layered on it. So when publishers get to consider the contrast of $1.30 versus $0.70, the math is more obvious than ever. In some cases, they only recently started looking at the math when the dollar suddenly turned into $0.70. So 2024 has started off as a year of action for our industry. On the positive side, we're seeing more publishers lean in to single sign-on authentication tools that they control. For example, we've seen a major uptick in publishers deploying Openpath. These include Snopes, OK Magazine, Radar Online, and many others. We expect many more to deploy this in the months ahead. Openpath lets publishers authenticate their regular visitors so they can help advertisers score the relevance of their ad impression. All of this taken together brings me to my third point, our new Kokai platform. Much of what I've been talking about today is embedded into Kokai. In particular, Kokai represents a completely new way to understand and score the relevance of every ad impression across all channels. It allows advertisers to use an audience first approach to their campaigns, targeting their audiences wherever they are on the open internet. Our AI optimizations, which are now distributed across the platform, help optimize every element of the ad purchase process. Kokai is now live and similar to Nxtwave and Solomar, it will scale over the next year. It's our largest platform overhaul in our company's history and I could not be more proud of the incredible work of our product and engineering teams. In Q4, me and our product team personally visited four continents and met with hundreds of clients in each location. Europe, North America, with large showings in New York City and Chicago, as well as in Asia and Australia. After spending half a day in each location with almost a thousand clients in total, almost every single one of our clients believe that Kokai is a major upgrade to our platform and to the ecosystem. We have never launched a product with this much change and we've never launched a product with this much confidence that what we have represents a major advance in advertiser performance and that it is going to be enthusiastically adopted. So let me wrap up. I've covered a lot of ground, but there's a lot going on in our industry. And I thought it was important to reiterate why I feel so confident about our position and our prospects. In closing, I'd like to just summarize a few key points. First, agencies and brands are becoming more deliberate with their campaign budgets. They are shifting ad dollars to where they can be more data driven and precise in everything they do. And this is driving them to sign JVPs with us at a record pace. Exiting last year, over a third of our business fell under a JVP. Second, we are reinforcing our position as the ad tech AI leader. We've been embedding AI into our platform since 2016. So it's nothing new to us. But now it's being distributed across our platform so our clients can make even better choices among the 15 million ad impression opportunities the second. And understand which of those ads are most relevant to their audience segments at any given time. Third, connected TV continues to be the fastest growing channel of our business at scale and the key driver of overall omnichannel growth. And it's not just here in the US. We're seeing strong CTV growth across EMEA and Asia as more CTV inventory comes online. CTV companies are driving a ton of innovation in our industry, particularly around identity. And it's no coincidence that they have been among the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of UID2. Fourth, retail media has become one of the fastest growing areas of our business, and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail partnerships and retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers think about connecting advertising to actual consumer actions. And more and more of the world's leading retailers are now active on our platform. Fifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the US over the last few years in CTV and in retail media but also in our overall go-to-market strategy. Our business outside the US grew at a much faster pace than here in the US last year. We believe we are in a position to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve. Sixth, we've seen a rapid uptick in adoption of UID2 and EUID as a new identity currency for the open Internet from advertisers, publishers, and everyone who serves them. But perhaps even more encouraging, we're seeing significant performance improvements for advertisers who are using UID2 and this is accelerating adoption. Seventh, of course, 2024 stands to be a major year for political spending here in the United States. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. This year, we expect to gain more share in this segment, and we believe that political spend will increase as the year progresses. The Trade Desk is very well positioned as the advertising industry evolves. We built our business model on the belief that objectivity and aligning our interests with buyers would matter more and more over time. Objectivity matters more now than it ever has before. And that trend will continue as walled gardens continue to grow their conflict of interest faster than ever. We are executing well. We are poised for growth. 2023 was an excellent year. We expect 2024 to be even stronger. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Laura to discuss our financials. Absolutely. First, Shyam, thanks so much for the question. Second, before I just jump into the answer, I just want to give a shout out to Bryce, my Chief of Staff and his wife Julie who are listening to this call right now from the hospital where they're about to induce labor for their first child. Just wanted to say, thank you for listening, thanks for all you do and wish you the very best. With that, let me jump in to answer your question. So the current ad environment is really amazing for The Trade Desk because, first of all, it is a buyer's market. So our competitive position couldn't be better because, of course, we focus on the buy side. And our buy side, while we look at 15 million ad impression opportunities every second, we're also doing that with objectivity. So the fact that we don't own any media makes it so that we can objectively figure out what to buy. And when you couple that with our technology and our client service, both are the best they've ever been and I think are pretty consistently been credited as being the best in the space. That makes it possible for us to perform like we have, which is growing over 20% every quarter for the last eight quarters. I don't think there's any scaled ad funded company or walled garden, large or small, that can state that. And then, of course, we've got all these unique tailwinds that are helping the environment, they're also helping us. The first is that, of course, CTV, the shift continues to accelerate. And there's more and more going in to ads -- I'm sorry, into ad-funded TV, where subscribers that were focused, or streamers that were focused on subscriptions that did not have ads are for the first time ever adopting ads and they're adopting them more rapidly than ever before. And I anticipate that over the next year or two, we'll see that exact same phenomenon happen in the most premium parts of audio. Then simultaneously, we have what's going on in retail media, where spend growth is also really strong. And then of course, some of the macro trends that have been making it a little harder for things to grow outside the United States are better than they've ever been, making it easier for them to grow. And we're seeing some green shoots that we didn't before in many of the markets outside the United States. And then here in the US this year is an election year. So that also brings in more political spend. There's been a lot of discussion about cookie deprecation and the future of journalism as we've just seen lots of things happening in journalism that are negative, lots of layoffs, lots of journalists being laid off. But what that's driving people towards is a realization that there needs to be a consumer-friendly opt-in for authenticated traffic so that CPMs not just stay the same but even get better. And so we're seeing just these amazing tailwinds around UID2. And then we're launching or rolling out the most sophisticated product that we've ever built. I think it's the best upgrade that we've ever made to any product that we've ever built. And as a result, we expect a strong Q1 for the same reason that we outperformed the rest of the digital advertising space for the last eight quarters. So we feel like we're in an amazing position for 2024, and we expect to continue to grow and grab market share. You bet. Thank you. So I don't think that the pool of inventory will be that massive. I do think it will be meaningful though and it will further the supply or expand the supply. But rather than that creating the huge imbalance, I do think it will just slightly tip the scale a bit more, and I would say in a way, it officially tips the scale to a buyer's market where supply does outweigh demand. But I think overall that's good for the ecosystem and it does create opportunity for us. That does mean that CTV companies will have to compete more intensely to win attention and subscribers. That does mean that their ad experience needs to be better. That means fewer ads and more relevant ads. The only way to do that is with programmatic. I believe that's part of the reason why every major streaming service that offers ads beyond their own sales team has adopted and announced partnership with UID2 and all of them are seeing higher CPMs as a result. So it does mean that the market is shaping in a way that gives more ads or more awards, more wins, if you will, to the companies that allow for UID2 to be used and allow for more relevant advertising. So to me, the way that this ends for every successful streamer is to basically run an auction that has identity attached to it, not so that they have to share any data about that impression or that user, but so that an advertiser can bring their own data about that user so that they can show a relevant ad and then the ad load can be lighter and more relevant and then that creates the optimal experience for the streaming service. I think this move by Amazon will move in that direction. What they're doing is not that unique in my view. Yes, they're adding a greater amount of inventory. But they also have a dilemma, which is that, unlike Netflix, who can raise their prices more regularly because it's attached to Amazon Prime, it makes it harder for them to do that, which means they've got to play with a different dial, which is the volume of ads. And as a result, we will see them affect in a way the more competitive nature of the landscape because they're affecting the overall supply. But again, I think that's good and accelerates the race. It will create a better experience for users and it more clearly defines what the competition is all about, which is them running an auction that includes our participation, because we largely represent the Fortune 500 and the most premium ads that you can bring into a quality streaming service. Thank you for the question. You bet. Thanks, Shweta. I appreciate the question. I was hoping we would get asked this question so that we could talk about the topic. And I know there's been so much written in our space and even in the general public about cookie deprecation, but also the product that Google has launched, Privacy Sandbox. Those two things are two separate things. I think it's important to talk about them differently, even though I believe they're doing them at the same time for a reason, they are in fact two different things. So cookies are being deprecated. That does mean that it makes it a little bit harder to create personalization if you do nothing. But as a result, everybody that touches that, some will be better off and some will be worse off. And that especially is a reference to publishers. So there are many publishers that have almost 100% authentication. So almost everyone in CTV has almost 100% authentication and they are not affected by cookies. So if you look at the 15 million ad opportunities every second, and you look at the way that the dollars are divided up, a substantial amount of the dollars and the impressions that we care the most about often come from premium channels like audio and CTV and those are almost always 100% authenticated. But then there's also millions that come from other channels that are also authenticated. So those two will get a premium and those prices are going to go up. And it becomes more important that every publisher have an authentication strategy and an identity strategy. And so, more and more publishers are talking about how they adopt UID2, how they adopt our single sign-on that we've launched publicly, although it's in closed beta right now, called OpenPass. But what happens at the end of this is, we've seen from those that have reported what happens when you remove cookies is that, their CPMs go down. We've heard numbers from 30% to 50%. So if you were getting $1 before, you're getting maybe $0.50, $0.60. If you look at the reports that we've shown on what happens if you use UID2, those go from a $1 to $1.30. So in a way, this is helping publishers to see the significance of both UID2, but also the need to change. Because on that small amount of traffic that Google has taken away cookies on, they see that deprecation. It's a lot easier to compare $0.60 to $1.30 or $1.40 than it is to compare $0.60 or $0.70 to $1. So that disparity makes it more likely that publishers will actually act on that. So from our standpoint though, and this is the part that I think often people get wrong, when you're looking at 15 million ad opportunities every second, and let's just say that we have identity just to keep numbers around half of it. And if that's going to go down by 10% ish, or 10% to 15%, which represents, let's just say the exact amount of our display business, which is where cookie come from. And if it's in that 10% to 15% range, but we have some forms of authentication on a significant portion of that, you're looking at like 8%, 9% that we wouldn't have access to anymore, maybe call it 10%. Okay, well then at that 15 million instead of looking at 7 million 7.5 million, we look at 6.5 million. What does that change about our overall business? Almost nothing. So I think many have not understood that this is affecting those in the ecosystem at very different rates. And really this is a revaluing of the internet and that some sites are becoming more valuable and some are becoming less valuable. And just like anything in equities markets, when you revalue it, the people who are in charge of assigning that value or doing the buying and selling, that's an opportunity for them to add value. And this for us is an opportunity for us to add value. We are helping our buyers figure out what to buy. And I would argue we're adding more value than we ever have as a result of it. And so as a result, this is very good for us. Thank you so much for the question. Thanks, Vasily. I appreciate the question. And as was mentioned previously, I have written fairly extensively on Privacy Sandbox on our news platform, The Current. So if anybody wants to read more details, there's also a great report by Bill Simmons, who was previously the CTO of DataZoo, which was acquired by Roku, who also had just a great POV on this, also on The Current. So as I mentioned before, there's two different things happening at roughly the same time. There is cookie deprecation, which is, Chrome is removing the use of third-party cookies, and they're doing that gradually. They introduced 1%, and that created a lot of discussion about it. But really, as an industry, so far, we -- beginning of the year, 35% of cookies were already gone because of Safari and Firefox, and now it's 36%, or something like that. So it wasn't a dramatic move, but the fear that it's going to go from 36% to 100% removal has lots of people concerned. I think it even has Google concerned who's doing this because they fear that they're taking something away and they're not replacing it with anything, Which gives their engineers a very difficult dilemma. What do we replace it with? So what they're proposing to replace it with is this product called Privacy Sandbox. Now it's a series of different APIs. There's actually more products than just Privacy Sandbox, but everyone in our industry just talks about that umbrella of APIs as Privacy Sandbox. I really believe that Google has missed an opportunity to build something better than this. They're increasing the complexity and they are deprecating at the same time. So I just, I don't think any good product ever deprecates an ecosystem and makes it more complicated at the same time. So I've been fairly critical of that. Some of us, some of our leaders, if we're going to test it, and some of our leaders have publicly said we're not going to test it. And then I publicly said we are going to test it. And the reason we're going to test it is, I just don't think you get to be a food critic if you're not willing to taste food. So yes, we've been fairly critical of it. And yes, I don't think it's a good product, but we have to try. And this may be the most iterated on product that I've ever seen from Google. So they keep changing it a lot. So it is actually hard to keep up with, but the broad strokes haven't changed a lot and the product is continually disappointed as you'll read from most op-eds outside of Google. Google says it's great, everyone else says it's not. I think it's incredibly complex. I think it's not fully understood by more than 10 people on the planet. It's really complicated. But it is not that hard to see that this is a deprecation to the internet. It is a deprecation to the Chrome user experience. And then, of course, there's lots of speculation about what Google's motives are in doing all these things at this exact moment when they're under a tremendous amount of pressure. But that's a totally different topic. But as far as our position on Privacy Sandbox, we don't think it's a good product, but we will test it, hope that it gets better. Would love for Google to innovate instead of deprecate. But in the event that they don't, it does give us a lot more traction around UID2, and The Trade Desk is going to be fine no matter what. So I'm only invested to the point that I deeply care about the open internet and would really like to see things like journalism thrive. And I am very concerned about the impact that cookies will have on things like journalism that are pretty dependent on browser-based traffic. So with that, I'll move on to the next question. Thank you for the question. You bet. So first let me take a minute to explain where we're at with OpenPass. So first, this is in a closed invite-only beta, and you're right, we haven't talked about it a lot. There have been a number of things where people are watching us closely lately and we've been scooped or people talk about it before we get a chance to talk about it. I think this was one of them. But let me explain what it is, first of all. So if you have ever used Shopify, I think that's the easiest way to understand it. I'm a big fan of Shopify, both the company and the product itself. The first time you use Shopify, you go through a checkout process that feels just like any ordinary checkout process, you actually don't even necessarily see the value. I actually think it was brilliant that Shopify, at least the way I experienced it, never took the time to explain what they were doing. I just experienced it. That was the fastest way to get people to adopt it was to get a few merchants to do it. And then where you really see the beauty of their signup process is the second time you go to a merchant and you see Shopify there, and then you see how much faster the checkout process is. And then if you're like me, you say, how did they do that? Where did they get the information? How is it secure? And then I'm literally putting together flow charts to understand how this worked and realize that both is faster and more secure than what I had before and it was just genius. It is kind of the opposite of what I was just criticizing in Google's product and Privacy Sandbox where it complicates and deprecates. This is something that makes it both easier and more secure. And when you get both of those things together, then it's amazing. So that's exactly what we're doing with the SSO, which is we are trying to make it easier for people to sign on to websites. So the most lightweight, it's not joined with an email service. We're not launching something like Gmail. But instead, we've created this product that is OpenPass. We have a few publishers that have signed up during this invite only beta. So of course, we run it on The Current, our own product, but also on Snopes and OK Magazine and Radar Online and a few early adopters who want to try this and the results have been really fantastic. And again, where you really see the benefit is when you go to a second or third or fourth site after you've been to that first one. So we recognize that the way to get this network effect is to partner with some of the biggest companies in the world that have sign-ons and also have a desire to make the ads on their site more relevant and more competitive with more bidders than just Google. And so, we think our value proposition is really compelling, and especially once you get that flywheel spinning, then it becomes almost financially irresponsible for people not to sign up in that we can bring them higher CPM. So we're very excited about the early results. We have some big ideas about how to rapidly create adoption. And we're excited about what that represents for things like journalism, if we can get this to the scale that we want it to be. Laura, the second part of the question is for you. You bet. Thank you for the question. Just writing it down so I don't forget. So yes, in Q4 -- early in Q4, there was a little bit more, I would say, hesitation in the ecosystem, in the landscape, and I think that was not isolated to advertising. I think that was just macroeconomic angst, if you will. But of course, for the last few years, and I would just say that the angst in the CFO's office has been more closely connected to the angst in the CMO's office, really since the pandemic at a level that I haven't seen in my career. So I think there was some angst early on. And as the quarter went on, we saw some advertisers really lean in and some advertisers see some pressure. And even as we completed the quarter, it really is a tale of two cities where some companies are really driving for growth and spending aggressively to go get growth and some are watching every penny carefully and trying to be really deliberate. And that meant some spent more and some spent less. And in the end, we have an increase in spend, obviously, beyond what we guided. As it relates to outside the United States. I think a significant amount of this is caused by the same macro environment that we were just talking about. So as things change in the dollar and some of the macroeconomic policies of governments, I think that does make it easier for things outside the United States to do well. But there's also some trends in media consumption. So if you look at places like the UK or Germany, we see their CTV growth meaningfully higher than what we're experiencing in the US. And that's often because they're a year or two behind the US in terms of the competitive landscape forcing the change, the ad-funded models, and some of those types of things. But we're seeing the exact same trends play out. So in the same way that we saw those green shoots a couple years ago here in the United States, we're now starting to see them in more markets around the world and that's very good for us. So I would say it's those two things on the international or outside the US front. Thanks for the question. You bet. So, first of all, thank you for the question. And there's so many things to talk about in it because there's just so many things that are inside of Kokai. So, if you don't know, and obviously I know at RBC you know this, but maybe some others on the call don't. We went on what we call a world tour at the Q4 to go to four continents and talk to our customers around the world about the product that we're launching. Honestly, I did that out of concern in the sense that I know we are giving them more change than ever, but I am confident that this is an upgrade in almost every way to our platform. And I was concerned that the amount of change would make them afraid of adopting something new simply because of how much it changed, rather than really considering all the reasons why we did it. And so, we spent a half a day on four continents. We did I think three in the United States and LA and Chicago and New York and then we also did in London and we also did it in Singapore and also did in Australia. And the reception was phenomenal. It really put to bed any concerns that I had about reluctance for adoption. We explained the reasons why we were doing everything. A big part of what they love, to answer your question about what are they most excited about, is we have streamlined our reporting. We've made it way faster. There are some reports that you just have to wait multiple minutes for it because they're just so robust. And we found ways to accelerate that. We've also added AI throughout the platform, especially in forecasting. So it's a little bit like if you were to make a hypothetical trade in a trading platform for equity, and then I'll tell you what we think is going to happen to the price action in the next 10 minutes. So we're showing them what the effects of their changes are going to be before they even make them. So that they don't make mistakes. Because sometimes what happens is, people put out a campaign, they'll put tight restrictions on it, they'll hope that it spends and they come back a day or two or even three later and then realize they made it so difficult with their combination of targeting and pricing for us to buy anything that they didn't spend much money. Or the opposite, they spend more and it wasn't as effective as they wanted. So helping them see all of that before they do anything helps. And then we put data and decisions next to each other in a better way than we ever have before. But included in those decisions are upgrades to the attribution methodologies and reporting. So we are definitely trying to do a better job of attribution, while at the same time, not adding complexity. It's a very difficult thing to do in our space. It's hard. When you want to give people more power, give them the ability to do more, usually that means you hand them more complexity. And how can we give them more power and yet not increase the number of buttons exponentially, not increase the number of -- numbers on the screen exponentially. So we think we've threaded that needle and will continue to simplify, but those are the things that they're most excited about and that's part of the reason why I go into this earnings report with so much confidence is just spending so much time with our customers over the last four months. You bet. I love this question. Thank you very much for asking it. So of course, the answer is some are, some aren't. So, who is ready for cookie deprecation? So, I believe here at The Trade Desk, we're in a phenomenal position. As a company, a big part of our technology stack centers around what we call an identity graph. And that is incredibly robust. And that is the result of our efforts. And you will recall, we've launched UID2 before the pandemic, we launched UID before that, and all of those efforts were seen around corners and we knew that this would happen. So we're confident that we're in a fantastic position. As it relates to advertisers, some are prepared and some are not. I would say the majority are not doing as much as they can. If I were to just paint a picture of the typical advertiser, they've adopted something like Snowflake. They have been trying to take their data from 20 different silos all over their organization and they're trying to figure out how to make certain that they're respecting their relationship with the consumer. And I do want to underline, I've never met a big brand that doesn't start every one of these discussions by saying, I want to be really careful about respecting the privacy of my consumer. They want a long-term relationship with them. They want to sell soap or cheeseburgers or pizza or whatever to them over and over again and so they want to be respectful. And as they're doing that, they're trying to figure out how to bring it all together and make certain that they keep it all safe. Many as they're doing that internally are saying, we know we have to put first-party data to work, but we have to really think about the implications of what they do. And many have started to do that, and many have not finished it. There's a lot of internal meetings that have to happen, and they all have to move more quickly. The thing that's been good about all the discussions today is, it's getting everybody to move a bit more quickly and say, hey, we have to act. And so, I think that's that is super healthy. But if I were to estimate, I would say most advertisers are not as ready as they could be, but the 25% that are, are going to benefit if Google were to go faster. The side of this that I'm really worried about though, is the publisher side. Again, we don't represent publishers directly. We represent the buy side. But of course, we buy from all these publishers and we want to see an open Internet thrive. But I would say that 90% of publishers that have a meaningful amount of their traffic from browsers are not prepared at all. And so you would see a rapid revaluing and you would see some struggle come as a result of Google accelerating cookies. It could have a meaningful impact on the election in the sense that if people can't advertise on those sites effectively, then the prices would go down. And then it would change the way that they either generate content or even their ability to afford to continue to generate content on those journalistic outlets. To me, they're the ones to watch most carefully because I think they're the ones that are often hurt the most, as we've just seen so many headlines in journalism of layoffs of late. And so I do think it's really prudent to be thinking about the pace that Google is going. I think they're trying to recognize all of these implications, and they don't want to have to testify before Congress in two years about what did you do to journalism or anything like that. So as a result, like them deprecating cookies 1% at this point is a good way to get people to act. And now the important thing is for advertisers and publishers to act. And I think that's going to give tons of additional momentum to things like UID2 and OpenPass. And that's one of the many reasons why I'm just so confident about our 2024."

            "name": "Laura Schenkein",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Before I go through the details of the quarter, I want to build on Jeff's sentiments regarding the strides we've made in 2023 and emphasize the consistency in our strong execution. Over the course of 2022 and 2023, The Trade Desk delivered revenue growth over 20% every quarter, against what many would say were a challenging two years for the digital advertising industry. Whether it's our work in areas such as CTV, retail data, our platform upgrading Kokai, AI advances in our platform, or helping build a new identity and authentication fabric for the open internet, The Trade Desk remains resilient and we continue to execute efficiently. Now onto our results. We ended the year with a strong Q4 and our teams have carried the momentum into the start of the year. Q4 revenue was $606 million, a 23% increase year-over-year. Excluding political election spend, which was a mid-single digit percent of revenue in Q4 2022. Revenue grew 27% year-over-year. I am particularly proud of the $284 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter, representing a margin of 47%, which helped drive full year adjusted EBITDA margin to about 40% and full year free cash flow of over $540 million. Our results in both Q4 and for the full year 2023 were another example of our ability to grow our top line and gain share while simultaneously investing in our business and platform to support future growth. For 2023 we ended the year with $9.6 billion in spend on our platform and about $1.9 billion in revenue, representing 23% revenue growth. As expected, our take rate in 2023 once again remained within a very consistent historical range. We continue to execute on the model set out at the company's inception of keeping take rate consistent while substantially increasing the value that our platform provides. We remain focused on our proven strategy of being the default DSP for the open internet, only representing the buy side and avoiding conflicts too often prevalent in our industry. As we continue our progression towards a total addressable market that is on track to reach $1 trillion. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected television continue to be a core driver of our business. In Q4, CTV again represented our fastest growing channel at scale around the world, with particularly strong growth internationally. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and more advertisers continue to utilize retail data in their campaigns. And we continue to see positive results from increased utilization of first party data. As the enhancements we've made throughout the year are helping deliver better outcomes for advertisers. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a high 30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of spend and international represented about 12% of spend for the fourth quarter. It's worth noting, international growth again outpaced North America for the fourth quarter in a row. As I mentioned, CTV across international regions was particularly strong during the fourth quarter and throughout 2023. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $340 million, up 29% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology development, as we positioned the organization for long term growth. Income tax expense was $63 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and non-deductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $207 million, or $0.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $91 million and free cash flow was 64 million in Q4. DSOs exiting Q4 were 101 days, down three days from a year ago. DPOs were 83 days, also down three days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.4 billion in cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Finally, we repurchased $220 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program during Q4. As you have seen during our press release, today we announced new authorization under our share repurchase program of up to $700 million, which includes $53 million remaining in the existing authorization. Given the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with the consistent cash flow generation of our business model, we plan to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares and offsetting dilution from employee stock issuances. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. We estimate Q1 revenue to be at least $478 million, which would represent growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $130 million in Q1. In terms of our operating plan, we plan to continue to invest in our business and grow headcount efficiently. Similar to 2023, we expect to grow headcount at a rate slower than revenue growth. Considering our unique ability to generate both strong top line growth and profitability, we continue to manage the business with a balanced perspective that allows us to wait investment opportunities while retaining flexibility for margin improvement. In closing, I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023 and our setup in 2024. We are executing to capture growth within key secular drivers like CTV and shopper marketing. We're amassing industry support and partnerships for UID2 and OpenPass. Our international business is poised to continue helping drive our growth. We continue to gain share within the political vertical heading into the US presidential election cycle. We're adding more value for our customers with our biggest product release ever with Kokai and we continue to innovate our platform. We enter 2024 in a strong position to grow and gain more share. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and in the years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Yeah, thanks, Dan. On the topic of JVPs, they absolutely continue to be a key driver of spend growth in our business. And as we noted, about a third of our spend was under a JVP exiting 2023. And we had, I believe exiting the year over 45 JVPs with a robust pipeline of additions to that. Those JVPs represent billions of dollars of future spend. And what gets me most excited about them is that, those JVPs are helping us get closer to our clients. And to your point, that's both brands and agencies who are signing up to do things that will drive incremental ROI for their marketing budgets. It can be anything from increasing data usage to adopting UID2 to focusing on decision [CTB] (ph) spend and I can go on and on. And the way that we look at those is that, they're effectively a win-win for The Trade Desk, they're a win-win for the agency and for the brand where they're structuring a framework that works best for their business. We don't actually break down the percent that's coming from the agency versus coming from the brand. And the main reason for that is that, even the JVPs that we're siding with our brands, we are talking to the agencies that are working hand in hand with the brand as we are structuring those JVPs. And our relationships with agencies has never been stronger. So we just constantly say, we're never losing sight of the key role that our agencies play in helping our brands execute their business. And for that reason, we don't really look at it as a breakdown, but more in terms of how can we get closer to all parties that are spending on our platform."

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Chris and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the third quarter. We reported revenue of $493 million, growing 25% compared with last year. Our third quarter again accelerated over the second quarter as we continued to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We're growing our revenues and maintaining profitability and a strong balance sheet and making large investments and, most importantly, we're gaining market share as we're outperforming our advertising peers, both big and small. From a global view, our industry is nearing the $1 trillion TAM we predicted when we launched as a public company 7 years ago. Inflation, a global pandemic, the streaming wars and retail media have all accelerated the expansion of that global TAM but it's especially accelerated the speed of the pace setter, the U.S. market. Magna Global estimates that the overall U.S. advertising industry is growing at 5% this year and digital spend or the digital ad market pie is expected to grow by 10%. Clearly, we are significantly outperforming the rest of the advertising market. This builds on our market share gains from last year when we grew 20%-plus each quarter and our competitors were posting negative to low single-digit growth. So even with a bit more uncertainty than a usual Q4, we continue to gain significant share and we are set up exceptionally well for times of relative stability. As I often share with the teams at TTD, we got here by aligning our interest with agencies and brands, the buy side. We align our interests with them and then we obsessively innovate for them. We create more value than we extract and we operate our business with a philosophy that is people-first. Our bias is to find win-win situations in all of our partnerships and our strong alignment with our customers is the foundation of our success and that foundation has created the opportunity for us to be a leader and innovator for the open Internet. 2023 has already been the biggest year of innovation in the history of The Trade Desk. And I'd like to share 6 or 7 major categories of innovation and investment. The first innovation I want to highlight today is a relatively new format for partnership. Our unmatched growth rate is fueled by signing joint business plans with major brands and agencies. JVPs represent joint innovation partnerships with our clients. Agencies and brands work closely with us to pioneer new ways of thinking about data-driven advertising and they are locking in that commitment as part of these JVPs. Our largest JVP signed this year represent future annual spend of over $1 billion per partnership. Yes, multiple partnerships have multiyear partnership agreements with omnichannel plans to spend $1 billion-plus in each of them. Our strong relationships and share gains, coupled with durable EBITDA and cash generation, means we can invest in innovation in service of our clients while also maintaining strong profitability. Our innovations in 2018 and '19 and 2020 helped us gain share during 2020 and 2021. And that's why I expect we will continue to gain share in Q4 of this year and 2024 and beyond. As a global company, in tough economic environments, we grab market share and in vibrant economic environments, we aim to lead in absolute growth. The second area of innovation I want to highlight is in AI. We've approached AI the same way we approached building the initial buying platform 14 years ago. While everyone else was on stage talking about building, we were back at the office actually building. AI has immense promise. It will change the world again. But not everyone talking about AI is delivering something real or impactful. We have been going through every part of our platform and making investments and/or plans to inject AI in the places where data sets are rich, big and high quality. Large language models, the basis of ChatGPT, aren't the highest priority places for us to make investments in AI right now. Deep learning models pointed at bidding, pricing, value and ad relevance are perfect places for us to concentrate our investment in AI. All 4 categories have private betas and some of the best engineers on the world pointed at these opportunities. We've expanded Koa, our brand for AI products that we launched in 2018 and I believe this will unlock performance budgets on our platform in the years to come. We will begin to see the impact of these 2023 AI investments in 2024. When I first mentioned the massive wave of opportunity in 2019 and 2020, one of the major factors in the size of that wave was the rapidly emerging world of CTV. As we all know, the pandemic accelerated the shift to CTV from a viewer perspective. And now we're at a point where more viewers are watching streaming services than traditional linear television. The global changes of 2020 and 2021 ushered in a period of innovation in CTV. As an industry and as a company, we crammed more advances into 2 years than might otherwise have been played out over a much longer period of time. Where once the industry was taking a wait-and-see approach to the emergence of streaming, suddenly everyone was innovating fast. Fortunately, we had a history of innovating ahead. With that same foresight, I believe the Walled Garden strategy will not work for most companies, if any, at end state. Competition, innovation and the benefits of globally integrated markets outweigh the benefits of draconian Walled Gardens. The surest way to prove the value of the open Internet is to continue to innovate in the third and fourth and fifth innovations that I want to talk about today: CTV, identity and retail media. Our innovations in CTV have fueled our outsized growth and made us a better partner for all of the content companies. The last few years, consumers and media companies have been in the new golden age of TV. Content companies have been competing for streaming subscriber growth which seemingly has provided the scoreboard determining winners and losers in the new digital era. That competition to win subscribers has ratcheted up content costs. Higher content costs mean raising prices or finding some way to raise revenue per user if media companies were going to continue to feed their content engines with a similar rate as before. Every premium video content company from Disney to Paramount to NBCU and Sky to Netflix have changed pricing and embraced advertising. Not all of them have yet embraced or centered around programmatic advertising but we predict they will. In order to get incremental subscribers, they can't simply keep raising prices. Some consumers would rather spend a few extra minutes, considering ads they watch than pay more for subscriptions. High-priced subscriptions alone will not provide the incremental subscribers media companies need to continue growing. As recently reported by Hollywood Reporter and I quote, \"Executives at every major streaming giant with both an ad-supported and an ad-free tier, including Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCU say that the total revenue per user is higher on the ad-supported plan than it is on the ad-free plan.\" Not only do media companies generate more revenue per user within an ad-supported option but the potential for growth is much greater. Ultimately, there's a limit to how much viewers will spend on subscriptions. Economic pressures on the consumer right now are increasing the appeal of a free or low-cost option that is supported by ads. However, this model is only sustainable if the ad load is significantly lower than traditional linear television. And the only way we get there is if the ads are relevant to the viewer so that the advertisers are willing to pay more for each of them. It's why we work closely with the world's largest streaming services to fully realize the value of that exchange. This includes freeing up competitive biddable inventory, advancing new approaches to identity, unleashing the power of first- and third-party data and, of course, the technology infrastructure to transact and measure. In CTV, we have innovated by constructing a more efficient supply chain by creating a new product, OpenPath. It celebrated its first birthday this year and has already become a gold standard of transparency and auction integrity. We've also advanced TV measurement with the launch of TV QI, the TV Quality Index, to showcase the value of premium TV content over UGC platforms like YouTube that advertise on more questionable content for brands. We believe the ads we show in CTV in 2023 are more relevant in CTV than they've ever been before in TV or premium video. As the value of these innovations has proven out in the CTV advertising market day after day, we continue to see more premium inventory flow into our platform. Disney, for example, just opened Disney+ inventory for us across Europe. More and more live sports inventory, perhaps the crown jewel for most streaming providers, is opening up for programmatic buying on our platform, with billions of avails every single week. For the first few weeks of the football season, for example, we are averaging more than 300 advertisers activating on the NBC Sunday Night Football live stream. A great example of an advertiser pioneering new approaches to TV advertising with a focus on live sports is Old Navy. They have been a long-time participant in the upfront process. With their agency, PhD, Old Navy wanted to embrace CTV as more of their target audience has shifted to streaming. At first, they moved part of their spend from insertion order to programmatic guaranteed and consolidated spend on our platform. In doing so, they were able to mitigate audience overlap across TV providers and hold each provider more accountable for performance. But as Old Navy quickly found out, programmatic guaranteed has limitations. Programmatic guaranteed, or PG, does not allow Old Navy to get the full value of programmatic such as frequency management, audience targeting and the ability to layer on their first-party data. So they took the next step in the form of decision biddable buying within the private marketplace and focused on live sports inventory. CTV live sports advertising was appealing because it offered an opportunity to expose their brand against very high premium content that might be more restrictive and expensive in a traditional linear environment. They were able to use Koa, The Trade Desk's AI, to optimize pacing and frequency management across the highest-performing inventory. As a result, they saw a 70% reduction in the cost to reach each unique household versus their programmatic guaranteed performance. And we're just scratching the surface. As recently reported in The Current, NBCUniversal has teamed up with the Walmart DSP which partners with The Trade Desk so brands can now deliver targeted ads on Peacock live sports inventory using Walmart shopper data. Brands can then measure and provide attribution on the results of those ads in terms of impact and in-store and online sales. So now, North America which includes brands such as Danone, Silk and Activia, reported a 30%-plus increase in new-to-brand buyers from their CTV campaign earlier this year. The next phase of innovation in CTV is the development of a forward market product on our platform. We are investing significant resources to build this product which is akin to a futures market but for premium CTV inventory. Here, we bring the best of the traditional upfront guarantee and combine it with the power of data-driven decisioning or programmatic advertising. Advertisers commit to certain levels of spend on specific audiences in a decision programmatic forward market. We are already active in live beta with a number of CTV providers and advertisers and expect the testing to steadily increase throughout 2024. We're excited to provide more details on our forward market innovations at our Forward '24 event in the first half of next year. The advances in CTV in 2023 for The Trade Desk have been accelerated by the fourth category of innovation I want to discuss today, identity. With Google's latest disclosure that they plan to deprecate cookies in 2024, the industry has been more focused than ever on coalescing around a better alternative. Nearly all of the major streaming companies in the U.S. have embraced UID2. They understand that if advertisers only advertise on users likely to be interested in their products, then advertisers will pay meaningfully more for those impressions. With UID2, content owners don't have to share data. Instead, advertisers can use their own data and to do so, they're willing to pay more. One leading streaming platform recently implemented UID2 and the results have been remarkable. Their average daily revenue from The Trade Desk has increased 150%. Their average daily revenue when those impressions are open and biddable, has increased 222% and all because they are able to offer advertisers a much clearer sense of relevance and addressability. Again, because of rising cost of content and less appetite from consumers to pay for more subscriptions, every global content company in the world is now rolling out a programmatic advertising strategy and plan. As a result, more and more publishers and advertisers are now deploying UID2. Over the last couple of years, a who's who of major publishers, advertisers and data partners have announced their commitment to UID2 and now we're seeing the positive impact of adoption on our platform. Luxury Escapes is a high-end travel agency with more than 7 million customers worldwide. They activated their first-party data on our platform and then used UID2 to help find potential new customers who shared characteristics with the most loyal customers they already had. In this way, their first-party data acted as a seed to grow their potential customer base. And the results were very impressive. In the U.S. alone, their conversion rate with UID2 was more than 400% higher than with cookies. Their return on asset was 900% higher and their cost per acquisition was 83% lower. For the first time ever, in 2024, we expect the majority of CTV and premium video impressions to be bought on our platform using either EUID or UID2. The fifth innovation I wanted to highlight today is the rapid innovating we're doing in retail media and retail data partnerships. The fusion of retail and programmatic advertising has accelerated in the wake of the pandemic. Our partnerships with Walmart, Target, Albertsons, Instacart and many, many more have fueled the expansions of our TAM in the United States. Schwartz and Ocado have been notable catalysts in the EU. Incidentally, the EU programmatic advertising ecosystem is showing signs of improvement, in part brought on by the appeal of retail partnership. And lastly, BigBasket and Tokopedia are examples of growing synergies between programmatic advertising and retail media in some of the largest APAC markets. Just as stay-at-home directives encouraged many of us to shift our viewing habits to binge streaming, they also forced many of us to shift our shopping habits to e-commerce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales boomed 43% in 2020 alone and it has continued to grow every year since. As a result, advertising on e-commerce destinations has become more attractive and the value of data collected about purchase behaviors has become much more valuable. All major retailers are working on activating that data for advertisers, so brands can understand how their advertising dollars impact actual sales, whether online or in-store and most of them are partnering with us. The significance of this shift should not go unstated. All advertisers are focused at their core on driving sales growth. But until very recently, especially in the consumer space, advertisers have been missing the link between their advertising dollars and the real-world sales growth. Instead, they have had to use proxy metrics to showcase the ROI of their campaigns. How many click-throughs did their ads strive for example. But now we can measure with much more precision whether the ad dollars actually led to a consumer purchase. We can attribute value to all parts of the funnel, not just the last touch. We can understand the relevance of every ad impression more clearly and we can better prioritize the right channel at the right time for the right audience. The open Internet is proving to be increasingly preferred by big brands as retail media makes the efficacy of the open Internet continue to improve and scale. Rossman, a major European drugstore chain, came to us when they wanted to drive first sales for their organic food brand. They knew that if consumers tried their product, there's a 95% chance of them becoming repeat customers. The challenge was getting them to make that first purchase. Working with us, they were able to deploy their first-party data and then find where their target audience groups might be across the open Internet. With data-driven precision, they were able to determine that 99% of their ad spend was hitting their specific target audience. And more major retail organizations continue to partner with us as the most effective way to enable advertisers to benefit from their data. Just last month, Instacart, one of the world's largest retail technology companies representing more than 1,400 retail labels, announced that it will make its retail media data available to advertisers on The Trade Desk. At the same time, we continue to innovate in the retail space. As a part of Kokai, we have launched the Retail Sales Index which allows advertisers to understand the performance of the retail campaigns across the open Internet. It radically simplifies the measurement and attribution process in a rapidly evolving market and we are just scratching the surface. As one of the few independent players at scale in our industry, we are in the pole position to continue partnering with leading retailers, standardize their data on our platform and drive value for our clients. Let me conclude by making a few comments about the current environment and then connect the dots of innovation and our optimism for the future. We represent the vast majority of the Ad Age top 200 advertisers, the largest advertisers in the world. Starting in the second week of October, we have seen some transitory cautiousness across some of those advertisers. These include, for example, industries that have been impacted by recent strikes such as the U.S. auto industry. Through the first week of November, we have seen spend stabilize and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year and for 2024. Both CTV and retail media continued to drive our business and we continue to win share. In terms of innovation, I am so excited to showcase the strength of this company over the next few years as we've innovated and built more this year than in any year in our history, while at the same time, preserving and leaving room to expand our operating leverage. The many innovations I've discussed today are embedded in our newest version of the platform, Kokai. We've been launching Kokai innovations throughout the year but many of the biggest innovations, including our new UX, are in alphas or private betas today and will roll out to all of our customers in the first half of next year. As we exit 2023 and look forward to 2024, I want to highlight several specific areas that make me extremely positive about our future prospects. So let me sum up. First, agencies and brands are more deliberate with advertising budgets. They are shifting ad budgets to where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven in everything they do, especially in times of uncertainty and this is driving them to sign JVPs with us at a record pace. Second is the innovation coming from AI and the many, many opportunities we have ahead of us to find places to inject AI into what may be the most rich and underappreciated data asset on the Internet which we have here at The Trade Desk. Third, Connected TV continues to be the fastest-growing channel of our business and a key driver of overall omnichannel growth and it's not just here in the U.S. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. The industry is evolving fast as providers shift inventory into biddable marketplaces to maximize ad revenue and as advertisers look to bring more precision and addressability to their TV campaigns. Fourth, retail media has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers in the CPG space think about measurement and attribution and our innovation is at the center of this. Fifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the U.S. over the last several years in our go-to-market strategy in CTV and in retail media. We believe we are in a position to continue to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve. Sixth is the rapid adoption of UID2 and EUID as the currency for relevant ads and personalized content that has been adopted by the infrastructure of the Internet and nearly all of the biggest content companies in the world. Seventh is the upcoming U.S. political election. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. In 2024, we expect to gain more share in this segment and we believe that spend will increase as the year progresses. And finally, we continue to be one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow that has steadily increased over the years. As a result, we have been able to invest in innovation and generate strong profitability. I believe The Trade Desk has been successful because we have always focused on delivering premium value to advertisers and agencies. Everything we do, including our latest Kokai innovations, are pointed at helping brands and advertisers get the maximum being for every advertising dollar. I could not be more confident or excited about how we are positioned for 2024 and beyond because of the many growth drivers that we've discussed today. We will continue to innovate to lead the market and I'm confident that the world's leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Laura, who will give you more color on the quarter.\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon. As you have seen in our Q3 results, we have continued to execute extremely well. During the quarter, we continued to grab share and outpace our peers. We delivered accelerating year-over-year revenue growth, managed our expenses efficiently and delivered strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Our results are a reflection of the premium advertisers are placing on precision, agility and transparency as they continue to shift away from linear media and walled gardens. Revenue in Q3 was $493 million, representing growth of 25% year-over-year, an acceleration from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year was about 27% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to win spend as marketers increasingly focus their investment on platforms that deliver value, particularly in premium video like CTV. This is a dynamic we've seen many times over the years. When the macro environment presents challenges, brands shift to platforms and channels that offer flexibility and measurable results. During the third quarter, CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and brought the Retail Sales Index to market. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q2 with notably strong performance in CTV. With the strong top line performance in Q3, we generated approximately $200 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 40% of revenue. This led to free cash flow of $184 million in Q3, marking over $600 million of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. I'm proud of our ability to generate strong profitability while continuing to invest in our business as that will help fund our future growth. Because of our fortunate position within an incredibly large addressable market, one of our greatest responsibilities is ensuring that we are growing sustainably while also generating sufficient profitability and cash flow. Our team has done a remarkable job achieving this as we balance short-term opportunities with our long-term financial vision. From a scale channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q3, video which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represents about 87% of our business in Q3 and international represented about 13%. We are very pleased that international growth slightly outpaced North America for the third quarter in a row. CTV across EMEA and North Asia was very strong during the quarter, growing over 100% year-over-year in each region. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, we continued to see strong performance in food and drink, travel and automotive. Health and fitness and business were below the average. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q3 were $316 million, up 29% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. Income tax expense was $18 million for the third quarter, driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and non-deductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $167 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $192 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $184 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days, down about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. In Q3, via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 1.2 million shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $90 million. We exited the third quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. First, we continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. That said, we have seen more macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of Q4. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $580 million which would represent growth of 18% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a mid-single-digit percent of spend in Q4 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q4 of this year would be about 22% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $270 million in Q4. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter and we are cautiously optimistic for Q4. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive momentum across our company priorities, achieve profitable growth and drive significant share gains. Regardless of what the macro brings, we believe we have never been in a better position than we are in today. With large growth drivers, including the ongoing secular shift to CTV, upgrading measurement with retail data, our biggest product release ever with Kokai, growth in international markets, an identity framework that has never been stronger, the U.S. presidential election cycle, amongst others, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna.\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the strong 3Q across the board. I think the big thing on everyone's mind right now is the 4Q outlook which I think caught a lot of people by surprise. Maybe we can start there. Jeff, I know you talked a little bit about this in your prepared remarks but can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in 4Q? And just what gives you confidence that it is all macro and not competitive or anything else?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. And I'm really glad you're asking this question, Shyam. So I have a lot to say on it, so I appreciate the kind words and the question. So first, just looking back, we had a very strong Q3, growing 25%, once again beating the market. And please don't forget and this is really important, that we are coming off of a 30%-plus growth year from last year, where many of our competitors were shrinking or barely growing. This year and last year were years where we're gaining market share at a higher rate than we have previously. This year, I think we signed more long-term JVPs with major brand advertisers and agencies than ever before with bigger amounts and longer time horizons than we've ever had before, too. So once again, this year, CTV and retail media have been leading the way and in general, we have amazing momentum going into Q4. Another reminder, we represent the Ad Age top 200 advertisers and of course, the majority of the S&P 500, something that I've pointed out many times before. These are, of course, the largest advertisers in the world. And of course, that means that we represent nearly every major sector of the economy as well. So that said, starting about the second week of October, we began to see some transitory cautiousness around certain advertisers. For example, we saw some reduction in brand spend in verticals such as automotive and consumer electronics, for instance, specifically around cell phones and media and entertainment. Some of these industries have been recently impacted by strikes such as the U.S. auto industry. So the first week in November, we have seen spend stabilize and we're very confident that we will continue to outpace our industry and gain market share. Excluding election spend in Q4 of 2022, we're guiding to about 22% year-over-year growth which is significantly faster than the industry and illustrates the long-term strength of our business model, especially when you consider those comps. I'm very proud of our team and what they've done in the first 3 quarters and the market wins that they're putting on the board right now. The team really is firing on all cylinders. Our company is extremely healthy with great operating leverage and a strong balance sheet. All of those things are the strongest they've ever been. Given our strength in the fastest-growing channels of digital advertising, growing long-term relationships in the world's largest brands and agencies, the technology innovations that we outlined in our prepared remarks, including Kokai and the AI investments that we're making, we are very confident that we will continue to outpace the industry and gain share and I'm very optimistic heading into 2024. Thanks, Shyam, for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannon Globe Research [ph].\nVasily Karasyov: Obviously following up on the point of interest here, Jeff, wanted to ask you to talk in a little more detail about what you saw this quarter, specifically the linearity that we've seen in the first 5 weeks so far. And probably wanted to ask about if you could provide more color on where you have seen cautiousness on the part of advertisers. So any additional color you can give us on what's going on this quarter would be appreciated.\nJeffrey Green: Okay. Laura, I know you have some comments on this. Why don't you go first, then I'll go second? I'll add to it.\nLaura Schenkein: Absolutely. Thanks, Vasily, for the question. So the way I view this is that coming off of a strong Q3, we continued to see that strength going into the first week of Q4. Starting in the second week is when we saw some advertisers become more cautious in their spend. And we saw this cautiousness across a few verticals that Jeff mentioned, such as automotive, consumer electronics and handsets and media and entertainment. And of course, some of the caution is transitory due to what we mentioned, the strikes in auto and in media and in entertainment. We continue, at the same time, to see strong spend in our largest drivers such as CTV and retail media. And through today which is a weekend change into November, we've seen spend stabilize so we're cautiously optimistic for the remainder of Q4. Jeff, is there anything you'd add to that?\nJeffrey Green: Yes. So first, a couple of things to just keep in mind. We had very strong and healthy growth every quarter for the last couple of years. We have significantly outpaced the industry and gained share. During that same time, some of our largest competitors are coming off low or negative growth from a year ago, where we're coming off of over 20% growth, then an over 20% growth again. Our unparalleled growth is because we've never been closer to many of the largest brands and agencies in the world that all use our platform. We're striking more and more long-term commitments in JVPs and we're innovating to bring new value across all their omnichannel advertising campaigns. That includes in the biggest release that we've ever made in Kokai which of course, includes AI and performance enhancements that we've never seen before. Our business is largely based on the world's largest brands. So if there is a little caution due to macro uncertainty facing everyone, we, of course, won't be immune from that in the short term. But we're convinced that the macro pressures today represent land grab opportunities now that will show fruit or pay off over and over again in the years to come. The fundamentals of our long-term business are as solid as they've ever been and we are poised to continue to outpace the industry and gain share in Q4 and we're really positioned well to go into 2024. Thanks for the question, Vasily.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\nJustin Patterson: Jeff, I just wanted to build off of your last statement there. Given the caution that you're seeing from advertisers right now, what gives you that confidence heading the next year around growth and market share gains in the year ahead? And just a quick follow-up to that point. Last year at the Analyst Day, you were talking about just investing to make sure you're not missing this CTV and retail media wave. So I know you don't guide to expenses or EBITDA for the year ahead but could you give some commentary on just how you're thinking about the right level of investments in an environment like this one?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. I'll take the first part of the question and Laura, if you'll just speak to the investment side of that question. So let me just say a few words on 2024. First, obviously, the macro environment plays a role in our business and things like higher cost of capital and increased money supply have downstream effects on most businesses. Some of those effects are opportunities which we're seeing mostly across our client base but we're seeing some of those effects as pressures on their businesses. But regardless of the macro environment's effects on individual companies, we continue to see the tidal wave of opportunity over the next 2 years. And I've never been more bullish and that is because of just the slew of things in front of us that are -- what we see as some of the biggest opportunities we've ever seen and probably ever will. CTV is moving to streaming more and more and they're also moving to biddable both as a total and as a percentage at a faster rate than it ever has before. Content has more competition than ever and it needs ads as a part of their strategies more than it ever has as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We're convinced that there are incremental subscribers and the incremental revenue are largely going to come from ads. Retail media is something we didn't spend as much time as I would have liked in the prepared remarks, is one of the fastest-growing areas of our business and it's providing advertisers with completely new ways of thinking about measurement and attribution. It closes the loop and helps them see the impact of their advertising in a way that has never been possible before. But in addition, they're also finding customers that benefit both advertisers and retailers because they're selling more of their products in the retailers that they're partnering with to get the data. In 2024, I also believe audio will follow suit. They're going to take out the CTV playbook and they're going to see some of the benefits that I think are really important for that category to grow. So I think there's another secular tailwind available in 2024. Decision programmatic is poised to have its best year ever in 2024. And I believe this is partly due to the macro pressures. We're investing heavily in our platform so that we make the value as obvious and as powerful as possible. I think the open Internet will start to get the first dollar even more in 2024 than it has in the past and the places where we're injecting AI into the platform have seen amazing results so far. So of course, I'm optimistic about what that will relate to in 2024, especially because everything that we've done so far in AI has been small and yet also really impactful. So if we just continue down that track, I think we're going to see some amazing fruit come from that. Incidentally, I'm here in Chicago today. Yesterday, I met with hundreds of our clients, hundreds of traders, hands-on keyboard people. The day before that, I met with a group about the same size in New York. We have never been more aligned with traders than we are today. I think they're excited about the control and upgrades that Kokai represent for them which I believe they'll all hit the ground running in Q1 with those enhancements. We've put better decisioning right next to data. We put those 2 right next to each other in a much better and usable way than we ever have before. We've made first-party data activation better than it's ever been before. And that's strategically more important at this moment than it's ever been. The obvious benefits of UID2 and EUID are becoming more and more apparent to everybody in the advertising community. Traders know that their jobs are not going to be taken away by AI. But instead, they have to compete with each other. So their job could be taken away from a trader who knows how to use AI really well until all of them are looking at ways to use the tools that are fueled by AI that were provided, where AI is essentially doing 1 or 2 things. It's either doing the math for them, if you will, of course, with very advanced learning models or, in other cases, it's actually their co-pilot. So we could not be more excited. I'm more bullish on even things like EUID and Europe. I think many markets outside the U.S. recovered more slowly post pandemic but we're seeing advertisers now in the EU start to really lean into the innovations that we're bringing to the market in all dimensions such as EUID. In times of macro uncertainty or for verticals that are dealing with uncertainty, we will gain share aggressively and we're seeing exactly that. In times of more stability, we accelerate our spend. But I couldn't be more confident in that model and the growth potential that, that means for both the near term and the long term. Laura, for the part on expenses?\nLaura Schenkein: Yes. So I'm going to repeat something I've said before which is that we have a great luxury. We're high growth, we're profitable. We've got cash flow. And in 2023, we're growing well into the double digits above 20%. So all of that allows us to save the course to continue investing in areas such as CTV, AI or platform measurement and to still deliver that strong profitability and cash flow. So as we and you start to think about 2024 for The Trade Desk, there are a few things I keep in mind. First, we've been deliberate in our investments in hiring. So we're going to grow headcount this year but only at about 15% to 17%. And importantly, we expect a similar trajectory next year which should allow us to grow headcount slower than revenue growth. That leads to a very nice setup for 2024. I'd also add that our investments include Kokai, AI, the forward market and we don't see any material increases as others have with investments in areas like that. We're also focusing heavily on productivity with our engineering teams, our go-to-market teams, everyone at sales, account management and trading. And I'd close with, I've been here about 10 years now and I couldn't be more confident in our model, our growth, our ability to drive profitability and cash flow in both the near and the long term. Thank you for the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI.\nShweta Khajuria: I have two, please. So first is on retail media. Jeff, when we think about the opportunity that Trade Desk has in retail media, if we think about, call it, 2 to 3 years from today, what would you be satisfied with in terms of how big retail media revenue is as a percentage of overall business, call it, 10%, 20%-plus? How should we think about that? And then second is on connected TV, clearly a growth driver as well. Where do you think industry growth is expected for next year and more specifically for Trade Desk to grow faster than overall industry? How should we think about what is really driving that inflection of shifting inventory to biddable marketplaces? Do we expect that next year and is that the key driver that will allow you to gain share?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So rather than giving specifics on growth rates that I expect 2 to 3 years from now, we don't guide in that way, I'll talk about the macro vectors that are influencing that. So what I'll be happy to see over the next 2 or 3 years is to see us, first of all, continue to grow in the way that we have with companies like Walmart and Albertsons and Walgreens and Dollar General. We've had just an amazing year in all of those partnerships and so many others. I don't mean to leave off the dozens of others that have been amazing partners to us this year. And once again, this is a case where economic pressures have helped them to be bold and daring and do things that they haven't done before that have really paid off for them and us and our clients. And I really love it when we see win-win-win situations like that. All of those are benefiting all 3 groups: the retailer, the advertiser and us, the platform. So what I look for in the next 2 to 3 years is to see that continue and to see the trends of retailers saying, \"I want to help close the loop. I want to use my data to help the biggest brands in the world sell products in my store. I want to spend my flywheel faster,\" and we want to see more and more retailers think about their business the way that Amazon thinks about their business which is about spinning the flywheel and using data to make better decisions. If they simultaneously make that data available for measurement and attribution, it will be better for everyone, including and arguably especially, them. So we want to see them do that over the next 2 to 3 years. As it relates to CTV growth, the macro trend that I just want to point out is that, of course, as there's been macro pressure put on the consumer, at the same time, we've overwhelmed the consumer with choice in the CTV world. So if you think about you as a consumer, how many more choices do you have, especially in the U.S. in streaming as compared to what you have 5 years ago. There's just way more choices. It's hard to keep track of which app the shows are even on. There's just way more choices in terms of apps and outlets. Even though there's been a little bit of lull in the content production as a result of the strikes, in terms of the apps themselves and the need for sort of this content machine to continue to grow and grow subscribers, it's gone up for all of them, whether you're talking about smaller players like Paramount or the big guys like Disney, who reported yesterday. All of them, in my view, need programmatic advertising to help them get the next stage of growth and that's largely because they can't just keep raising prices and consumers are saying, \"I want to watch it but is there any other way than having a total bill for television that is bigger than what I had back when I was paying for cable? How can I get access to all the great content and not pay quite as much?\" And what that's brought all of them to, is ad-funded options. And I think companies like Disney and Netflix have proven this, where their ad-funded subscribers are worth, in most cases, about double to them what those that are not receiving ads are worth to them. The only way that, that keeps up and that they keep producing more revenue per user is if the ads get more effective and more relevant. I don't think it's super easy for them to just create lots more ads. I think that will be too disruptive. I know there's a lot of fear of that in all the content companies. So their way out is to make CPMs go up. The only way to do that is for them to make the ads more relevant. That means they'll embrace UID2, so I -- that's already happened. All of them have offered public support. All of them are in the process of implementing. But the faster they implement UID2, the faster that will accelerate for them. And as we see more authentication and more options in terms of the way consumers can pay, it's either through sharing a little bit more of their time to see ads or paying a bit more money, we'll see more and more of them choose the ads as has historically always been the case. And as a result, that means better and bigger partnerships for us. So, I really just think we have to continue to be a great partner to the content owners and keep showing up the way that we have. But otherwise, those macro vectors are the things that are really going to drive this. Really appreciate the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Two questions. One, Jeff, that ties back to what you just talked about which is as linear shifts to CTV and to kind of upfront to programmatic solutions, right, it results in less waste. Although presumably, so some will have higher CPMs, right? But some of that spend will leave video and be allocated to some areas. Some of you participate in and like this quarter, your display accelerated, I think, a lot sequentially versus others who don't like search and social. So just maybe talk about broadly where you're helping -- you have the opportunity to help advertisers reallocate money, other places where you do participate. And then Laura, just can you talk about the swing factors that kind of go to that comment of at least for the guidance? Are you assuming that trends that have stabilized in November continue? Or does the guide kind of more assume an average, right, of like what you've seen quarter-to-date?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. I appreciate the question, Jason. Of course, I'll take the first part and then Laura, she'll take the second part. So you're right, that as money shifts from linear or traditional television into CTV, it, of course, has an opportunity to be reallocated. And whenever a CMO or a media buyer has the option to reconsider, of course, the first place where they're usually looking is to do something very similar. And let's not forget that television has always focused on being a top-of-the-funnel activity where you're creating awareness. I would argue that's where the heavy lifting of advertising is done which is the process of winning hearts and minds. Hearts and minds are not historically won in 240 blue and black characters. They are won with moving picture and audio and emotion. And that work continues to be done at the top of the funnel in CTV. So I would argue that CTV right now is the most effective television advertising that television had ever seen. And arguably, it's the most effective advertising at scale ever. So I don't anticipate that most of those dollars are moving to formats that are way different and way different location in the funnel like search or social. Those budgets are not going there. It does have -- as you point out, it does have the opportunity to leave video. But why would it when CTV is way more effective? And I would argue that the effectiveness has gone up more than the cost. And that as we see supply and demand continue, we might see more opportunities to find value as well as the target. And then, of course, as UID adoption continues to go up, the efficacy will as well. So even though I think we're doing the most effective advertising that we've ever done in television, I think there's still lots of room for exponential growth in efficacy. So when you look at all of those sort of macro trends and with the facts, I think it's inevitable that CTV gets the vast majority of that transitioning from linear and traditional and even potentially, additional spend. So Laura, your portion of that question.\nLaura Schenkein: Yes, fantastic. So in talking about the guide, what I would say is that we guide to what we see. We always have since I've been here. That includes what's been observed quarter-to-date through the 9th of November. It also includes what our team and what our clients are indicating for the rest of the year. And though I recognize that there's cautiousness in the environment, so all of that is taken into consideration. So I'm optimistic for the remainder of Q4. And we believe in this environment. It's good to listen to our customers, listen to our team and it's better to be cautious.\nOperator: The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist.\nYoussef Squali: Just one question on CTV. Jeff, can you maybe expand a little bit more on your comments around the different ways of buying CTV programmatic versus insertion orders versus programmatic guaranteed. Maybe where are we today in terms of percentage of CTV that's bought programmatically? And what is the biggest kind of hurdle to kind of get in it to become kind of the standard, the majority of the way people buy it -- interact with it?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So I would say today and these are very broad buckets. This isn't a reflection of our spend. This is me giving a commentary on the macro space. As the dollar moves over from traditional television into CTV, it's mostly gone into 3 different buckets relatively evenly. The first is to work directly with the content owner and create essentially an insertion order again. The second is to work with us through a programmatic guaranteed and then the third is to work through biddable fully decisioned programmatic. Those have roughly been equal. You're seeing the first and second converge and then the third category is, of course, the fastest growing. So when I talk about the need for television to embrace programmatic, I'm really talking about the need for it to embrace fully-decisioned programmatic because that's where content owners get higher CPMs. That's also where advertisers get the highest effectiveness and that's the only place where they're willing to pay a premium. The first and second have been increasingly converging over the last couple of years, while those were even a few years ago. More and more, they're moving towards the second and third category with the final destination really being that third category. That's how we see all of CTV moving because that's where efficacy and price and the healthiness of the ecosystem stabilizing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\nTim Nollen: Jeff, I've got a CTV question as well, please. If I heard you right, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about some OpenPath efforts already taking shape in CTV. OpenPath, you started what, 1.5 years ago, if I remember right, on -- focused on journalistic publishers. Could you just elaborate on what you were doing with OpenPath with direct relationships into CTV, please?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. I appreciate the question. So let me just remind everybody what OpenPath is. And Tim, again, really appreciate the question because I think this is something we haven't talked enough about. And you are right. OpenPath celebrated its first birthday at the beginning of this year. And it's been the fastest-growing path, if you will, or a route supply chain to inventory on our platform. And what it is, is the ability for publishers who want to do their own yield management to plug in to us directly. Where historically they would use an SSP. This time, they can plug into us directly. Part of the reason for that is because more and more companies are wanting to do their own yield management. We initially really highlighted the need for journalists or journalistic outlets to embrace this because their need for authentication as well as CPMs to go up was greater than any other part of the ecosystem. So it was really launched with journalism because that's where they needed the help the most. Where it moves the needle perhaps the most is in connected television. And the reason why it moves the needle so much in connected television is because the content ownership, unlike on the browsing web, where you have millions of websites, you only have dozens of companies in the U.S. And as I've said before, I believe television is perfectly fragmented for a business like ours. But that makes it so that they're all big enough for them to have their own yield management functions. It makes it so that we can plug in directly with them and then make certain that the option has a higher degree of integrity than if it were routed through Google or somewhere else for that matter. So we've launched OpenPath as a means of making certain that the pipes are clean and that has made certain that connected television has an ecosystem or a supply chain that is cleaner than others which is really great for CTV and its future. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Swanson: Jeff, you've talked a few times on this call about taking market share about macros and then being able to invest more aggressively in a positive. We've obviously seen in the numbers that you've taken market share over the past couple of years. Can you just talk to us when that macro does flip hopefully sooner than later, one, how do you protect those market share gains? And two, like what are those first steps when you return to investment, whether it is to protect that market share or go after new markets as the macro improves?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So implicit in the question is that, hey, when -- as the macro continues to improve, where will you make additional investments? We're investing as aggressively as we can right now. So I know we're sort of showing our operating leverage but that's not because we're saying let's flex our operating leverage. We're instead trying to grow as aggressively as we can. But as Laura highlighted in the change in headcount both this year and next year as it relates to our overall growth, that's in part because we surged our hiring during the pandemic and over the last few years so that we could capture opportunities like this one, including that we're shipping the biggest release in the history of the company this year. We started that in June. We've been releasing throughout the year. So we'll continue to make investments in that same way. But I believe those are the investments that are making it so that it's really hard for anybody to take that away from us. We spend most of our time thinking about how we compete with the biggest technology companies in the world. And the way that we compete is not to play the game the way they do. Most of them have conflict of interest all over the place and most brands are terrified to hand over their data and honestly to hand over their future to those businesses so that they're dependent on growth to come from just handing over their budgets and hoping that they get good stuff. Instead with us, they have somebody who doesn't own any media and that is a feature, not a bug, in that we help them objectively decide what media they should buy because we don't have a dog in that hunt. And by not having a conflict of interest, we help them to buy objectively across the entire media landscape, especially the most perfectly fragmented portion of that which is in CTV. The best way for us to stay ahead and I say this to our team all the time, is to do the very same things that got us here. We align our interest with our clients, we maintain our objectivity and we innovate like hell. And that's what we've been doing all this year. That's what we expect to continue to do. That becomes even easier to do from an IR standpoint as times get better and better. But we've been doing it now. We'll keep doing it in the future. That's what got us here. That's what's going to get us to the future that we know we can obtain if we just keep executing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Kuntarich with UBS.\nChris Kuntarich: Maybe one here for Laura, just going back to the guide. Can you give us a sense for how fast or if we were growing in October? And just kind of how we should be thinking about kind of what's implied potentially if it were an exit rate in December in that 18% growth where was October potentially kind of if it was growing, say, 10% in October and we're talking about a stabilization potentially around where the full year guide, could we be exiting in kind of that low 20s growth that you talked about where the guide implies where you would be for the full quarter ex political?\nLaura Schenkein: Chris, I appreciate the question. We actually aren't going to provide further guidance on exact year-over-year growth figures, both with and without election spend in the base for October, the first week of November or exiting the year. But you know correctly that we did see that drop-off in the second week of October and stabilization going into November. So all of that is factored into that guide.\nChris Kuntarich: Okay. So was -- any color, was October actually growing that you could share?\nLaura Schenkein: Of course, it was growing. I'm smiling as I say that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham.\nLaura Martin: I'll just ask one on CTV. When I talk to Disney and Paramount and Fox and they are always saying they have direct sales forces. They think they get a higher price point selling content which is not substitutable. And they're definitely afraid of the third bucket that you talk about which is -- which you think is the final destination which is biddable programmatic because they've seen what's happened in mobile and desktop and it's sort of a race to the bottom because of unlimited supply. So can you speak to the fact of why -- like, by the way, Michael Barrett yesterday on Magnite call said, he completely disagrees with you, that it's all going to stay in those first 2 buckets. So can you explain why you think the final destination is all going to be biddable when that is not what I'm hearing from my premium content owners.\nJeffrey Green: Yes. So I suppose it depends on who you ask inside of those premium content owners. But to me, the math is fairly obvious and even conceptually, it's fairly obvious. And I know that Michael Barrett's business can't really participate on the buy-side decisioning that is that third bucket. So it's natural for him to focus on the first 2 and talk about the things that are great about those 2 buckets. But if you step back, the third bucket which is fully-decisioned programmatic is the one where the advertiser gets to bring their own data to the equation, is the one where they say, \"These are the users that I want.\" It's the one where it realizes the potential of CTV advertising because the ads are relevant. Every single person here or hearing this has seen television ads that are not relevant to them. And that's driven by a system that has historically always been focused on content, where I want to match this advertiser with this content and just sort of spray and pray. That isn't what will happen in the future. That isn't what's happening in that third bucket today which is that you can bring your own data and show ads that are highly relevant so that you don't just use the show as a proxy for audience. The show was always used as proxy for audience. And sometimes, it lines up really nicely which is most people who watch football are more likely to drink beer. And so as a result, those 2 have been married really well. And that's part of the reason why ESPN content is some of the most expensive. But if you can take an ID and make certain that the ad is relevant and customize that and make it so that you're only showing ads to those that are relevant, only then can you make it so that these 4 minutes per 60 that are being used for ads which is what, 1/4 of what happens in traditional television, only then can you make the CPMs go up high enough to justify the additional cost. So long-term, we're all heading to that last bucket. It's the only place where the math makes sense. It's the only place where you really get the benefits of digital. And inside of all of those big content companies, there are groups of people that understand that, that's where we're all heading, even though not necessarily everybody gets that the traditional models of selling are not the best ways to monetize television going forward.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Laura. Operator, you can close out the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeffrey Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the third quarter. We reported revenue of $493 million, growing 25% compared with last year. Our third quarter again accelerated over the second quarter as we continued to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We're growing our revenues and maintaining profitability and a strong balance sheet and making large investments and, most importantly, we're gaining market share as we're outperforming our advertising peers, both big and small. From a global view, our industry is nearing the $1 trillion TAM we predicted when we launched as a public company 7 years ago. Inflation, a global pandemic, the streaming wars and retail media have all accelerated the expansion of that global TAM but it's especially accelerated the speed of the pace setter, the U.S. market. Magna Global estimates that the overall U.S. advertising industry is growing at 5% this year and digital spend or the digital ad market pie is expected to grow by 10%. Clearly, we are significantly outperforming the rest of the advertising market. This builds on our market share gains from last year when we grew 20%-plus each quarter and our competitors were posting negative to low single-digit growth. So even with a bit more uncertainty than a usual Q4, we continue to gain significant share and we are set up exceptionally well for times of relative stability. As I often share with the teams at TTD, we got here by aligning our interest with agencies and brands, the buy side. We align our interests with them and then we obsessively innovate for them. We create more value than we extract and we operate our business with a philosophy that is people-first. Our bias is to find win-win situations in all of our partnerships and our strong alignment with our customers is the foundation of our success and that foundation has created the opportunity for us to be a leader and innovator for the open Internet. 2023 has already been the biggest year of innovation in the history of The Trade Desk. And I'd like to share 6 or 7 major categories of innovation and investment. The first innovation I want to highlight today is a relatively new format for partnership. Our unmatched growth rate is fueled by signing joint business plans with major brands and agencies. JVPs represent joint innovation partnerships with our clients. Agencies and brands work closely with us to pioneer new ways of thinking about data-driven advertising and they are locking in that commitment as part of these JVPs. Our largest JVP signed this year represent future annual spend of over $1 billion per partnership. Yes, multiple partnerships have multiyear partnership agreements with omnichannel plans to spend $1 billion-plus in each of them. Our strong relationships and share gains, coupled with durable EBITDA and cash generation, means we can invest in innovation in service of our clients while also maintaining strong profitability. Our innovations in 2018 and '19 and 2020 helped us gain share during 2020 and 2021. And that's why I expect we will continue to gain share in Q4 of this year and 2024 and beyond. As a global company, in tough economic environments, we grab market share and in vibrant economic environments, we aim to lead in absolute growth. The second area of innovation I want to highlight is in AI. We've approached AI the same way we approached building the initial buying platform 14 years ago. While everyone else was on stage talking about building, we were back at the office actually building. AI has immense promise. It will change the world again. But not everyone talking about AI is delivering something real or impactful. We have been going through every part of our platform and making investments and/or plans to inject AI in the places where data sets are rich, big and high quality. Large language models, the basis of ChatGPT, aren't the highest priority places for us to make investments in AI right now. Deep learning models pointed at bidding, pricing, value and ad relevance are perfect places for us to concentrate our investment in AI. All 4 categories have private betas and some of the best engineers on the world pointed at these opportunities. We've expanded Koa, our brand for AI products that we launched in 2018 and I believe this will unlock performance budgets on our platform in the years to come. We will begin to see the impact of these 2023 AI investments in 2024. When I first mentioned the massive wave of opportunity in 2019 and 2020, one of the major factors in the size of that wave was the rapidly emerging world of CTV. As we all know, the pandemic accelerated the shift to CTV from a viewer perspective. And now we're at a point where more viewers are watching streaming services than traditional linear television. The global changes of 2020 and 2021 ushered in a period of innovation in CTV. As an industry and as a company, we crammed more advances into 2 years than might otherwise have been played out over a much longer period of time. Where once the industry was taking a wait-and-see approach to the emergence of streaming, suddenly everyone was innovating fast. Fortunately, we had a history of innovating ahead. With that same foresight, I believe the Walled Garden strategy will not work for most companies, if any, at end state. Competition, innovation and the benefits of globally integrated markets outweigh the benefits of draconian Walled Gardens. The surest way to prove the value of the open Internet is to continue to innovate in the third and fourth and fifth innovations that I want to talk about today: CTV, identity and retail media. Our innovations in CTV have fueled our outsized growth and made us a better partner for all of the content companies. The last few years, consumers and media companies have been in the new golden age of TV. Content companies have been competing for streaming subscriber growth which seemingly has provided the scoreboard determining winners and losers in the new digital era. That competition to win subscribers has ratcheted up content costs. Higher content costs mean raising prices or finding some way to raise revenue per user if media companies were going to continue to feed their content engines with a similar rate as before. Every premium video content company from Disney to Paramount to NBCU and Sky to Netflix have changed pricing and embraced advertising. Not all of them have yet embraced or centered around programmatic advertising but we predict they will. In order to get incremental subscribers, they can't simply keep raising prices. Some consumers would rather spend a few extra minutes, considering ads they watch than pay more for subscriptions. High-priced subscriptions alone will not provide the incremental subscribers media companies need to continue growing. As recently reported by Hollywood Reporter and I quote, \"Executives at every major streaming giant with both an ad-supported and an ad-free tier, including Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCU say that the total revenue per user is higher on the ad-supported plan than it is on the ad-free plan.\" Not only do media companies generate more revenue per user within an ad-supported option but the potential for growth is much greater. Ultimately, there's a limit to how much viewers will spend on subscriptions. Economic pressures on the consumer right now are increasing the appeal of a free or low-cost option that is supported by ads. However, this model is only sustainable if the ad load is significantly lower than traditional linear television. And the only way we get there is if the ads are relevant to the viewer so that the advertisers are willing to pay more for each of them. It's why we work closely with the world's largest streaming services to fully realize the value of that exchange. This includes freeing up competitive biddable inventory, advancing new approaches to identity, unleashing the power of first- and third-party data and, of course, the technology infrastructure to transact and measure. In CTV, we have innovated by constructing a more efficient supply chain by creating a new product, OpenPath. It celebrated its first birthday this year and has already become a gold standard of transparency and auction integrity. We've also advanced TV measurement with the launch of TV QI, the TV Quality Index, to showcase the value of premium TV content over UGC platforms like YouTube that advertise on more questionable content for brands. We believe the ads we show in CTV in 2023 are more relevant in CTV than they've ever been before in TV or premium video. As the value of these innovations has proven out in the CTV advertising market day after day, we continue to see more premium inventory flow into our platform. Disney, for example, just opened Disney+ inventory for us across Europe. More and more live sports inventory, perhaps the crown jewel for most streaming providers, is opening up for programmatic buying on our platform, with billions of avails every single week. For the first few weeks of the football season, for example, we are averaging more than 300 advertisers activating on the NBC Sunday Night Football live stream. A great example of an advertiser pioneering new approaches to TV advertising with a focus on live sports is Old Navy. They have been a long-time participant in the upfront process. With their agency, PhD, Old Navy wanted to embrace CTV as more of their target audience has shifted to streaming. At first, they moved part of their spend from insertion order to programmatic guaranteed and consolidated spend on our platform. In doing so, they were able to mitigate audience overlap across TV providers and hold each provider more accountable for performance. But as Old Navy quickly found out, programmatic guaranteed has limitations. Programmatic guaranteed, or PG, does not allow Old Navy to get the full value of programmatic such as frequency management, audience targeting and the ability to layer on their first-party data. So they took the next step in the form of decision biddable buying within the private marketplace and focused on live sports inventory. CTV live sports advertising was appealing because it offered an opportunity to expose their brand against very high premium content that might be more restrictive and expensive in a traditional linear environment. They were able to use Koa, The Trade Desk's AI, to optimize pacing and frequency management across the highest-performing inventory. As a result, they saw a 70% reduction in the cost to reach each unique household versus their programmatic guaranteed performance. And we're just scratching the surface. As recently reported in The Current, NBCUniversal has teamed up with the Walmart DSP which partners with The Trade Desk so brands can now deliver targeted ads on Peacock live sports inventory using Walmart shopper data. Brands can then measure and provide attribution on the results of those ads in terms of impact and in-store and online sales. So now, North America which includes brands such as Danone, Silk and Activia, reported a 30%-plus increase in new-to-brand buyers from their CTV campaign earlier this year. The next phase of innovation in CTV is the development of a forward market product on our platform. We are investing significant resources to build this product which is akin to a futures market but for premium CTV inventory. Here, we bring the best of the traditional upfront guarantee and combine it with the power of data-driven decisioning or programmatic advertising. Advertisers commit to certain levels of spend on specific audiences in a decision programmatic forward market. We are already active in live beta with a number of CTV providers and advertisers and expect the testing to steadily increase throughout 2024. We're excited to provide more details on our forward market innovations at our Forward '24 event in the first half of next year. The advances in CTV in 2023 for The Trade Desk have been accelerated by the fourth category of innovation I want to discuss today, identity. With Google's latest disclosure that they plan to deprecate cookies in 2024, the industry has been more focused than ever on coalescing around a better alternative. Nearly all of the major streaming companies in the U.S. have embraced UID2. They understand that if advertisers only advertise on users likely to be interested in their products, then advertisers will pay meaningfully more for those impressions. With UID2, content owners don't have to share data. Instead, advertisers can use their own data and to do so, they're willing to pay more. One leading streaming platform recently implemented UID2 and the results have been remarkable. Their average daily revenue from The Trade Desk has increased 150%. Their average daily revenue when those impressions are open and biddable, has increased 222% and all because they are able to offer advertisers a much clearer sense of relevance and addressability. Again, because of rising cost of content and less appetite from consumers to pay for more subscriptions, every global content company in the world is now rolling out a programmatic advertising strategy and plan. As a result, more and more publishers and advertisers are now deploying UID2. Over the last couple of years, a who's who of major publishers, advertisers and data partners have announced their commitment to UID2 and now we're seeing the positive impact of adoption on our platform. Luxury Escapes is a high-end travel agency with more than 7 million customers worldwide. They activated their first-party data on our platform and then used UID2 to help find potential new customers who shared characteristics with the most loyal customers they already had. In this way, their first-party data acted as a seed to grow their potential customer base. And the results were very impressive. In the U.S. alone, their conversion rate with UID2 was more than 400% higher than with cookies. Their return on asset was 900% higher and their cost per acquisition was 83% lower. For the first time ever, in 2024, we expect the majority of CTV and premium video impressions to be bought on our platform using either EUID or UID2. The fifth innovation I wanted to highlight today is the rapid innovating we're doing in retail media and retail data partnerships. The fusion of retail and programmatic advertising has accelerated in the wake of the pandemic. Our partnerships with Walmart, Target, Albertsons, Instacart and many, many more have fueled the expansions of our TAM in the United States. Schwartz and Ocado have been notable catalysts in the EU. Incidentally, the EU programmatic advertising ecosystem is showing signs of improvement, in part brought on by the appeal of retail partnership. And lastly, BigBasket and Tokopedia are examples of growing synergies between programmatic advertising and retail media in some of the largest APAC markets. Just as stay-at-home directives encouraged many of us to shift our viewing habits to binge streaming, they also forced many of us to shift our shopping habits to e-commerce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales boomed 43% in 2020 alone and it has continued to grow every year since. As a result, advertising on e-commerce destinations has become more attractive and the value of data collected about purchase behaviors has become much more valuable. All major retailers are working on activating that data for advertisers, so brands can understand how their advertising dollars impact actual sales, whether online or in-store and most of them are partnering with us. The significance of this shift should not go unstated. All advertisers are focused at their core on driving sales growth. But until very recently, especially in the consumer space, advertisers have been missing the link between their advertising dollars and the real-world sales growth. Instead, they have had to use proxy metrics to showcase the ROI of their campaigns. How many click-throughs did their ads strive for example. But now we can measure with much more precision whether the ad dollars actually led to a consumer purchase. We can attribute value to all parts of the funnel, not just the last touch. We can understand the relevance of every ad impression more clearly and we can better prioritize the right channel at the right time for the right audience. The open Internet is proving to be increasingly preferred by big brands as retail media makes the efficacy of the open Internet continue to improve and scale. Rossman, a major European drugstore chain, came to us when they wanted to drive first sales for their organic food brand. They knew that if consumers tried their product, there's a 95% chance of them becoming repeat customers. The challenge was getting them to make that first purchase. Working with us, they were able to deploy their first-party data and then find where their target audience groups might be across the open Internet. With data-driven precision, they were able to determine that 99% of their ad spend was hitting their specific target audience. And more major retail organizations continue to partner with us as the most effective way to enable advertisers to benefit from their data. Just last month, Instacart, one of the world's largest retail technology companies representing more than 1,400 retail labels, announced that it will make its retail media data available to advertisers on The Trade Desk. At the same time, we continue to innovate in the retail space. As a part of Kokai, we have launched the Retail Sales Index which allows advertisers to understand the performance of the retail campaigns across the open Internet. It radically simplifies the measurement and attribution process in a rapidly evolving market and we are just scratching the surface. As one of the few independent players at scale in our industry, we are in the pole position to continue partnering with leading retailers, standardize their data on our platform and drive value for our clients. Let me conclude by making a few comments about the current environment and then connect the dots of innovation and our optimism for the future. We represent the vast majority of the Ad Age top 200 advertisers, the largest advertisers in the world. Starting in the second week of October, we have seen some transitory cautiousness across some of those advertisers. These include, for example, industries that have been impacted by recent strikes such as the U.S. auto industry. Through the first week of November, we have seen spend stabilize and we are optimistic for the remainder of the year and for 2024. Both CTV and retail media continued to drive our business and we continue to win share. In terms of innovation, I am so excited to showcase the strength of this company over the next few years as we've innovated and built more this year than in any year in our history, while at the same time, preserving and leaving room to expand our operating leverage. The many innovations I've discussed today are embedded in our newest version of the platform, Kokai. We've been launching Kokai innovations throughout the year but many of the biggest innovations, including our new UX, are in alphas or private betas today and will roll out to all of our customers in the first half of next year. As we exit 2023 and look forward to 2024, I want to highlight several specific areas that make me extremely positive about our future prospects. So let me sum up. First, agencies and brands are more deliberate with advertising budgets. They are shifting ad budgets to where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven in everything they do, especially in times of uncertainty and this is driving them to sign JVPs with us at a record pace. Second is the innovation coming from AI and the many, many opportunities we have ahead of us to find places to inject AI into what may be the most rich and underappreciated data asset on the Internet which we have here at The Trade Desk. Third, Connected TV continues to be the fastest-growing channel of our business and a key driver of overall omnichannel growth and it's not just here in the U.S. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. The industry is evolving fast as providers shift inventory into biddable marketplaces to maximize ad revenue and as advertisers look to bring more precision and addressability to their TV campaigns. Fourth, retail media has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business and we expect this to continue in 2024. Retail media is revolutionizing the way many advertisers in the CPG space think about measurement and attribution and our innovation is at the center of this. Fifth, global expansion. We have made significant investments outside the U.S. over the last several years in our go-to-market strategy in CTV and in retail media. We believe we are in a position to continue to accelerate our international growth in many of the markets we serve. Sixth is the rapid adoption of UID2 and EUID as the currency for relevant ads and personalized content that has been adopted by the infrastructure of the Internet and nearly all of the biggest content companies in the world. Seventh is the upcoming U.S. political election. Since 2016, The Trade Desk has been a vital platform for leading political advertisers. In 2024, we expect to gain more share in this segment and we believe that spend will increase as the year progresses. And finally, we continue to be one of the few high-growth technology companies that consistently generate strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow that has steadily increased over the years. As a result, we have been able to invest in innovation and generate strong profitability. I believe The Trade Desk has been successful because we have always focused on delivering premium value to advertisers and agencies. Everything we do, including our latest Kokai innovations, are pointed at helping brands and advertisers get the maximum being for every advertising dollar. I could not be more confident or excited about how we are positioned for 2024 and beyond because of the many growth drivers that we've discussed today. We will continue to innovate to lead the market and I'm confident that the world's leading advertisers will continue to default to our platform as they seek to drive their own business growth via advertising. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Laura, who will give you more color on the quarter. You bet. And I'm really glad you're asking this question, Shyam. So I have a lot to say on it, so I appreciate the kind words and the question. So first, just looking back, we had a very strong Q3, growing 25%, once again beating the market. And please don't forget and this is really important, that we are coming off of a 30%-plus growth year from last year, where many of our competitors were shrinking or barely growing. This year and last year were years where we're gaining market share at a higher rate than we have previously. This year, I think we signed more long-term JVPs with major brand advertisers and agencies than ever before with bigger amounts and longer time horizons than we've ever had before, too. So once again, this year, CTV and retail media have been leading the way and in general, we have amazing momentum going into Q4. Another reminder, we represent the Ad Age top 200 advertisers and of course, the majority of the S&P 500, something that I've pointed out many times before. These are, of course, the largest advertisers in the world. And of course, that means that we represent nearly every major sector of the economy as well. So that said, starting about the second week of October, we began to see some transitory cautiousness around certain advertisers. For example, we saw some reduction in brand spend in verticals such as automotive and consumer electronics, for instance, specifically around cell phones and media and entertainment. Some of these industries have been recently impacted by strikes such as the U.S. auto industry. So the first week in November, we have seen spend stabilize and we're very confident that we will continue to outpace our industry and gain market share. Excluding election spend in Q4 of 2022, we're guiding to about 22% year-over-year growth which is significantly faster than the industry and illustrates the long-term strength of our business model, especially when you consider those comps. I'm very proud of our team and what they've done in the first 3 quarters and the market wins that they're putting on the board right now. The team really is firing on all cylinders. Our company is extremely healthy with great operating leverage and a strong balance sheet. All of those things are the strongest they've ever been. Given our strength in the fastest-growing channels of digital advertising, growing long-term relationships in the world's largest brands and agencies, the technology innovations that we outlined in our prepared remarks, including Kokai and the AI investments that we're making, we are very confident that we will continue to outpace the industry and gain share and I'm very optimistic heading into 2024. Thanks, Shyam, for the question. Okay. Laura, I know you have some comments on this. Why don't you go first, then I'll go second? I'll add to it. Yes. So first, a couple of things to just keep in mind. We had very strong and healthy growth every quarter for the last couple of years. We have significantly outpaced the industry and gained share. During that same time, some of our largest competitors are coming off low or negative growth from a year ago, where we're coming off of over 20% growth, then an over 20% growth again. Our unparalleled growth is because we've never been closer to many of the largest brands and agencies in the world that all use our platform. We're striking more and more long-term commitments in JVPs and we're innovating to bring new value across all their omnichannel advertising campaigns. That includes in the biggest release that we've ever made in Kokai which of course, includes AI and performance enhancements that we've never seen before. Our business is largely based on the world's largest brands. So if there is a little caution due to macro uncertainty facing everyone, we, of course, won't be immune from that in the short term. But we're convinced that the macro pressures today represent land grab opportunities now that will show fruit or pay off over and over again in the years to come. The fundamentals of our long-term business are as solid as they've ever been and we are poised to continue to outpace the industry and gain share in Q4 and we're really positioned well to go into 2024. Thanks for the question, Vasily. You bet. I'll take the first part of the question and Laura, if you'll just speak to the investment side of that question. So let me just say a few words on 2024. First, obviously, the macro environment plays a role in our business and things like higher cost of capital and increased money supply have downstream effects on most businesses. Some of those effects are opportunities which we're seeing mostly across our client base but we're seeing some of those effects as pressures on their businesses. But regardless of the macro environment's effects on individual companies, we continue to see the tidal wave of opportunity over the next 2 years. And I've never been more bullish and that is because of just the slew of things in front of us that are -- what we see as some of the biggest opportunities we've ever seen and probably ever will. CTV is moving to streaming more and more and they're also moving to biddable both as a total and as a percentage at a faster rate than it ever has before. Content has more competition than ever and it needs ads as a part of their strategies more than it ever has as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We're convinced that there are incremental subscribers and the incremental revenue are largely going to come from ads. Retail media is something we didn't spend as much time as I would have liked in the prepared remarks, is one of the fastest-growing areas of our business and it's providing advertisers with completely new ways of thinking about measurement and attribution. It closes the loop and helps them see the impact of their advertising in a way that has never been possible before. But in addition, they're also finding customers that benefit both advertisers and retailers because they're selling more of their products in the retailers that they're partnering with to get the data. In 2024, I also believe audio will follow suit. They're going to take out the CTV playbook and they're going to see some of the benefits that I think are really important for that category to grow. So I think there's another secular tailwind available in 2024. Decision programmatic is poised to have its best year ever in 2024. And I believe this is partly due to the macro pressures. We're investing heavily in our platform so that we make the value as obvious and as powerful as possible. I think the open Internet will start to get the first dollar even more in 2024 than it has in the past and the places where we're injecting AI into the platform have seen amazing results so far. So of course, I'm optimistic about what that will relate to in 2024, especially because everything that we've done so far in AI has been small and yet also really impactful. So if we just continue down that track, I think we're going to see some amazing fruit come from that. Incidentally, I'm here in Chicago today. Yesterday, I met with hundreds of our clients, hundreds of traders, hands-on keyboard people. The day before that, I met with a group about the same size in New York. We have never been more aligned with traders than we are today. I think they're excited about the control and upgrades that Kokai represent for them which I believe they'll all hit the ground running in Q1 with those enhancements. We've put better decisioning right next to data. We put those 2 right next to each other in a much better and usable way than we ever have before. We've made first-party data activation better than it's ever been before. And that's strategically more important at this moment than it's ever been. The obvious benefits of UID2 and EUID are becoming more and more apparent to everybody in the advertising community. Traders know that their jobs are not going to be taken away by AI. But instead, they have to compete with each other. So their job could be taken away from a trader who knows how to use AI really well until all of them are looking at ways to use the tools that are fueled by AI that were provided, where AI is essentially doing 1 or 2 things. It's either doing the math for them, if you will, of course, with very advanced learning models or, in other cases, it's actually their co-pilot. So we could not be more excited. I'm more bullish on even things like EUID and Europe. I think many markets outside the U.S. recovered more slowly post pandemic but we're seeing advertisers now in the EU start to really lean into the innovations that we're bringing to the market in all dimensions such as EUID. In times of macro uncertainty or for verticals that are dealing with uncertainty, we will gain share aggressively and we're seeing exactly that. In times of more stability, we accelerate our spend. But I couldn't be more confident in that model and the growth potential that, that means for both the near term and the long term. Laura, for the part on expenses? You bet. So rather than giving specifics on growth rates that I expect 2 to 3 years from now, we don't guide in that way, I'll talk about the macro vectors that are influencing that. So what I'll be happy to see over the next 2 or 3 years is to see us, first of all, continue to grow in the way that we have with companies like Walmart and Albertsons and Walgreens and Dollar General. We've had just an amazing year in all of those partnerships and so many others. I don't mean to leave off the dozens of others that have been amazing partners to us this year. And once again, this is a case where economic pressures have helped them to be bold and daring and do things that they haven't done before that have really paid off for them and us and our clients. And I really love it when we see win-win-win situations like that. All of those are benefiting all 3 groups: the retailer, the advertiser and us, the platform. So what I look for in the next 2 to 3 years is to see that continue and to see the trends of retailers saying, \"I want to help close the loop. I want to use my data to help the biggest brands in the world sell products in my store. I want to spend my flywheel faster,\" and we want to see more and more retailers think about their business the way that Amazon thinks about their business which is about spinning the flywheel and using data to make better decisions. If they simultaneously make that data available for measurement and attribution, it will be better for everyone, including and arguably especially, them. So we want to see them do that over the next 2 to 3 years. As it relates to CTV growth, the macro trend that I just want to point out is that, of course, as there's been macro pressure put on the consumer, at the same time, we've overwhelmed the consumer with choice in the CTV world. So if you think about you as a consumer, how many more choices do you have, especially in the U.S. in streaming as compared to what you have 5 years ago. There's just way more choices. It's hard to keep track of which app the shows are even on. There's just way more choices in terms of apps and outlets. Even though there's been a little bit of lull in the content production as a result of the strikes, in terms of the apps themselves and the need for sort of this content machine to continue to grow and grow subscribers, it's gone up for all of them, whether you're talking about smaller players like Paramount or the big guys like Disney, who reported yesterday. All of them, in my view, need programmatic advertising to help them get the next stage of growth and that's largely because they can't just keep raising prices and consumers are saying, \"I want to watch it but is there any other way than having a total bill for television that is bigger than what I had back when I was paying for cable? How can I get access to all the great content and not pay quite as much?\" And what that's brought all of them to, is ad-funded options. And I think companies like Disney and Netflix have proven this, where their ad-funded subscribers are worth, in most cases, about double to them what those that are not receiving ads are worth to them. The only way that, that keeps up and that they keep producing more revenue per user is if the ads get more effective and more relevant. I don't think it's super easy for them to just create lots more ads. I think that will be too disruptive. I know there's a lot of fear of that in all the content companies. So their way out is to make CPMs go up. The only way to do that is for them to make the ads more relevant. That means they'll embrace UID2, so I -- that's already happened. All of them have offered public support. All of them are in the process of implementing. But the faster they implement UID2, the faster that will accelerate for them. And as we see more authentication and more options in terms of the way consumers can pay, it's either through sharing a little bit more of their time to see ads or paying a bit more money, we'll see more and more of them choose the ads as has historically always been the case. And as a result, that means better and bigger partnerships for us. So, I really just think we have to continue to be a great partner to the content owners and keep showing up the way that we have. But otherwise, those macro vectors are the things that are really going to drive this. Really appreciate the question. You bet. I appreciate the question, Jason. Of course, I'll take the first part and then Laura, she'll take the second part. So you're right, that as money shifts from linear or traditional television into CTV, it, of course, has an opportunity to be reallocated. And whenever a CMO or a media buyer has the option to reconsider, of course, the first place where they're usually looking is to do something very similar. And let's not forget that television has always focused on being a top-of-the-funnel activity where you're creating awareness. I would argue that's where the heavy lifting of advertising is done which is the process of winning hearts and minds. Hearts and minds are not historically won in 240 blue and black characters. They are won with moving picture and audio and emotion. And that work continues to be done at the top of the funnel in CTV. So I would argue that CTV right now is the most effective television advertising that television had ever seen. And arguably, it's the most effective advertising at scale ever. So I don't anticipate that most of those dollars are moving to formats that are way different and way different location in the funnel like search or social. Those budgets are not going there. It does have -- as you point out, it does have the opportunity to leave video. But why would it when CTV is way more effective? And I would argue that the effectiveness has gone up more than the cost. And that as we see supply and demand continue, we might see more opportunities to find value as well as the target. And then, of course, as UID adoption continues to go up, the efficacy will as well. So even though I think we're doing the most effective advertising that we've ever done in television, I think there's still lots of room for exponential growth in efficacy. So when you look at all of those sort of macro trends and with the facts, I think it's inevitable that CTV gets the vast majority of that transitioning from linear and traditional and even potentially, additional spend. So Laura, your portion of that question. You bet. So I would say today and these are very broad buckets. This isn't a reflection of our spend. This is me giving a commentary on the macro space. As the dollar moves over from traditional television into CTV, it's mostly gone into 3 different buckets relatively evenly. The first is to work directly with the content owner and create essentially an insertion order again. The second is to work with us through a programmatic guaranteed and then the third is to work through biddable fully decisioned programmatic. Those have roughly been equal. You're seeing the first and second converge and then the third category is, of course, the fastest growing. So when I talk about the need for television to embrace programmatic, I'm really talking about the need for it to embrace fully-decisioned programmatic because that's where content owners get higher CPMs. That's also where advertisers get the highest effectiveness and that's the only place where they're willing to pay a premium. The first and second have been increasingly converging over the last couple of years, while those were even a few years ago. More and more, they're moving towards the second and third category with the final destination really being that third category. That's how we see all of CTV moving because that's where efficacy and price and the healthiness of the ecosystem stabilizing. You bet. I appreciate the question. So let me just remind everybody what OpenPath is. And Tim, again, really appreciate the question because I think this is something we haven't talked enough about. And you are right. OpenPath celebrated its first birthday at the beginning of this year. And it's been the fastest-growing path, if you will, or a route supply chain to inventory on our platform. And what it is, is the ability for publishers who want to do their own yield management to plug in to us directly. Where historically they would use an SSP. This time, they can plug into us directly. Part of the reason for that is because more and more companies are wanting to do their own yield management. We initially really highlighted the need for journalists or journalistic outlets to embrace this because their need for authentication as well as CPMs to go up was greater than any other part of the ecosystem. So it was really launched with journalism because that's where they needed the help the most. Where it moves the needle perhaps the most is in connected television. And the reason why it moves the needle so much in connected television is because the content ownership, unlike on the browsing web, where you have millions of websites, you only have dozens of companies in the U.S. And as I've said before, I believe television is perfectly fragmented for a business like ours. But that makes it so that they're all big enough for them to have their own yield management functions. It makes it so that we can plug in directly with them and then make certain that the option has a higher degree of integrity than if it were routed through Google or somewhere else for that matter. So we've launched OpenPath as a means of making certain that the pipes are clean and that has made certain that connected television has an ecosystem or a supply chain that is cleaner than others which is really great for CTV and its future. Thanks for the question. You bet. So implicit in the question is that, hey, when -- as the macro continues to improve, where will you make additional investments? We're investing as aggressively as we can right now. So I know we're sort of showing our operating leverage but that's not because we're saying let's flex our operating leverage. We're instead trying to grow as aggressively as we can. But as Laura highlighted in the change in headcount both this year and next year as it relates to our overall growth, that's in part because we surged our hiring during the pandemic and over the last few years so that we could capture opportunities like this one, including that we're shipping the biggest release in the history of the company this year. We started that in June. We've been releasing throughout the year. So we'll continue to make investments in that same way. But I believe those are the investments that are making it so that it's really hard for anybody to take that away from us. We spend most of our time thinking about how we compete with the biggest technology companies in the world. And the way that we compete is not to play the game the way they do. Most of them have conflict of interest all over the place and most brands are terrified to hand over their data and honestly to hand over their future to those businesses so that they're dependent on growth to come from just handing over their budgets and hoping that they get good stuff. Instead with us, they have somebody who doesn't own any media and that is a feature, not a bug, in that we help them objectively decide what media they should buy because we don't have a dog in that hunt. And by not having a conflict of interest, we help them to buy objectively across the entire media landscape, especially the most perfectly fragmented portion of that which is in CTV. The best way for us to stay ahead and I say this to our team all the time, is to do the very same things that got us here. We align our interest with our clients, we maintain our objectivity and we innovate like hell. And that's what we've been doing all this year. That's what we expect to continue to do. That becomes even easier to do from an IR standpoint as times get better and better. But we've been doing it now. We'll keep doing it in the future. That's what got us here. That's what's going to get us to the future that we know we can obtain if we just keep executing. Yes. So I suppose it depends on who you ask inside of those premium content owners. But to me, the math is fairly obvious and even conceptually, it's fairly obvious. And I know that Michael Barrett's business can't really participate on the buy-side decisioning that is that third bucket. So it's natural for him to focus on the first 2 and talk about the things that are great about those 2 buckets. But if you step back, the third bucket which is fully-decisioned programmatic is the one where the advertiser gets to bring their own data to the equation, is the one where they say, \"These are the users that I want.\" It's the one where it realizes the potential of CTV advertising because the ads are relevant. Every single person here or hearing this has seen television ads that are not relevant to them. And that's driven by a system that has historically always been focused on content, where I want to match this advertiser with this content and just sort of spray and pray. That isn't what will happen in the future. That isn't what's happening in that third bucket today which is that you can bring your own data and show ads that are highly relevant so that you don't just use the show as a proxy for audience. The show was always used as proxy for audience. And sometimes, it lines up really nicely which is most people who watch football are more likely to drink beer. And so as a result, those 2 have been married really well. And that's part of the reason why ESPN content is some of the most expensive. But if you can take an ID and make certain that the ad is relevant and customize that and make it so that you're only showing ads to those that are relevant, only then can you make it so that these 4 minutes per 60 that are being used for ads which is what, 1/4 of what happens in traditional television, only then can you make the CPMs go up high enough to justify the additional cost. So long-term, we're all heading to that last bucket. It's the only place where the math makes sense. It's the only place where you really get the benefits of digital. And inside of all of those big content companies, there are groups of people that understand that, that's where we're all heading, even though not necessarily everybody gets that the traditional models of selling are not the best ways to monetize television going forward."

            "name": "Laura Schenkein",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon. As you have seen in our Q3 results, we have continued to execute extremely well. During the quarter, we continued to grab share and outpace our peers. We delivered accelerating year-over-year revenue growth, managed our expenses efficiently and delivered strong adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. Our results are a reflection of the premium advertisers are placing on precision, agility and transparency as they continue to shift away from linear media and walled gardens. Revenue in Q3 was $493 million, representing growth of 25% year-over-year, an acceleration from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year was about 27% on a year-over-year basis. We continue to win spend as marketers increasingly focus their investment on platforms that deliver value, particularly in premium video like CTV. This is a dynamic we've seen many times over the years. When the macro environment presents challenges, brands shift to platforms and channels that offer flexibility and measurable results. During the third quarter, CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we won incremental shopper marketing budgets and brought the Retail Sales Index to market. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q2 with notably strong performance in CTV. With the strong top line performance in Q3, we generated approximately $200 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 40% of revenue. This led to free cash flow of $184 million in Q3, marking over $600 million of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. I'm proud of our ability to generate strong profitability while continuing to invest in our business as that will help fund our future growth. Because of our fortunate position within an incredibly large addressable market, one of our greatest responsibilities is ensuring that we are growing sustainably while also generating sufficient profitability and cash flow. Our team has done a remarkable job achieving this as we balance short-term opportunities with our long-term financial vision. From a scale channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q3, video which includes CTV, represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represents about 87% of our business in Q3 and international represented about 13%. We are very pleased that international growth slightly outpaced North America for the third quarter in a row. CTV across EMEA and North Asia was very strong during the quarter, growing over 100% year-over-year in each region. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, we continued to see strong performance in food and drink, travel and automotive. Health and fitness and business were below the average. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q3 were $316 million, up 29% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. Income tax expense was $18 million for the third quarter, driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and non-deductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $167 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $192 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $184 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 91 days, down about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. In Q3, via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 1.2 million shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $90 million. We exited the third quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. First, we continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and retail media. That said, we have seen more macroeconomic uncertainty at the start of Q4. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $580 million which would represent growth of 18% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a mid-single-digit percent of spend in Q4 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q4 of this year would be about 22% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $270 million in Q4. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter and we are cautiously optimistic for Q4. We continue to demonstrate our ability to drive momentum across our company priorities, achieve profitable growth and drive significant share gains. Regardless of what the macro brings, we believe we have never been in a better position than we are in today. With large growth drivers, including the ongoing secular shift to CTV, upgrading measurement with retail data, our biggest product release ever with Kokai, growth in international markets, an identity framework that has never been stronger, the U.S. presidential election cycle, amongst others, we remain optimistic for the remainder of Q4 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Absolutely. Thanks, Vasily, for the question. So the way I view this is that coming off of a strong Q3, we continued to see that strength going into the first week of Q4. Starting in the second week is when we saw some advertisers become more cautious in their spend. And we saw this cautiousness across a few verticals that Jeff mentioned, such as automotive, consumer electronics and handsets and media and entertainment. And of course, some of the caution is transitory due to what we mentioned, the strikes in auto and in media and in entertainment. We continue, at the same time, to see strong spend in our largest drivers such as CTV and retail media. And through today which is a weekend change into November, we've seen spend stabilize so we're cautiously optimistic for the remainder of Q4. Jeff, is there anything you'd add to that? Yes. So I'm going to repeat something I've said before which is that we have a great luxury. We're high growth, we're profitable. We've got cash flow. And in 2023, we're growing well into the double digits above 20%. So all of that allows us to save the course to continue investing in areas such as CTV, AI or platform measurement and to still deliver that strong profitability and cash flow. So as we and you start to think about 2024 for The Trade Desk, there are a few things I keep in mind. First, we've been deliberate in our investments in hiring. So we're going to grow headcount this year but only at about 15% to 17%. And importantly, we expect a similar trajectory next year which should allow us to grow headcount slower than revenue growth. That leads to a very nice setup for 2024. I'd also add that our investments include Kokai, AI, the forward market and we don't see any material increases as others have with investments in areas like that. We're also focusing heavily on productivity with our engineering teams, our go-to-market teams, everyone at sales, account management and trading. And I'd close with, I've been here about 10 years now and I couldn't be more confident in our model, our growth, our ability to drive profitability and cash flow in both the near and the long term. Thank you for the questions. Yes, fantastic. So in talking about the guide, what I would say is that we guide to what we see. We always have since I've been here. That includes what's been observed quarter-to-date through the 9th of November. It also includes what our team and what our clients are indicating for the rest of the year. And though I recognize that there's cautiousness in the environment, so all of that is taken into consideration. So I'm optimistic for the remainder of Q4. And we believe in this environment. It's good to listen to our customers, listen to our team and it's better to be cautious. Chris, I appreciate the question. We actually aren't going to provide further guidance on exact year-over-year growth figures, both with and without election spend in the base for October, the first week of November or exiting the year. But you know correctly that we did see that drop-off in the second week of October and stabilization going into November. So all of that is factored into that guide. Of course, it was growing. I'm smiling as I say that."

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth . Please proceed. Chris Toth. Please proceed.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provide a more meaningful representation of the company\u2019s operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green.: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you\u2019ve seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the second quarter. We reported revenue of $464 million growing 23% compared with last year. This also represents an acceleration in our growth rate compared with the first quarter. And just like the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. What\u2019s particularly notable about our performance is that most advertisers are still dealing with some degree of uncertainty in their business. Even though certain macro indicators are improving, there\u2019s still a sense from many advertisers that we are in an unpredictable environment. For them, it\u2019s hard to dismiss what we\u2019ve been through over the last 2 to 3 years with the global pandemic, rampant inflation, supply chain crises and banking system uncertainty, and of course, global rebalancing. None of these market dynamics have been very predictable the last few years. And this year, like the last few, has similarly had lots of never-before macro events. So while many indicators and advertiser sentiments are improving, there\u2019s also a sense that it\u2019s more difficult than ever to predict what\u2019s coming next. But in this environment, marketers have learned that data-driven precision can bring a sense of certainty and reliability to their advertising efforts. Because of the innovations we brought to market in areas such as retail media, CTV, identity and data, advertisers have a clearer sense than ever of the performance and impact of their ad campaigns. And with Kokai, we are delivering even more innovation, all in service of helping advertisers drive precision, relevance and certainty in everything they do. As a result, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing more multiyear joint business plans, or JBPs, with leading agencies and brands representing spend projections in future years well into the billions of dollars. Our relative outperformance over the last few quarters means we have gained more market share than in any other period in our company\u2019s history. Advertisers have become more deliberate with their spend and have increasingly gravitated to our platform and as they understand more about the power of programmatic, they are choosing the objectivity and performance of our platform over the murkiness of walled gardens more than ever before. Even as we continue to grow and scale around the world, we see no deviation from our 95%-plus retention rate. Our clients rely on us more and more. I was at the Cannes Advertising Festival a few weeks ago, and I could have filled my calendar several times over with brand CMOs, agency leaders and CEOs of our key partners, all of whom want to understand how we can work more closely together. Every year, demand for the value that we deliver continues to grow. Perhaps what\u2019s most interesting right now is how marketers are seeking a sense of certainty in an uncertain environment. Much of the product rollouts and partnership growth we\u2019ve seen this year is because we\u2019re giving our clients certainty and reliability that they can\u2019t get elsewhere. This shows up all over our client base and all over our platform, but I\u2019d like to talk today about a few places where the certainty and reliability is really driving our relative outperformance particularly in retail media, CTV and identity. By discussing these 3, I believe it will provide some insight as to why we continue to outperform the market, why I believe we\u2019ll continue to outperform the market and why we continue to invest in our platform with all the innovations coming from Kokai. So first, let me talk about retail media, which has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business. Much like CTV, our rapid growth in retail media starts with our focus on objectivity. Retailers know we\u2019re only here to serve advertisers and to drive more precision and efficacy in ad campaigns. We don\u2019t compete with them. And like all of our partners, retailers know, we are careful and objective stewards of their data. As you know, Walmart was one of the first early major retailers to understand the power of their data and to help advertisers understand and measure the connection between campaign spend and actual consumer purchases. For many advertisers, there\u2019s no clear measurement of performance than that. You can look at all kinds of traditional marketing KPIs, but there\u2019s nothing more powerful than knowing that a consumer bought your product because of the ad you serve and then using that data to improve marketing spend in the future. One of the great recent examples of this is Fruit of the Loom, working with our agency, GSD&M, Fruit of the Loom wanted to reach new and existing customers to increase sales with a back-to-school promotion. They were targeting a 200% return on ad spend, or ROAS, working with the Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk, they were able to predict audiences with much more precision and were able to understand in real time, how ads in different channels were performing. They could then shift campaign dollars to those channels that were actually driving consumer purchases. This clear line of sight helps Fruit of the Loom vastly exceed their campaign goals, delivering a 1,200% return on ad spend among existing customers and more than 1,000% ROAS with new customers. Eric Mahoney is Fruit of the Loom\u2019s Digital Marketing Manager. He said, and I quote, historically, we\u2019ve done a really good job of reaching our brand purchasers. But working with the Walmart DSP allowed us to reach that new consumer through predictive audience segments. We could not have achieved these results without Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk.\" He also said that working with The Trade Desk is like putting on a fresh pair of underwear. Of all the accolades we\u2019ve received over the years that is definitely one of my favorites ever. The gravitational pull of retail media is not limited to the U.S., retailers around the world are working with The Trade Desk in different ways to unleash the power of their data to help advertisers bring more value to their campaigns. In Singapore, we partnered with FairPrice, the largest grocery chain there with 570 stores serving 90% of the country\u2019s population. One of the first brands to leverage FairPrice shopper data on our platform was Coca-Cola, who wanted to reach customers during the festive Lunar New Year season. They also wanted to be able to measure the performance of low-funnel marketing outreach across multiple channels, including OTT, audio, digital out-of-home and of course, open Internet display. The campaign tapped into FairPrice\u2019s audience segments via our platform, targeting Fair-Price customers who had purchased Coke or other Coke products over the past 1 to 3 months. They were able to target seasonal shoppers who purchased festive products and optimize in real time to the news and lifestyle channels that delivered the best results. With their agency, EssenceMediacom, Coke was able to drive 189% uplift in sales during the campaign. They were also able to measure consumer reaction in a range of new ways, including the time it takes for a consumer to buy a product following different kinds of ad exposures, audience engagement from different channels and cart values offirst time and repeat buyers. The retail media opportunity is also growing exponentially for us in Europe. In recent quarters, we\u2019ve talked about our partnerships with leading retailers such as Ocado and Tesco. And just a few weeks ago, we announced a partnership with Europe\u2019s largest retail group, Schwarz, which includes major brands such as Kaufland and Lidl. From an advertising perspective, retail media is something that\u2019s really taken off over the last 2 years. It\u2019s no coincidence that the growing interest in retail media coincides with growing advertiser focus on authenticated ad environments. With retail media, advertisers can start with precise authenticated data whether that data is based on purchase history or loyalty data. From there, the advertiser can target based on what they know and then do more accurate data-driven modeling to expand targeting segments with greater precision Some of the same dynamics are behind the rapid growth of CTV advertising. As we have all seen in recent weeks, there is a ton of focus right now on the business model of TV. What is the future of the linear TV model? And how does the TV industry create sustainable, profitable business models for streaming TV as viewers shift there in mass. I believe the answer will come in fully exploring the authenticated viewer data that sits at the core of the CTV ecosystem, which is something that today\u2019s leading media companies are exploring. For the past couple of years, CTV has been one of our fastest-growing channels at scale. There are a range of reasons for that. Fundamentally, video remains the most effective way for brands to influence the hearts and minds of consumers. And with CTV, brands can apply data to their TV campaigns and measure with much more precision, the effectiveness of every ad dollar. And much like retail, advertisers value the authenticated audiences that come with CTV, pretty much every streaming TV viewer is logged in with an e-mail address. For advertisers, this means more certainty. It also creates a new starting point centered on data. These dual forces of retail and CTV are truly bringing the power of data-driven decisioning home for advertisers, and it is accelerating their shift to programmatic on our platform. Whereas in the early years of programmatic, we were looking to find ways to affix data to campaigns. Today, we use data as a starting point for campaigns. Instead of hunting for ad opportunities with data, The Trade Desk and marketers are starting with data to know which media opportunities we should hunt for. It\u2019s a different dynamic and it\u2019s one that\u2019s become more prominent as advertisers seek more certainty in an uncertain and unpredictable environment. As I said, media companies generally understand the value of authenticated user data. And this is a major reason why the top streaming companies in the U.S. have pretty much all integrated with UID2 or are planning to. The latest was Warner Bros. Discovery, who announced at Cannes that they will integrate UID2 across all of their streaming properties, including Max and Discovery+. The broad embrace of UID2 across the CTV ecosystem has been driven in part by a key economic factor. Streaming leaders need to unleash the value of their authenticated data for advertisers in order to create as much precision and relevance as possible, thereby maximizing their CPMs. In order for the streaming business model to thrive and for media companies to keep pace in the content arms race, they need to maximize advertising revenue. As we have seen with every streaming platform launching an ad-supported service, a subscription based approach is not enough. And the only way to maximize advertising revenue is to increase precision and relevance. With UID2, the advertiser can start with authenticated data, enrich that with their own and third-party data and then where they can find the right relevant audience, they will pay a meaningfully higher price. As Tim Sims outlined during our Investor Day, where advertisers are able to bid with certainty based on relevance and precision, the value of each impression increases significantly, generally, exponentially. Ultimately, this is how we will answer some of the vexing questions that have been swirling around the TV industry recently. And while we are still in the early days of the CTV advertising revolution, I\u2019m confident that emerging innovations on our platform, such as a forward market for CTV advertising will only accelerate advertisers\u2019 ability and appetite to fund this amazing new golden age of TV. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that this is an increasingly global trend. At Cannes this year, for example, we announced a new partnership with RTL, one of the largest pan-European media companies. Through this partnership, our international advertisers will have exclusive programmatic access to RTL\u2019s addressable linear and connected TV inventory. We are starting with inventory across Germany, Spain, France and Austria with more European markets to follow soon. This represents our most significant step yet into the European CTV market. It\u2019s also indicative of how the major European media companies are keeping pace with changing viewer preferences and advertiser demand to meet viewers where they are and where they are most leaned in. As many of you have seen, we had a lot to say about retail and CTV during our recent Kokai launch. And I\u2019d just like to take a moment to put that in perspective. Because as advertisers increasingly prioritize CTV and retail, it\u2019s critical that we continue to innovate in our platform so that we surface value for our users as intuitively as possible. One way Kokai accomplishes this is with a series of new indexes or benchmarks that help advertisers understand and measure performance. In the retail arena, we launched the Retail Sales Index. The RSI helps advertisers understand the impact of their retail media spend across multiple retailers at once. In this way, we are massively reducing the complexity of measuring ad campaigns that run across multiple retail data sets. Now advertisers can understand which retail environments perform better at different times, in which channels, for which kinds of creatives, all in 1 place. And in doing so, we are providing a level of objectivity and measurement from the bottom of the funnel all the way to the top, that is simply not possible within a walled garden. In addition to that, we also announced a few pioneering retailers who are making retail measurement available for free in our platform if the advertiser has activated their retail data for targeting. These retailers include Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons. This is a major step forward in bringing the full value of retail media to bear in service of greater precision and certainty. In the CTV space, we launched the TV Quality Index, or TVQI. As the CTV advertising market has multiplied in terms of inventory, there are some who would have you believe that a piece of user-generated content has the same quality in the eyes of the viewer as professionally produced content or live sports. Yes, I know there are some UGC influencers who have millions of followers that some brands may target from time to time. But that\u2019s a very small slice of UGC. The vast bulk of it is very unattractive, and sometimes even unsafe for brand advertisers. The TVQI helps advertisers understand the value of the impressions they are buying in the context of the quality of the content those impressions are served against. The index shows that for every 10-point improvement in quality there is a 15-point improvement in conversion rates. Sometimes it\u2019s even higher than that. And for our own campaigns for The Trade Desk, in the second quarter of this year, as we were beta testing TVQI, we found that a 19-point increase in the index score resulted in a 50-point improvement in our conversion rate. If you\u2019re a marketing leader, these are substantial performance improvements. I mentioned those two elements of Kokai because they\u2019re important to understand in the context of CTV and retailer as more advertisers gravitate to CTV and retail because they offer more certainty in starting advertising campaigns based on authenticated audience data, these Kokai innovations provide more certainty through the course of the campaign in terms of measurement and performance optimization. Of course, there are many other aspects of Kokai that we unveiled on 06/06, some of which are live and many of which we will be launching in the next few months. These indexes and other innovations, especially around the application of AI across our platform are helping us surface value more intuitively to advertisers. We are revamping our UX so that the campaign setup and optimization experience is even more intuitive with data next to decisions at every step. And we\u2019re making it easier than ever for thousands of data, inventory, measurement and media partners to integrate with us. In doing so, I believe that The Trade Desk will become an essential innovation hub of the open Internet. I\u2019d like to end on this point because I think it\u2019s important to reiterate that there are many things we do at The Trade Desk that are not in our immediate business interest. UID2, for example, is an innovation we devised about 3 years ago and promptly gave it away to the industry. We\u2019re seeing broad adoption across the data and inventory ecosystems of the open Internet and accelerating use by advertisers. In many ways, the industry is looking at innovations like UID2 as a core element of the flight to certainty that is driving a lot of advertiser action today. If an advertiser has certainty that they are reaching the right person across all channels, they will prioritize that ad buy. CTV and retail are major advancements in this regard, but UID2 is a major building block of this new cross-channel identity fabric too. This is particularly important as there has recently been a lot of speculation regarding the potential demise of third-party cookies in Chrome in early 2024. A lot of this speculation reminds me of the frenzy in 2017 when Safari deprecated cookies or more recently in 2021 when Apple made its IDFA changes. Each time I have stated that none of this will have a significant material effect on our business, and that was true. I\u2019ve said many times that I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s in Google\u2019s best interest to get rid of third party cookies because of the harmful impact it will likely have on publishers that have not implemented a strong identity strategy. But while it matters a lot to many browser-based publishers, in the long run, it really doesn\u2019t matter that much to us. Advertisers will increasingly select ad opportunities where they can act with certainty and leverage their own data. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve spent so much time today talking about CTV, retail and UID2 as they have become essential building blocks of the open Internet. On the supply side, we developed OpenPath, to provide our clients with a direct transparent path to inventory. This is just the latest effort by the Trade Desk to improve supply-side transparency and objectivity and we now have thousands of destinations across the open Internet, integrating with OpenPath. And when advertisers see an OpenPath channel to inventory, they are more likely to select it versus the 8 to 10 alternative paths to that same impression because there\u2019s more certainty. And now integrating with UID2, OpenPath or any number of other innovations or offerings on our platform is easier than ever with Kokai. We believe that to truly optimize the value of the open Internet, there are many ways in which the industry needs to innovate together. So we can provide advertisers as an ecosystem with more certainty, transparency and objectivity. In recent weeks, we\u2019ve heard even more about the alleged dubious behavior of walled gardens, whether it\u2019s from the European Commission or independent research reports. Advertisers and media companies are increasingly aware that they need to work with technology partners who represent their interest, not conflicts of interest. As a result, advertising dollars are shifting to our platform. And we will continue to invest in our platform and push the industry to create even more value for advertisers on the open Internet. Our recent outperformance is not a temporary blip, I believe it is the start of a reassessment of the value of the Internet, particularly from an advertiser\u2019s perspective, and I could not be more excited about the growth opportunity that is in front of us in the years ahead as a result. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Laura to cover our financials.\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. For nearly the past 10 years, I\u2019ve experienced firsthand all of the incredible work from The Trade Desk teams around the world that produce our outstanding performance that have enabled us to manage the right balance between strong growth and significant profitability. I\u2019m proud to present our results today and going forward. With that, on to the numbers. As you\u2019ve seen in our results, Q2 was a strong quarter. Revenue was $464 million, representing growth of 23% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year was about 24.5% on a year-over-year basis. Visibility and advertiser sentiment continued to improve throughout the quarter, and we continue to gain share as marketers increasingly focus their investments on areas where data is deployed effectively, where AI and decisioning produce high ROI and where results are measurable and transparent. Our growth continued to be driven by the shift of budgets to connected TV and increasing use of retail data. Because of our objectivity and our connectivity to nearly every major CTV content provider, our platform is the most eligible for the tidal wave of demand as it shifts away from linear and walled gardens. In retail media, many of the largest retailers around the world are now our partners and more and more brands and agencies are taking advantage of this powerful data in their campaigns. We also continue to benefit from the trust we\u2019ve built with our clients, launching innovative products in the interest of the demand side, paving cleaner path to supply and cultivating industry-wide support for improved identity solutions like UID2 and EUID. During the second quarter, growth was broad-based across channels, verticals and regions. CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum again in retail media as we launched integrations with more retailers and won incremental shopper marketing budgets. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q1 with notably strong performance in CTV. And with the launch of Kokai in early June, we are well positioned for the second half of the year and 2024 as visibility and advertiser sentiment improve. With the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $180 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 39% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance throughout all our financial statements as was the case again in Q2. This outperformance led to free cash flow of $119 million in Q2. Our unique ability to generate meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow continues to put us in a strong position as we look ahead and invest in the critical areas of the business that will drive our growth in the years to come. This is an area I\u2019m intently focused on, making certain that our productivity and efficiency remains best-in-class as we scale as we manage both industry-leading growth and significant profitability. I believe this is a critical factor to our success in the next phase of growth. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q2 and international represented about 12%. We are pleased that international Growth slightly outpaced North America for the second quarter in a row. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel more than doubled compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover. Automotive was strong once again with growth accelerating each month during the quarter due to share gains and recovery. We also saw strong performance in home and garden and food and beverage, while shopping and business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still opportunity for us to gain share in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q2 were $305 million, up 22% year-over-year. There are ample opportunities to achieve significantly more leverage within our operating expenses. However, our primary objective remains on growing spend on our platform and grabbing land. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, included realized costs from our 2022 hiring ramp, infrastructure investments and return to office expenses. Because we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the last few years, we\u2019re in a strong position to continue innovating for clients, growing our teams and widening the distance between us and our competitors. Income tax expense was $27 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $139 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $128 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $119 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 92 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 76 days, up about 3 days from a year ago. In Q2 via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 595,000 shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $44 million. We exited the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $485 million, which would represent growth of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year would be about 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $185 million in Q3. In closing, we\u2019re extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. I\u2019ve always seen the immense opportunity this company has. And frankly, that opportunity has never been clearer than it is today. We have a large and growing addressable market in front of us. We have a business model that\u2019s proven to generate strong top line growth in addition to significant profitability and cash flow. With growth drivers including CTV, retail media or international business, a strong identity strategy, a 2024 U.S. election year cycle, and a significant product upgrade with Kokai, among others, we remain highly optimistic about our future as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shyam Patil from SIG.\nShyam Patil: Congrats on another strong performance. I had a 2-part question. First for Jeff, could you provide your thoughts on the macro and the current conditions and also your initial thoughts on next year, on 2024? And then Laura, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about investments and expenses in the back half of this year, but also next year as well.\nJeff Green: Thanks for the question, Shyam. I\u2019ll go first, and then I\u2019ll just hand it over to Laura to talk about investments and expenses. So it\u2019s not news to anybody here that the last 2 or 3 years have been a few years of uncertainty and unpredictability for most advertisers and most of the Fortune 500. As a result, I\u2019m extremely excited by the change in sentiment that we\u2019ve seen in Q2 and see already in Q3, where CMOs are doubling down on what\u2019s driving growth there\u2019s an understanding, of course, that the markets have begun to recover, and there\u2019s more certainty than they\u2019ve had in the past. But they\u2019ve also come to rely on data-driven advertising during that time of uncertainty as a place for certainty and for results. So we\u2019re seeing lots of shifts due to what they\u2019ve experienced in the last few years in CTV. And then, of course, this massive secular tailwind that comes from retail data as well. As I\u2019ve said before, I believe ultimately, the shape of the Internet changes dramatically as a result of CTV and retail media. And then, of course, we\u2019ve also seen some amazing results as a result of UID2 adoption. You might have caught during the prepared remarks that Warner Bros. was kind of the last of the U.S. independent CTV players to adopt UID2. So now, in a way, UID2 has the full collection here in the United States, and that has become the common currency to monetize CTV in the ad environment. We expect that trend to continue, and we\u2019re seeing more and more of that. For the second part of your question for me, 2024 is looking like the tidal wave of opportunity that is both daunting as well as just massive in terms of what an incredible chance this is for us to once again grab land. So let me first just talk about some of the backdrop for 2024. So there\u2019s been a lot of pressure on Google over the last few years as it relates to antitrust as well as privacy. Of course, there\u2019s a balance between those 2 that a few years ago, there was a lot more pressure on the privacy side of that. Today, there\u2019s a lot more pressure on the antitrust side of that, which we think overall makes the market a bit more fair and makes it easier to predict Google\u2019s decisions. It also makes it so that they are undoubtedly going slower and that creates opportunity for us to once again grab land. I have said over and over again that linear television is not going to be a steady decline. It ends with an explosion. It\u2019s going to have a pretty steady, then accelerating decay. And then there\u2019s a point where it stops being worth it for anybody to operate in the space. You\u2019ve kind of got a glimpse of this when Bob Iger was saying 3 weeks ago on CNBC, that he\u2019s unsure about ABC\u2019s future and their linear business model being broken, but of course, that streaming and the studios are very important to the future of the business. That business model is really talking about legacy linear and broadcast television and that, of course, the future is streaming. That represents one of the many opportunities for us in 2024. Now as our opportunity to demonstrate the power of decisioning, which is really what our brand new product release Kokai is all about. We also have some major advances going into next year as it relates to the forward market. But when you add CTV retail media, Kokai, UID2, OpenPath, international opportunities, political, the list goes on and on. Of course, Disney announced today that they\u2019ll roll out ad-supported models internationally for Disney+. We think that\u2019s one of many opportunities around the world for us as it relates to CTV. So the secular tailwinds just keep piling up, but very excited about all that. I\u2019ll turn it over to Laura to talk about investments and expenses.\nLaura Schenkein: Thanks, Jeff, and Shyam, thanks for the question. In terms of our investments for the second half of 2023 and going into 2024, I\u2019ll start off just the big picture and then get into the specifics of what we\u2019re seeing. So just always remind myself that we\u2019ve got the great luxury of high growth, profitability and cash flow. And we\u2019ve been responsibly managing our headcount, OpEx growth and investments for many years now. So in the first half of 2023, we grew revenue in the 20% range. And we just guided to continued growth acceleration in revenue when you exclude U.S. election spend that we saw in the same period in 2022. So from my perspective, we\u2019re in an enviable position, while many of our other peers have struggled. So when I look out at the rest of 2023, I just look at how we\u2019re being very deliberate in our investments and in our hiring, and we still expect headcount to grow this year, but roughly at half the rate of last year, which implies around 20%. And that sets us up very nicely for 2024, just as I remind everyone that our people are our largest area of investment. We\u2019re also investing heavily into our platform and our products, specifically in areas like CTV and our forward market product and in retail media. And as we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re focusing heavily on productivity and efficiency with all of our teams from our engineering teams to our go-to-market, business, sales AM and trading teams to make sure that we believe that all of our teams are firing on all cylinders. For this year, we also expect CapEx to be lower than last year. So last year, we came in with around $80 million of investments. And I\u2019d expect that to be around $60 million in 2023. And just a reminder, our CapEx levels include all of our AI investments, and we don\u2019t expect any significant step-up in investments that you may have seen in some other firms. So just to sum up and as it relates to our modeling, as we\u2019ve seen in the past, when we outperform on the top line, that usually drops down to the bottom line as happened in Q1 and Q2 of this year. And we\u2019re very comfortable with where things stand and cautiously optimistic about our business for the rest of the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI.\nShweta Khajuria: Jeff, I have a question on cookie deprecation. So you touched on this in your prepared remarks, and there\u2019s quite a bit of focus on it given that we are coming close to 2024 here and Google\u2019s plan to deprecate cookies. Would love to hear your thoughts on you think the magnitude of impact on Trade Desk, in particular, why you think it\u2019s not going to be meaningful and the overall industry, how you think about the impact? A - Jeff Green You bet. Thanks Shweta, I appreciate the question. So first, let me just say, we\u2019ve been down this path before. So when Safari made cookies go away, there was anxiety, when GDPR first came out, there was anxiety and IDFA removal happened, there was anxiety. And in every one of those cases, our business continued to grow, and we saw very little impact, a speed bump at best. So I see this as slightly \u2013 or not slightly, exactly the same as all of those other things. But the reason for that is because a phenomenon that is just different about our business than most other businesses that are in the space. And so we look at 12 million ad opportunities every second and we choose from those 1 million or 2 million that we want to buy. If identity is removed from \u2013 instead of it being on 6 million, it\u2019s now a 3 million, it just informs which ones we buy differently. We\u2019re still going to buy the same amount, and we\u2019re still going to be informed on the vast majority of those and in part because we\u2019ve been so strong in growing CTV as well as leveraging UID2, we have an alternative in the biggest driver of our business in CTV that is present on nearly 100% of impressions, which is way better than anything in the browsing Internet world. So just to be clear, but this directly impacts is the browsing Internet world of everything that runs on top of Chrome. So now let me talk for a second about the industry and be a bit more holistic because hopefully, I\u2019ve made my point that I don\u2019t believe this impacts us in any meaningful way. And in fact, I think you can make the argument that it affects us in a positive way just as much as it does in a negative way just because it would be negative to all the players that are dependent on cookies and because so much of our business now is driven off of UID2 and CTV, I think you can make the argument that we would benefit from sort of hurting lots of the independent competition. It is actually for that reason that I believe it is a strategic mistake for Google to get rid of cookies. And as they\u2019re facing more antitrust scrutiny rather than any other regulatory scrutiny, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in their best interest to do, I think, because of the way that the case dates are stacking up that they won\u2019t likely make any decisions until the end of Q1 next year. If they do make cookies go away then, I do think it will be very bad for some publishers, especially those touching journalism, that were historically print journalists, I do believe that will really have a bad effect upon them. And it won\u2019t have a great effect on the open Internet. But I do think it will be good for us. I do think that many of the consumer data companies will actually be better off because nearly all of their data is anchored off of an e-mail address. And the way that we leverage data is just much, much better in a world built around UID2. So I do think that it would accelerate the adoption of UID2 into the browsing Internet world, not just among CTV and audio and that would ultimately be good for us, but I don\u2019t think there would be a quick recovery for many of the web-based publishers, especially those affecting journalism. And so it will be a net negative for the open Internet, but probably a slight positive for us.\nOperator: The next question is from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research.\nVasily Karasyov: Jeff, I wanted to talk about retail media. You spoke about the success you\u2019re having with Walmart. We know that last year, there was a group of retailers that also came online. And so question number one, how is that coming along? Should we see contribution to revenue next year from those retailers? And then given that, would you be willing to update your thoughts on your plan in retail media that you gave us at your Investor Day, last October.\nJeff Green: You bet, thank you. So let me first explain one of the reasons why I think it\u2019s so exciting what\u2019s happening in shopper marketing. So of course, many retailers have been sitting on amazing data where they know what\u2019s actually being purchased, especially for those products that you tend to buy at the store and not online so many of the products in grocery stores and pharmacies are still primarily purchased in a store rather than online. And then, of course, many of them have amazing online presences as well as, of course, brick-and-mortar off-line. So many of them are bringing their data into the ecosystem, and they\u2019ve recognized that the way that they\u2019ve operated in the past creates a bit of a needle in a haystack problem where you take a small amount of data and you go look in that massive ocean of 12 million ads available every single second, and you go look for the usually thousands or tens of thousands that have your data on it. And so you start with the data and you go hunting for it. Well, in this new world where things are leveraging UID from the very beginning, you get rid of the sort of 9 dominos that need to fall in the supply chain so that you can then leverage the data, but instead, you start with the data and you\u2019re actually just looking at the opportunities that match that instead of going out and looking for opportunities in that way. So by starting with the data, you make it so that you get rid of the matching problems of cookies, and you make it so that the flywheel spin faster for all of these businesses. So they\u2019re not just making additional money on a small amount of data, but they\u2019re actually selling more products across their entire company. It\u2019s actually part of the reason why I believe that the moves that were made by 3 of the most the forward-looking pioneers in the retail data space, which includes Dollar General, Albertsons and Walgreens that we\u2019re all looking for an opportunity to do something new in data. They made their data available for free so long as people will pay to use it for targeting. So their data is available for measurement so that advertisers can, without any significant opt-in or any friction, find out where they\u2019re selling products, and it\u2019s their belief as well as ours that, that will make it so that people are automatically optimizing their advertising purchases to sell products in those 3 stores. If we are all proven right, we think this represents a massive change to the way people leverage data in brick-and-mortar stores and in retail. And that just will continue to accelerate this flywheel that is spinning in shopper marketing. I just want to remind everybody that shopper marketing is not just about shopper marketing itself, it is about improving the entire funnel. So every CPG has massive amount of incremental data and insight to know where to spend their money in advertising so that they are being more effective. So all of this has the sort of a flywheel effect of improving decisioning, moving more dollars to our platform, making efficacy go up across everything on our platform. And then, of course, there is an overlap between shopper marketing and CTV where they both benefit from each other, especially because in most cases, their data is anchored off of UID2, which of course, is e-mail based in both the shopper marketing world and in the CTV world. So all of that together creates just yet another amazing secular tailwind for us in shopper marketing or retail.\nOperator: The next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Cost: Maybe just on the CTV market. When we think about what you\u2019ve learned through the upfront, this year. How are you feeling about growth and trends in the market through the back half and into \u201924? And then on a related note, if you could just give an update on the new forward market. What is the level of interest in it? And how are those conversations trending to that new product? A - Jeff Green You bet, thank you. So let me just say that I have never been more bullish on CTV than we are right now and that includes all of the major news and headlines that are contributing to the current environment. You\u2019re seeing everyone in CTV look to add and/or enhance their ad-funded options. Nearly all of them are doubling down on the ad-funded options. So where there\u2019s just a few years ago, there was a religion around only having subscriptions and not having ads. That\u2019s gone, across the board. Everybody is looking to add ads and make them more effective. So the secular tailwind on our business is as great as it\u2019s ever been because of those things. Also because there, of course, is a writers and actors strike, that makes it \u2013 so it\u2019s much harder to sell at the upfront for all the content owners, which of course, the upfront is predominantly built for broadcast and legacy television. In order to take advantage of the very best of digital, we need a more sophisticated forward market than just the upfront, which is effectively a party where transactions are done with handshakes and very high-level data instead of the sort of precision that data-driven advertising can bring in an impression by impression and customized user by user, that environment can bring. And so our product that we have been working on literally for years on the forward market, makes it possible for people to have a much more sophisticated upfront buy. So the early phases have gone well. It is still very early phase. So I don\u2019t expect it to see all of the fruit harvested and even in 2024, this is going to be something that we build up over the years. But I see it in the long term being a very significant portion of our business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\nJustin Patterson: Jeff, I was hoping you could talk about the Kokai launch. I know it\u2019s really early, but would love to hear feedback on just initial reaction, how it\u2019s compared to your expectations? And just perhaps even stepping back, some of the behaviors you\u2019re observing from this versus what you\u2019ve seen in prior launches like Solimar and Next Wave. And as a quick follow-up for Laura. Could you talk a little bit about just linearity in June and July. There\u2019s been a couple of prints so far this earnings season talking about a little bit more macro softness in there. So curious about any trends you\u2019re seeing there.\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks Justin for the question. I\u2019ll take the first part and then have Laura, you take the second. So first, let me explain what Kokai is. So Kokai is a Japanese word that means open for business or open waters. And the reason why we chose that is because we believe this is a very important moment in the open Internet to make it possible for more and more companies to build to us in a variety of ways. One of them being to sell their products. So we have value-added resellers that are selling on our product all the time, whether that\u2019s in data, whether that\u2019s in algos, there\u2019s a whole bunch of ways with \u2013 contextual data, so many ways. And then the other is then is advertisers, in particular, bringing their first-party data to the table. And so with those as the overarching mission, Kokai has really built in 5 major sort of categories or pieces. The first is massive improvement to the use of data so you\u2019ll recall, we launched Galileo earlier this year, and we also announced that Kokai, the creation of a partner portal where people can integrate to onboard their first-party data. The second is the use of AI across our platform. You\u2019ll recall that we launched AI in our platform in 2018 before it was trendy. And we called it then Koa and distributing that AI across the platform in a variety of different ways and different deep learning models so that we\u2019re using that for very specific applications rather than trying to create one algo to rule them all, if you will, which is something we actually very \u2013 in a very disciplined way, try to avoid. So that we can create checks and balances in the way that the tech works, and we can make certain that AI is always providing improvements by essentially having A/B testing and better auditability. The third thing is measurement. So first, we improved data onboarding. Second, we improved AI distributed throughout the system. Third, we improved measurement so that we can to measure the efficacy of ads, especially using retail data. We came up with a couple of new ways of measuring, which is the Retail Sales Index, where we take a variety of different retailers and put all of their data together so that they\u2019re way better than the sum of the parts. And then TVQI, the TV Quality Index, we\u2019re helping advertisers see the benefit of being on premium content versus cat videos or worse that often comes from user-generated content. Then fourth, in the second half of the year, there will be a new user experience. So that\u2019s right around the corner, of course, because we\u2019re in the second half of the year. So very excited about what that means. I believe this is our biggest and most impressive U.S. upgrade ever, and it\u2019s going to create better behaviors among buyers and because it comes with much better forecasting, they\u2019ll get to see the decisions they\u2019re making and the impact before they even run, which is new. That is something much better than what we\u2019ve had over the last 14 years. I\u2019m very excited about what that means. And then last but not least is integrations for better CTV measurements and performance across the board as well. So lots to be excited about, but Kokai is our biggest relief. I expect it to be our most successful, but I will say that because this requires adoption during the busiest time of the year \u2013 because this requires a change in behavior, I don\u2019t expect there to be lots of adoption during the busiest time of the year. And so most of the benefits will be reaped in 2024 and 2025. But we\u2019re seeing a lot of the rollout of especially the first couple that I mentioned already seeing some impact already, seeing some performance enhancements. But as we go into 2024, we expect this to once again change the way that media buying is performed. Laura, do you mind taking the second half of the question?\nLaura Schenkein: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Justin. On linearity in June and July, we\u2019ve seen visibility improve as the year progressed. And we continue to see improving trends throughout Q2, where we saw our revenue growth accelerate to north of 23% year-over-year from around 21% in Q1. We exited June on a great trajectory, and that\u2019s continued so far in Q3. So we expect a strong Q3 for the same reasons that we outperformed the rest of digital advertising over the last few quarters, which is that we\u2019re continuing to see strong growth in CTV, in retail media and in international spend, all of which have been accretive to us this year. So I believe we remain \u2013 are well positioned for the second half of 2023 and even further out as we move into 2024.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Jeff, we\u2019ve seen some developments around \"premium\" marketplaces in CTV built around SSPs. As you talk with marketers, do you get a sense that some may be willing to give up some of the precision or expressiveness with which they manage their programmatic CTV budgets in exchange for a lower tax or are they really more focused on getting as precise as possible to maximize ROI?\nJeff Green: Yes. Thanks for the question. So let me first just describe a conversation that I had with the CEO of one of the publicly traded SSPs, where we were just talking about PG, or programmatic guarantees. And just talking about how he saw things. And he and I agreed that as people are moving budgets over from traditional television or linear \u2013 they are \u2013 sorry. As they\u2019re moving over budgets, from traditional TV or linear. They\u2019re often looking for programmatic guarantees as a place where they\u2019ll spend first. But as he and I both agreed, they always end with spending in decisions because decisioning is much, much better. So we\u2019ve recently done some studies on decisioning across the platform and compared it to PG. And we found that the value of decisioning or the performance of the decisioning on a CPA basis is 5x better in general, or if you were to say it in terms of savings, it\u2019s an 83% save in order to \u2013 in CPA costs in order to decision. So whatever incremental tax, as you put it comes, which is usually, in our case, the 20%-ish take rate, that take rate is more than justified by the power of decisioning that comes to the table. And that\u2019s exactly why even the SSPs and their leadership are predicting that long-term things move towards decisioning, but the PG is an on-ramp. We sometimes compare it to a freeway, where it\u2019s an on-ramp and you get on the freeway. But if you stay on the on-ramp, you\u2019re doing it wrong. And so that\u2019s what we see happening. That\u2019s what we think the SSPs see happening, but there will be some moves in the very short term towards these premium PMPs that are centered around especially programmatic guarantees that long term, we think, move towards decisioning and broader data usage.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan Salmon with New Street Research.\nDan Salmon: I got a 2-parter here. Jeff, maybe could you give us an update on any discussions you\u2019re having with industry bodies to act as a public administrator for UID2 in various markets? Is that still an important goal? Are you happy with existing relationships? And obviously, you\u2019ve got a lot of private integrations you\u2019ve done as well. And then second, you mentioned how identity is increasingly anchored by an e-mail address, yet it\u2019s pretty clear that Apple doesn\u2019t exactly love the use of e-mails for marketing purposes. Is that something that matters to you? Or do you feel comfortable with the level of consent that UID2 collects because Apple also seems fine when digital advertising uses consent in first-party data. Any views on that would be great.\nJeff Green: Yes. So let me go in reverse order just because I think the significance of your comments around Apple is important. So any of us that operate in the Apple ecosystem are putting in our Apple ID, which incidentally is an e-mail address over and over and over again. In fact, we\u2019re not even \u2013 we don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re putting it in most of the time. You\u2019re asked to put it in. You say, why? And then you put it in. And then you\u2019re asked again and then you put it in and you are asked again. Apple has used their e-mail-based identifier to provide personalization, they have updated many of the things that they said they wouldn\u2019t do before so that they can leverage that Apple ID to provide personalization. It is exactly that, that I think provides a validation that UID2 is one of the most privacy- centric ways to provide personalization across the Internet. It\u2019s used across many of the biggest platforms and with some of the biggest companies in the world, whether that\u2019s at Amazon, whether that\u2019s at Snowflake, whether that\u2019s at Disney, there\u2019s just hundreds of companies that are leveraging that, which of course, is based on an e-mail address not dissimilar from the massive empires at Google and Apple, which are also built around e-mail-based identifiers. So I don\u2019t think the comparison that Apple is allergic to them is fair because their entire ecosystem is built on an e-mail-based identifier. As it relates to the public administrator of UID2. Honestly, it\u2019s not that important. Most of our integrations are done privately. Of course, we were happy to hand it off and look for the right public administrator, as it continues to scale and as if it comes to a more pressing issue, but it hasn\u2019t been yet. We want to make certain that somebody that is that public administrator, of course, shares the vision of protecting the open Internet. And at times is willing to stand up and do the right thing even if it\u2019s not popular. That can be very difficult to find. And so that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be very deliberate about, but it has not slowed down anything in not having that. So we\u2019re not in any rush to change the status quo.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Zgutowicz with Benchmark.\nMark Zgutowicz: Jeff, just regarding earlier comment you made, I was hoping to get clarification how \u2013 I think you had said UID2 benefits you more in a cookie-less world. And I\u2019m just curious how that is because it\u2019s predominantly used as a matching mechanism between large pubs and advertisers and that data signal isn\u2019t sort of privy to you. So I\u2019m trying to just understand that a bit more. And then secondly, regarding OpenPath, appears that there\u2019s a natural hesitancy that we\u2019re hearing among publishers, large pubs to giving you more view into their CTV inventory or autonomy per se. I\u2019m just curious if you agree with that and how you overcome it.\nJeff Green: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. So the reason why we benefit from cookies potentially going away in the form of UID2 is that we have been saying to advertisers, every advertiser needs to have an identity strategy. We\u2019ve been saying to publishers, every publisher needs to have an identity strategy and an authentication strategy. And by authentication, we mean there needs to be some way that you\u2019re encouraging people to log in. And in the case that you have log-ins, finding some way to leverage them. Very few companies on the Internet are leveraging their log-ins to provide personalization to the level that they could be. And there certainly hasn\u2019t been much effort to leverage those outside of their own ecosystems or to make it possible for those that are bringing advertising demand to leverage the authentication on those particular publishers. If cookies were to go away, the need for that goes up dramatically and so for many of the publishers \u2013 and we saw this with GDPR, we saw this with the IDFA movement. There are many publishers that are saying, \"oh, well, wait until I have to. I\u2019ll wait to make changes until I have to.\" When they have to, they will make changes quickly. We saw a fire drill around GDPR among publishers, where they were very quickly working to create the right personalization again. And again, I just want to remind everybody what\u2019s at stake here. Think of how many print journalism companies have struggled to stay in business due to the Internet. And if you take their CPMs where they get a significant amount of revenue from $5 per ad to $2 per because relevance goes down, then they no longer can stay around. And that\u2019s why I say that cookies going away poses a threat to journalism. But that would make it so that they\u2019re very quickly leveraging those log-ins. And when you\u2019re saying, \"Oh, I get to see 1 out of 3 articles before I have to pay.\" I think you\u2019ll see a lot more of authentication at the beginning of almost every website, not dissimilar from if you go to a furniture or clothing website today. The very first thing you see is type in your e-mail address, you\u2019ll get 10% off. If you type in your e-mail address, only then will you get access to content, that will create much more authentication across the browsing web and that will make it so that UID can be end-to-end without the thinking problems that cookie has and those thinking problems going away would create a much more personalized Internet. And again, because we go from the 12 million ads available every second, down to the 1 million that we buy, if there\u2019s identity on slightly fewer of those, or in some cases, slightly fewer, but the signal is much, much stronger and reliable, that can be an upgrade. So there\u2019s a whole bunch of room for upgrades. As it relates to your OpenPath question, I would say I\u2019m not really seeing the same thing that you\u2019re describing in terms of the obstacles. There\u2019s lots of discussion around the way that we integrate. There\u2019s lots of discussion around priority because many of the companies that are in the ad-funded CTV space are trying to enhance their ad-funded options, and they\u2019re working very quickly to try to enhance those. The amount of pressure on streaming companies, I would say is at an all-time high right now, to grow and to grow profitably and to fund the content. And so often, they\u2019re looking at ways to create more efficiency and OpenPath creates a more efficient supply chain. So something where there\u2019s a more efficient supply chain so that they take home a greater percentage of an ad dollar is a very important next step in the evolution of CTV and streaming.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Kelley with Stifel.\nMark Kelley: Great. And I will stick to one since we\u2019re over time here. But Jeff, I wanted to ask you about if you\u2019re seeing any impact from the MediaMath bankruptcy? And any other thoughts on share gains, whether it\u2019s from competing DSPs or Laura mentioned verticals that you think maybe you under index? Any color there would be great.\nJeff Green: Yes. So we definitely see some impacts to our business. So let me first just say, MediaMath is essentially exponentially smaller than we are. So it\u2019s not a huge lift, but there are definitely some benefits. One of the first places was with employees. We have a lot of respect for what they had built and they did a lot of things right. And they also had some different perspectives on some things that we did. So we\u2019re excited to have added a few people from the MediaMath team to our company. There\u2019s also been some cases where there\u2019s business upper grabs. In some cases, we won that business outright. But what most advertisers do, especially those that were running anything sizable on MediaMath is they run a process. They test a variety of platforms. They put together a crawl, walk, run plans with each of them. And I think we\u2019re benefiting from that as much as anybody in the space or in the world. But as a result of those sort of deliberate crawl, walk, run efforts, I anticipate that it will be a sort of slow increase where we\u2019ll once again see benefits come at all different paces, but we expect to win more business as a result, especially in next year.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Mark. And John, can you please close the call out?\nOperator: Absolutely. This concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.+",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laura Schenkein",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. For nearly the past 10 years, I've experienced firsthand all of the incredible work from The Trade Desk teams around the world that produce our outstanding performance that have enabled us to manage the right balance between strong growth and significant profitability. I'm proud to present our results today and going forward. With that, on to the numbers. As you've seen in our results, Q2 was a strong quarter. Revenue was $464 million, representing growth of 23% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year was about 24.5% on a year-over-year basis. Visibility and advertiser sentiment continued to improve throughout the quarter, and we continue to gain share as marketers increasingly focus their investments on areas where data is deployed effectively, where AI and decisioning produce high ROI and where results are measurable and transparent. Our growth continued to be driven by the shift of budgets to connected TV and increasing use of retail data. Because of our objectivity and our connectivity to nearly every major CTV content provider, our platform is the most eligible for the tidal wave of demand as it shifts away from linear and walled gardens. In retail media, many of the largest retailers around the world are now our partners and more and more brands and agencies are taking advantage of this powerful data in their campaigns. We also continue to benefit from the trust we've built with our clients, launching innovative products in the interest of the demand side, paving cleaner path to supply and cultivating industry-wide support for improved identity solutions like UID2 and EUID. During the second quarter, growth was broad-based across channels, verticals and regions. CTV led our growth from a scaled channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum again in retail media as we launched integrations with more retailers and won incremental shopper marketing budgets. International spend growth accelerated off a strong Q1 with notably strong performance in CTV. And with the launch of Kokai in early June, we are well positioned for the second half of the year and 2024 as visibility and advertiser sentiment improve. With the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $180 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 39% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance throughout all our financial statements as was the case again in Q2. This outperformance led to free cash flow of $119 million in Q2. Our unique ability to generate meaningfully positive EBITDA and cash flow continues to put us in a strong position as we look ahead and invest in the critical areas of the business that will drive our growth in the years to come. This is an area I'm intently focused on, making certain that our productivity and efficiency remains best-in-class as we scale as we manage both industry-leading growth and significant profitability. I believe this is a critical factor to our success in the next phase of growth. From a scaled channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q2 and international represented about 12%. We are pleased that international Growth slightly outpaced North America for the second quarter in a row. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel more than doubled compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover. Automotive was strong once again with growth accelerating each month during the quarter due to share gains and recovery. We also saw strong performance in home and garden and food and beverage, while shopping and business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still opportunity for us to gain share in most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q2 were $305 million, up 22% year-over-year. There are ample opportunities to achieve significantly more leverage within our operating expenses. However, our primary objective remains on growing spend on our platform and grabbing land. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, included realized costs from our 2022 hiring ramp, infrastructure investments and return to office expenses. Because we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the last few years, we're in a strong position to continue innovating for clients, growing our teams and widening the distance between us and our competitors. Income tax expense was $27 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $139 million or $0.28 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $128 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $119 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 92 days, up about 1 day from a year ago. DPOs were 76 days, up about 3 days from a year ago. In Q2 via our share repurchase program, we repurchased and retired 595,000 shares for an aggregate repurchase amount of $44 million. We exited the quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $485 million, which would represent growth of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend, which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q3 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q3 of this year would be about 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $185 million in Q3. In closing, we're extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. I've always seen the immense opportunity this company has. And frankly, that opportunity has never been clearer than it is today. We have a large and growing addressable market in front of us. We have a business model that's proven to generate strong top line growth in addition to significant profitability and cash flow. With growth drivers including CTV, retail media or international business, a strong identity strategy, a 2024 U.S. election year cycle, and a significant product upgrade with Kokai, among others, we remain highly optimistic about our future as we move through the second half of 2023 and into 2024. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Thanks, Jeff, and Shyam, thanks for the question. In terms of our investments for the second half of 2023 and going into 2024, I'll start off just the big picture and then get into the specifics of what we're seeing. So just always remind myself that we've got the great luxury of high growth, profitability and cash flow. And we've been responsibly managing our headcount, OpEx growth and investments for many years now. So in the first half of 2023, we grew revenue in the 20% range. And we just guided to continued growth acceleration in revenue when you exclude U.S. election spend that we saw in the same period in 2022. So from my perspective, we're in an enviable position, while many of our other peers have struggled. So when I look out at the rest of 2023, I just look at how we're being very deliberate in our investments and in our hiring, and we still expect headcount to grow this year, but roughly at half the rate of last year, which implies around 20%. And that sets us up very nicely for 2024, just as I remind everyone that our people are our largest area of investment. We're also investing heavily into our platform and our products, specifically in areas like CTV and our forward market product and in retail media. And as we're doing this, we're focusing heavily on productivity and efficiency with all of our teams from our engineering teams to our go-to-market, business, sales AM and trading teams to make sure that we believe that all of our teams are firing on all cylinders. For this year, we also expect CapEx to be lower than last year. So last year, we came in with around $80 million of investments. And I'd expect that to be around $60 million in 2023. And just a reminder, our CapEx levels include all of our AI investments, and we don't expect any significant step-up in investments that you may have seen in some other firms. So just to sum up and as it relates to our modeling, as we've seen in the past, when we outperform on the top line, that usually drops down to the bottom line as happened in Q1 and Q2 of this year. And we're very comfortable with where things stand and cautiously optimistic about our business for the rest of the year. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Justin. On linearity in June and July, we've seen visibility improve as the year progressed. And we continue to see improving trends throughout Q2, where we saw our revenue growth accelerate to north of 23% year-over-year from around 21% in Q1. We exited June on a great trajectory, and that's continued so far in Q3. So we expect a strong Q3 for the same reasons that we outperformed the rest of digital advertising over the last few quarters, which is that we're continuing to see strong growth in CTV, in retail media and in international spend, all of which have been accretive to us this year. So I believe we remain \u2013 are well positioned for the second half of 2023 and even further out as we move into 2024."

            "content": "Thanks for the question, Shyam. I'll go first, and then I'll just hand it over to Laura to talk about investments and expenses. So it's not news to anybody here that the last 2 or 3 years have been a few years of uncertainty and unpredictability for most advertisers and most of the Fortune 500. As a result, I'm extremely excited by the change in sentiment that we've seen in Q2 and see already in Q3, where CMOs are doubling down on what's driving growth there's an understanding, of course, that the markets have begun to recover, and there's more certainty than they've had in the past. But they've also come to rely on data-driven advertising during that time of uncertainty as a place for certainty and for results. So we're seeing lots of shifts due to what they've experienced in the last few years in CTV. And then, of course, this massive secular tailwind that comes from retail data as well. As I've said before, I believe ultimately, the shape of the Internet changes dramatically as a result of CTV and retail media. And then, of course, we've also seen some amazing results as a result of UID2 adoption. You might have caught during the prepared remarks that Warner Bros. was kind of the last of the U.S. independent CTV players to adopt UID2. So now, in a way, UID2 has the full collection here in the United States, and that has become the common currency to monetize CTV in the ad environment. We expect that trend to continue, and we're seeing more and more of that. For the second part of your question for me, 2024 is looking like the tidal wave of opportunity that is both daunting as well as just massive in terms of what an incredible chance this is for us to once again grab land. So let me first just talk about some of the backdrop for 2024. So there's been a lot of pressure on Google over the last few years as it relates to antitrust as well as privacy. Of course, there's a balance between those 2 that a few years ago, there was a lot more pressure on the privacy side of that. Today, there's a lot more pressure on the antitrust side of that, which we think overall makes the market a bit more fair and makes it easier to predict Google's decisions. It also makes it so that they are undoubtedly going slower and that creates opportunity for us to once again grab land. I have said over and over again that linear television is not going to be a steady decline. It ends with an explosion. It's going to have a pretty steady, then accelerating decay. And then there's a point where it stops being worth it for anybody to operate in the space. You've kind of got a glimpse of this when Bob Iger was saying 3 weeks ago on CNBC, that he's unsure about ABC's future and their linear business model being broken, but of course, that streaming and the studios are very important to the future of the business. That business model is really talking about legacy linear and broadcast television and that, of course, the future is streaming. That represents one of the many opportunities for us in 2024. Now as our opportunity to demonstrate the power of decisioning, which is really what our brand new product release Kokai is all about. We also have some major advances going into next year as it relates to the forward market. But when you add CTV retail media, Kokai, UID2, OpenPath, international opportunities, political, the list goes on and on. Of course, Disney announced today that they'll roll out ad-supported models internationally for Disney+. We think that's one of many opportunities around the world for us as it relates to CTV. So the secular tailwinds just keep piling up, but very excited about all that. I'll turn it over to Laura to talk about investments and expenses. You bet, thank you. So let me first explain one of the reasons why I think it's so exciting what's happening in shopper marketing. So of course, many retailers have been sitting on amazing data where they know what's actually being purchased, especially for those products that you tend to buy at the store and not online so many of the products in grocery stores and pharmacies are still primarily purchased in a store rather than online. And then, of course, many of them have amazing online presences as well as, of course, brick-and-mortar off-line. So many of them are bringing their data into the ecosystem, and they've recognized that the way that they've operated in the past creates a bit of a needle in a haystack problem where you take a small amount of data and you go look in that massive ocean of 12 million ads available every single second, and you go look for the usually thousands or tens of thousands that have your data on it. And so you start with the data and you go hunting for it. Well, in this new world where things are leveraging UID from the very beginning, you get rid of the sort of 9 dominos that need to fall in the supply chain so that you can then leverage the data, but instead, you start with the data and you're actually just looking at the opportunities that match that instead of going out and looking for opportunities in that way. So by starting with the data, you make it so that you get rid of the matching problems of cookies, and you make it so that the flywheel spin faster for all of these businesses. So they're not just making additional money on a small amount of data, but they're actually selling more products across their entire company. It's actually part of the reason why I believe that the moves that were made by 3 of the most the forward-looking pioneers in the retail data space, which includes Dollar General, Albertsons and Walgreens that we're all looking for an opportunity to do something new in data. They made their data available for free so long as people will pay to use it for targeting. So their data is available for measurement so that advertisers can, without any significant opt-in or any friction, find out where they're selling products, and it's their belief as well as ours that, that will make it so that people are automatically optimizing their advertising purchases to sell products in those 3 stores. If we are all proven right, we think this represents a massive change to the way people leverage data in brick-and-mortar stores and in retail. And that just will continue to accelerate this flywheel that is spinning in shopper marketing. I just want to remind everybody that shopper marketing is not just about shopper marketing itself, it is about improving the entire funnel. So every CPG has massive amount of incremental data and insight to know where to spend their money in advertising so that they are being more effective. So all of this has the sort of a flywheel effect of improving decisioning, moving more dollars to our platform, making efficacy go up across everything on our platform. And then, of course, there is an overlap between shopper marketing and CTV where they both benefit from each other, especially because in most cases, their data is anchored off of UID2, which of course, is e-mail based in both the shopper marketing world and in the CTV world. So all of that together creates just yet another amazing secular tailwind for us in shopper marketing or retail. You bet. Thanks Justin for the question. I'll take the first part and then have Laura, you take the second. So first, let me explain what Kokai is. So Kokai is a Japanese word that means open for business or open waters. And the reason why we chose that is because we believe this is a very important moment in the open Internet to make it possible for more and more companies to build to us in a variety of ways. One of them being to sell their products. So we have value-added resellers that are selling on our product all the time, whether that's in data, whether that's in algos, there's a whole bunch of ways with \u2013 contextual data, so many ways. And then the other is then is advertisers, in particular, bringing their first-party data to the table. And so with those as the overarching mission, Kokai has really built in 5 major sort of categories or pieces. The first is massive improvement to the use of data so you'll recall, we launched Galileo earlier this year, and we also announced that Kokai, the creation of a partner portal where people can integrate to onboard their first-party data. The second is the use of AI across our platform. You'll recall that we launched AI in our platform in 2018 before it was trendy. And we called it then Koa and distributing that AI across the platform in a variety of different ways and different deep learning models so that we're using that for very specific applications rather than trying to create one algo to rule them all, if you will, which is something we actually very \u2013 in a very disciplined way, try to avoid. So that we can create checks and balances in the way that the tech works, and we can make certain that AI is always providing improvements by essentially having A/B testing and better auditability. The third thing is measurement. So first, we improved data onboarding. Second, we improved AI distributed throughout the system. Third, we improved measurement so that we can to measure the efficacy of ads, especially using retail data. We came up with a couple of new ways of measuring, which is the Retail Sales Index, where we take a variety of different retailers and put all of their data together so that they're way better than the sum of the parts. And then TVQI, the TV Quality Index, we're helping advertisers see the benefit of being on premium content versus cat videos or worse that often comes from user-generated content. Then fourth, in the second half of the year, there will be a new user experience. So that's right around the corner, of course, because we're in the second half of the year. So very excited about what that means. I believe this is our biggest and most impressive U.S. upgrade ever, and it's going to create better behaviors among buyers and because it comes with much better forecasting, they'll get to see the decisions they're making and the impact before they even run, which is new. That is something much better than what we've had over the last 14 years. I'm very excited about what that means. And then last but not least is integrations for better CTV measurements and performance across the board as well. So lots to be excited about, but Kokai is our biggest relief. I expect it to be our most successful, but I will say that because this requires adoption during the busiest time of the year \u2013 because this requires a change in behavior, I don't expect there to be lots of adoption during the busiest time of the year. And so most of the benefits will be reaped in 2024 and 2025. But we're seeing a lot of the rollout of especially the first couple that I mentioned already seeing some impact already, seeing some performance enhancements. But as we go into 2024, we expect this to once again change the way that media buying is performed. Laura, do you mind taking the second half of the question? Yes. Thanks for the question. So let me first just describe a conversation that I had with the CEO of one of the publicly traded SSPs, where we were just talking about PG, or programmatic guarantees. And just talking about how he saw things. And he and I agreed that as people are moving budgets over from traditional television or linear \u2013 they are \u2013 sorry. As they're moving over budgets, from traditional TV or linear. They're often looking for programmatic guarantees as a place where they'll spend first. But as he and I both agreed, they always end with spending in decisions because decisioning is much, much better. So we've recently done some studies on decisioning across the platform and compared it to PG. And we found that the value of decisioning or the performance of the decisioning on a CPA basis is 5x better in general, or if you were to say it in terms of savings, it's an 83% save in order to \u2013 in CPA costs in order to decision. So whatever incremental tax, as you put it comes, which is usually, in our case, the 20%-ish take rate, that take rate is more than justified by the power of decisioning that comes to the table. And that's exactly why even the SSPs and their leadership are predicting that long-term things move towards decisioning, but the PG is an on-ramp. We sometimes compare it to a freeway, where it's an on-ramp and you get on the freeway. But if you stay on the on-ramp, you're doing it wrong. And so that's what we see happening. That's what we think the SSPs see happening, but there will be some moves in the very short term towards these premium PMPs that are centered around especially programmatic guarantees that long term, we think, move towards decisioning and broader data usage. Yes. So let me go in reverse order just because I think the significance of your comments around Apple is important. So any of us that operate in the Apple ecosystem are putting in our Apple ID, which incidentally is an e-mail address over and over and over again. In fact, we're not even \u2013 we don't even know why we're putting it in most of the time. You're asked to put it in. You say, why? And then you put it in. And then you're asked again and then you put it in and you are asked again. Apple has used their e-mail-based identifier to provide personalization, they have updated many of the things that they said they wouldn't do before so that they can leverage that Apple ID to provide personalization. It is exactly that, that I think provides a validation that UID2 is one of the most privacy- centric ways to provide personalization across the Internet. It's used across many of the biggest platforms and with some of the biggest companies in the world, whether that's at Amazon, whether that's at Snowflake, whether that's at Disney, there's just hundreds of companies that are leveraging that, which of course, is based on an e-mail address not dissimilar from the massive empires at Google and Apple, which are also built around e-mail-based identifiers. So I don't think the comparison that Apple is allergic to them is fair because their entire ecosystem is built on an e-mail-based identifier. As it relates to the public administrator of UID2. Honestly, it's not that important. Most of our integrations are done privately. Of course, we were happy to hand it off and look for the right public administrator, as it continues to scale and as if it comes to a more pressing issue, but it hasn't been yet. We want to make certain that somebody that is that public administrator, of course, shares the vision of protecting the open Internet. And at times is willing to stand up and do the right thing even if it's not popular. That can be very difficult to find. And so that's something that we'll be very deliberate about, but it has not slowed down anything in not having that. So we're not in any rush to change the status quo. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. So the reason why we benefit from cookies potentially going away in the form of UID2 is that we have been saying to advertisers, every advertiser needs to have an identity strategy. We've been saying to publishers, every publisher needs to have an identity strategy and an authentication strategy. And by authentication, we mean there needs to be some way that you're encouraging people to log in. And in the case that you have log-ins, finding some way to leverage them. Very few companies on the Internet are leveraging their log-ins to provide personalization to the level that they could be. And there certainly hasn't been much effort to leverage those outside of their own ecosystems or to make it possible for those that are bringing advertising demand to leverage the authentication on those particular publishers. If cookies were to go away, the need for that goes up dramatically and so for many of the publishers \u2013 and we saw this with GDPR, we saw this with the IDFA movement. There are many publishers that are saying, \"oh, well, wait until I have to. I'll wait to make changes until I have to.\" When they have to, they will make changes quickly. We saw a fire drill around GDPR among publishers, where they were very quickly working to create the right personalization again. And again, I just want to remind everybody what's at stake here. Think of how many print journalism companies have struggled to stay in business due to the Internet. And if you take their CPMs where they get a significant amount of revenue from $5 per ad to $2 per because relevance goes down, then they no longer can stay around. And that's why I say that cookies going away poses a threat to journalism. But that would make it so that they're very quickly leveraging those log-ins. And when you're saying, \"Oh, I get to see 1 out of 3 articles before I have to pay.\" I think you'll see a lot more of authentication at the beginning of almost every website, not dissimilar from if you go to a furniture or clothing website today. The very first thing you see is type in your e-mail address, you'll get 10% off. If you type in your e-mail address, only then will you get access to content, that will create much more authentication across the browsing web and that will make it so that UID can be end-to-end without the thinking problems that cookie has and those thinking problems going away would create a much more personalized Internet. And again, because we go from the 12 million ads available every second, down to the 1 million that we buy, if there's identity on slightly fewer of those, or in some cases, slightly fewer, but the signal is much, much stronger and reliable, that can be an upgrade. So there's a whole bunch of room for upgrades. As it relates to your OpenPath question, I would say I'm not really seeing the same thing that you're describing in terms of the obstacles. There's lots of discussion around the way that we integrate. There's lots of discussion around priority because many of the companies that are in the ad-funded CTV space are trying to enhance their ad-funded options, and they're working very quickly to try to enhance those. The amount of pressure on streaming companies, I would say is at an all-time high right now, to grow and to grow profitably and to fund the content. And so often, they're looking at ways to create more efficiency and OpenPath creates a more efficient supply chain. So something where there's a more efficient supply chain so that they take home a greater percentage of an ad dollar is a very important next step in the evolution of CTV and streaming. Yes. So we definitely see some impacts to our business. So let me first just say, MediaMath is essentially exponentially smaller than we are. So it's not a huge lift, but there are definitely some benefits. One of the first places was with employees. We have a lot of respect for what they had built and they did a lot of things right. And they also had some different perspectives on some things that we did. So we're excited to have added a few people from the MediaMath team to our company. There's also been some cases where there's business upper grabs. In some cases, we won that business outright. But what most advertisers do, especially those that were running anything sizable on MediaMath is they run a process. They test a variety of platforms. They put together a crawl, walk, run plans with each of them. And I think we're benefiting from that as much as anybody in the space or in the world. But as a result of those sort of deliberate crawl, walk, run efforts, I anticipate that it will be a sort of slow increase where we'll once again see benefits come at all different paces, but we expect to win more business as a result, especially in next year."

            "name": "Jeff Green.",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release, we posted very strong growth in the second quarter. We reported revenue of $464 million growing 23% compared with last year. This also represents an acceleration in our growth rate compared with the first quarter. And just like the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. What's particularly notable about our performance is that most advertisers are still dealing with some degree of uncertainty in their business. Even though certain macro indicators are improving, there's still a sense from many advertisers that we are in an unpredictable environment. For them, it's hard to dismiss what we've been through over the last 2 to 3 years with the global pandemic, rampant inflation, supply chain crises and banking system uncertainty, and of course, global rebalancing. None of these market dynamics have been very predictable the last few years. And this year, like the last few, has similarly had lots of never-before macro events. So while many indicators and advertiser sentiments are improving, there's also a sense that it's more difficult than ever to predict what's coming next. But in this environment, marketers have learned that data-driven precision can bring a sense of certainty and reliability to their advertising efforts. Because of the innovations we brought to market in areas such as retail media, CTV, identity and data, advertisers have a clearer sense than ever of the performance and impact of their ad campaigns. And with Kokai, we are delivering even more innovation, all in service of helping advertisers drive precision, relevance and certainty in everything they do. As a result, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing more multiyear joint business plans, or JBPs, with leading agencies and brands representing spend projections in future years well into the billions of dollars. Our relative outperformance over the last few quarters means we have gained more market share than in any other period in our company's history. Advertisers have become more deliberate with their spend and have increasingly gravitated to our platform and as they understand more about the power of programmatic, they are choosing the objectivity and performance of our platform over the murkiness of walled gardens more than ever before. Even as we continue to grow and scale around the world, we see no deviation from our 95%-plus retention rate. Our clients rely on us more and more. I was at the Cannes Advertising Festival a few weeks ago, and I could have filled my calendar several times over with brand CMOs, agency leaders and CEOs of our key partners, all of whom want to understand how we can work more closely together. Every year, demand for the value that we deliver continues to grow. Perhaps what's most interesting right now is how marketers are seeking a sense of certainty in an uncertain environment. Much of the product rollouts and partnership growth we've seen this year is because we're giving our clients certainty and reliability that they can't get elsewhere. This shows up all over our client base and all over our platform, but I'd like to talk today about a few places where the certainty and reliability is really driving our relative outperformance particularly in retail media, CTV and identity. By discussing these 3, I believe it will provide some insight as to why we continue to outperform the market, why I believe we'll continue to outperform the market and why we continue to invest in our platform with all the innovations coming from Kokai. So first, let me talk about retail media, which has become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business. Much like CTV, our rapid growth in retail media starts with our focus on objectivity. Retailers know we're only here to serve advertisers and to drive more precision and efficacy in ad campaigns. We don't compete with them. And like all of our partners, retailers know, we are careful and objective stewards of their data. As you know, Walmart was one of the first early major retailers to understand the power of their data and to help advertisers understand and measure the connection between campaign spend and actual consumer purchases. For many advertisers, there's no clear measurement of performance than that. You can look at all kinds of traditional marketing KPIs, but there's nothing more powerful than knowing that a consumer bought your product because of the ad you serve and then using that data to improve marketing spend in the future. One of the great recent examples of this is Fruit of the Loom, working with our agency, GSD&M, Fruit of the Loom wanted to reach new and existing customers to increase sales with a back-to-school promotion. They were targeting a 200% return on ad spend, or ROAS, working with the Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk, they were able to predict audiences with much more precision and were able to understand in real time, how ads in different channels were performing. They could then shift campaign dollars to those channels that were actually driving consumer purchases. This clear line of sight helps Fruit of the Loom vastly exceed their campaign goals, delivering a 1,200% return on ad spend among existing customers and more than 1,000% ROAS with new customers. Eric Mahoney is Fruit of the Loom's Digital Marketing Manager. He said, and I quote, historically, we've done a really good job of reaching our brand purchasers. But working with the Walmart DSP allowed us to reach that new consumer through predictive audience segments. We could not have achieved these results without Walmart DSP and The Trade Desk.\" He also said that working with The Trade Desk is like putting on a fresh pair of underwear. Of all the accolades we've received over the years that is definitely one of my favorites ever. The gravitational pull of retail media is not limited to the U.S., retailers around the world are working with The Trade Desk in different ways to unleash the power of their data to help advertisers bring more value to their campaigns. In Singapore, we partnered with FairPrice, the largest grocery chain there with 570 stores serving 90% of the country's population. One of the first brands to leverage FairPrice shopper data on our platform was Coca-Cola, who wanted to reach customers during the festive Lunar New Year season. They also wanted to be able to measure the performance of low-funnel marketing outreach across multiple channels, including OTT, audio, digital out-of-home and of course, open Internet display. The campaign tapped into FairPrice's audience segments via our platform, targeting Fair-Price customers who had purchased Coke or other Coke products over the past 1 to 3 months. They were able to target seasonal shoppers who purchased festive products and optimize in real time to the news and lifestyle channels that delivered the best results. With their agency, EssenceMediacom, Coke was able to drive 189% uplift in sales during the campaign. They were also able to measure consumer reaction in a range of new ways, including the time it takes for a consumer to buy a product following different kinds of ad exposures, audience engagement from different channels and cart values offirst time and repeat buyers. The retail media opportunity is also growing exponentially for us in Europe. In recent quarters, we've talked about our partnerships with leading retailers such as Ocado and Tesco. And just a few weeks ago, we announced a partnership with Europe's largest retail group, Schwarz, which includes major brands such as Kaufland and Lidl. From an advertising perspective, retail media is something that's really taken off over the last 2 years. It's no coincidence that the growing interest in retail media coincides with growing advertiser focus on authenticated ad environments. With retail media, advertisers can start with precise authenticated data whether that data is based on purchase history or loyalty data. From there, the advertiser can target based on what they know and then do more accurate data-driven modeling to expand targeting segments with greater precision Some of the same dynamics are behind the rapid growth of CTV advertising. As we have all seen in recent weeks, there is a ton of focus right now on the business model of TV. What is the future of the linear TV model? And how does the TV industry create sustainable, profitable business models for streaming TV as viewers shift there in mass. I believe the answer will come in fully exploring the authenticated viewer data that sits at the core of the CTV ecosystem, which is something that today's leading media companies are exploring. For the past couple of years, CTV has been one of our fastest-growing channels at scale. There are a range of reasons for that. Fundamentally, video remains the most effective way for brands to influence the hearts and minds of consumers. And with CTV, brands can apply data to their TV campaigns and measure with much more precision, the effectiveness of every ad dollar. And much like retail, advertisers value the authenticated audiences that come with CTV, pretty much every streaming TV viewer is logged in with an e-mail address. For advertisers, this means more certainty. It also creates a new starting point centered on data. These dual forces of retail and CTV are truly bringing the power of data-driven decisioning home for advertisers, and it is accelerating their shift to programmatic on our platform. Whereas in the early years of programmatic, we were looking to find ways to affix data to campaigns. Today, we use data as a starting point for campaigns. Instead of hunting for ad opportunities with data, The Trade Desk and marketers are starting with data to know which media opportunities we should hunt for. It's a different dynamic and it's one that's become more prominent as advertisers seek more certainty in an uncertain and unpredictable environment. As I said, media companies generally understand the value of authenticated user data. And this is a major reason why the top streaming companies in the U.S. have pretty much all integrated with UID2 or are planning to. The latest was Warner Bros. Discovery, who announced at Cannes that they will integrate UID2 across all of their streaming properties, including Max and Discovery+. The broad embrace of UID2 across the CTV ecosystem has been driven in part by a key economic factor. Streaming leaders need to unleash the value of their authenticated data for advertisers in order to create as much precision and relevance as possible, thereby maximizing their CPMs. In order for the streaming business model to thrive and for media companies to keep pace in the content arms race, they need to maximize advertising revenue. As we have seen with every streaming platform launching an ad-supported service, a subscription based approach is not enough. And the only way to maximize advertising revenue is to increase precision and relevance. With UID2, the advertiser can start with authenticated data, enrich that with their own and third-party data and then where they can find the right relevant audience, they will pay a meaningfully higher price. As Tim Sims outlined during our Investor Day, where advertisers are able to bid with certainty based on relevance and precision, the value of each impression increases significantly, generally, exponentially. Ultimately, this is how we will answer some of the vexing questions that have been swirling around the TV industry recently. And while we are still in the early days of the CTV advertising revolution, I'm confident that emerging innovations on our platform, such as a forward market for CTV advertising will only accelerate advertisers' ability and appetite to fund this amazing new golden age of TV. It's also worth pointing out that this is an increasingly global trend. At Cannes this year, for example, we announced a new partnership with RTL, one of the largest pan-European media companies. Through this partnership, our international advertisers will have exclusive programmatic access to RTL's addressable linear and connected TV inventory. We are starting with inventory across Germany, Spain, France and Austria with more European markets to follow soon. This represents our most significant step yet into the European CTV market. It's also indicative of how the major European media companies are keeping pace with changing viewer preferences and advertiser demand to meet viewers where they are and where they are most leaned in. As many of you have seen, we had a lot to say about retail and CTV during our recent Kokai launch. And I'd just like to take a moment to put that in perspective. Because as advertisers increasingly prioritize CTV and retail, it's critical that we continue to innovate in our platform so that we surface value for our users as intuitively as possible. One way Kokai accomplishes this is with a series of new indexes or benchmarks that help advertisers understand and measure performance. In the retail arena, we launched the Retail Sales Index. The RSI helps advertisers understand the impact of their retail media spend across multiple retailers at once. In this way, we are massively reducing the complexity of measuring ad campaigns that run across multiple retail data sets. Now advertisers can understand which retail environments perform better at different times, in which channels, for which kinds of creatives, all in 1 place. And in doing so, we are providing a level of objectivity and measurement from the bottom of the funnel all the way to the top, that is simply not possible within a walled garden. In addition to that, we also announced a few pioneering retailers who are making retail measurement available for free in our platform if the advertiser has activated their retail data for targeting. These retailers include Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons. This is a major step forward in bringing the full value of retail media to bear in service of greater precision and certainty. In the CTV space, we launched the TV Quality Index, or TVQI. As the CTV advertising market has multiplied in terms of inventory, there are some who would have you believe that a piece of user-generated content has the same quality in the eyes of the viewer as professionally produced content or live sports. Yes, I know there are some UGC influencers who have millions of followers that some brands may target from time to time. But that's a very small slice of UGC. The vast bulk of it is very unattractive, and sometimes even unsafe for brand advertisers. The TVQI helps advertisers understand the value of the impressions they are buying in the context of the quality of the content those impressions are served against. The index shows that for every 10-point improvement in quality there is a 15-point improvement in conversion rates. Sometimes it's even higher than that. And for our own campaigns for The Trade Desk, in the second quarter of this year, as we were beta testing TVQI, we found that a 19-point increase in the index score resulted in a 50-point improvement in our conversion rate. If you're a marketing leader, these are substantial performance improvements. I mentioned those two elements of Kokai because they're important to understand in the context of CTV and retailer as more advertisers gravitate to CTV and retail because they offer more certainty in starting advertising campaigns based on authenticated audience data, these Kokai innovations provide more certainty through the course of the campaign in terms of measurement and performance optimization. Of course, there are many other aspects of Kokai that we unveiled on 06/06, some of which are live and many of which we will be launching in the next few months. These indexes and other innovations, especially around the application of AI across our platform are helping us surface value more intuitively to advertisers. We are revamping our UX so that the campaign setup and optimization experience is even more intuitive with data next to decisions at every step. And we're making it easier than ever for thousands of data, inventory, measurement and media partners to integrate with us. In doing so, I believe that The Trade Desk will become an essential innovation hub of the open Internet. I'd like to end on this point because I think it's important to reiterate that there are many things we do at The Trade Desk that are not in our immediate business interest. UID2, for example, is an innovation we devised about 3 years ago and promptly gave it away to the industry. We're seeing broad adoption across the data and inventory ecosystems of the open Internet and accelerating use by advertisers. In many ways, the industry is looking at innovations like UID2 as a core element of the flight to certainty that is driving a lot of advertiser action today. If an advertiser has certainty that they are reaching the right person across all channels, they will prioritize that ad buy. CTV and retail are major advancements in this regard, but UID2 is a major building block of this new cross-channel identity fabric too. This is particularly important as there has recently been a lot of speculation regarding the potential demise of third-party cookies in Chrome in early 2024. A lot of this speculation reminds me of the frenzy in 2017 when Safari deprecated cookies or more recently in 2021 when Apple made its IDFA changes. Each time I have stated that none of this will have a significant material effect on our business, and that was true. I've said many times that I'm not sure that it's in Google's best interest to get rid of third party cookies because of the harmful impact it will likely have on publishers that have not implemented a strong identity strategy. But while it matters a lot to many browser-based publishers, in the long run, it really doesn't matter that much to us. Advertisers will increasingly select ad opportunities where they can act with certainty and leverage their own data. That's why I've spent so much time today talking about CTV, retail and UID2 as they have become essential building blocks of the open Internet. On the supply side, we developed OpenPath, to provide our clients with a direct transparent path to inventory. This is just the latest effort by the Trade Desk to improve supply-side transparency and objectivity and we now have thousands of destinations across the open Internet, integrating with OpenPath. And when advertisers see an OpenPath channel to inventory, they are more likely to select it versus the 8 to 10 alternative paths to that same impression because there's more certainty. And now integrating with UID2, OpenPath or any number of other innovations or offerings on our platform is easier than ever with Kokai. We believe that to truly optimize the value of the open Internet, there are many ways in which the industry needs to innovate together. So we can provide advertisers as an ecosystem with more certainty, transparency and objectivity. In recent weeks, we've heard even more about the alleged dubious behavior of walled gardens, whether it's from the European Commission or independent research reports. Advertisers and media companies are increasingly aware that they need to work with technology partners who represent their interest, not conflicts of interest. As a result, advertising dollars are shifting to our platform. And we will continue to invest in our platform and push the industry to create even more value for advertisers on the open Internet. Our recent outperformance is not a temporary blip, I believe it is the start of a reassessment of the value of the Internet, particularly from an advertiser's perspective, and I could not be more excited about the growth opportunity that is in front of us in the years ahead as a result. And with that, I'll hand it over to Laura to cover our financials."

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good day to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; Chief Financial Officer, Blake Grayson; and Executive Vice President of Finance, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements. Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Chris and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release, we are off to a very strong start in 2023. We reported first quarter revenue of $383 million, representing growth of 21% compared with last year, again exceeding our own expectations. And has been in the case in the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We are gaining market share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Even as most brands and advertisers continue to deal with some level of uncertainty, they are increasingly shifting more of their campaign dollars to decision, data-driven opportunities, where they can have more confidence that those dollars are working as hard as possible. As a result, we are signing multiyear joint business plans, JBPs; with the leading agencies and brands, some of which represent spend projections that exceed $1 billion. From the beginning, our goal has been to align our incentives with the buy side. This continues today. Because we do not own any media and because of our unwavering commitment to the demand side, our clients trust that we represent their interest alone and we continue to innovate our platform to bring maximum value and ROI for their brand and agency campaigns. With that in mind, I'd like to focus my comments today on a few key areas. First, CTV; second, AI, including generative AI; third, agility; and fourth, the combination of OpenPath and identity. So first, the transformational impact of CTV. In the first quarter, video which includes CTV, was the fastest-growing channel of our business. And our CTV growth is not just here in the United States. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. As I've said before, the shift to CTV is driving significant change, not only in TV advertising but also in omnichannel advertising. In other words, our whole business. Many campaigns are now starting with high-value CTV impressions with carefully monitored reach and frequency. As part of an omnichannel campaign, these impressions are then followed up with less expensive display, audio, mobile and native ads to move the user down the funnel. The focus on the transformational nature of CTV is never more apparent than at this time of year as major networks work to sell as much of their inventory as possible in advance through the annual spring upfront process. As the upfronts kick into gear, the role of programmatic CTV advertising is increasingly top of mind for our agency and brand clients. In recent years, upfronts have been charging higher CPMs for less reach in broadcast TV which only serves to assign more clarity on the value of digital and CTV. Add to that, the current writers\u2019 strike undoubtedly time deliberately and we expect more dollars to flow into the spot market, programmatic and decision TV. As a result, I expect CTV to play a more central role than ever in this year's upfront. Rave [ph] summarized recent trends in an article a couple of weeks ago that I quote, \"Advertisers are requesting new deal terms with the major streaming TV companies ahead of this year's spring ad haggle, including how brands spend through programmatic platforms.\" In some cases, brands and agencies are asking streaming publishers to let The Trade Desk be a part of the deals. The shift to decision CTV was reinforced at our recent Forward '23 CTV event in New York City, where most of the major streaming media companies joined us on stage to talk about how they are innovating in CTV to bring value to the world's top advertisers. Paramount talked about how advertisers are incorporating data, identity and optimization into the upfronts. Disney spoke about the multiyear transition taking place in CTV, much of it hinging on advances in addressability made possible by CTV. Also at Forward '23, NBCU made the big announcement that they have adopted UID2. They are integrating UID2 in order to ensure a premium CTV experience with low ad loads and frequency controls for advertisers. Across the board, UID2 is accelerating as the primary currency or CTV decisioning. As we've discussed previously, biddable marketplaces are inevitable for media companies to maximize demand and compete in the CTV content arms race. This only becomes more true as the streaming wars intensify each year. By the way, this also makes integration with The Trade Desk somewhat inevitable for all major streaming platforms as they scale because they need as much demand as possible to their platforms. Even Netflix, a company who just launched their advertising business model at the end of last year, highlighted on their earnings call a few weeks ago that the ad-funded subscriber is more valuable to them than the ad-free subscriber. Hulu has said the same thing for years. Even in the early days of the market, ad-supported streaming is proving to be the most effective engine for growth and value and that is even before Netflix brings the power of identity and biddable marketplaces to the table. With a critical mass of premium CTV inventory available across a wide range of platforms, our advertising clients are eager to embrace the power of decisioning in their TV campaigns and many of them are working with us to drive new innovations in CTV to get the maximum value from their investments. Recently, we launched a new product, The TV Quality Index, or TVQI for short. It helps advertisers understand the quality of the ad experience that the consumer is having. The index analyzes consumer perceptions of different streaming platforms, ad relevance and publisher signals to ensure that each campaign targets the most relevant inventory to any specific audience group. It also helps advertisers compare the impact of premium video against the C of UGC skippable ads. One of our large independent agency clients, Tombras recently ran a campaign for one of their large global banking customers. Tombras wanted to understand how CTV could help increase brand awareness and favorability. With TV QI, Tombras was able to see where increases in the index score drove meaningfully higher brand lift. In this particular campaign, Tombras was able to drive a 22.5% lift in awareness and a 17% improvement in favorability by focusing on high scoring inventory from HBO Max and Discovery Plus based on TVQI. The TV inventory quality is particularly important to advertisers when thinking about premium CTV content compared to the user-generated video content that often characterizes walled gardens. This was a priority for Sinyi Realty, one of the top real estate companies in Taiwan for an omnichannel campaign that they recently ran on the trade desk. Sinyi wanted to boost its business by reaching more sellers and they had previously relied on social media marketing against UGC. With The Trade Desk, however, Sinyi was able to significantly expand targeted reach and improve performance with an omnichannel campaign that embrace CTV, online video and display advertising, allowing them to maximize precision and optimize frequency across all those channels at once. Sinyi onboarded their valuable first-party data, leverage UID2 to find new target audiences and use third-party behavioral data to find people interested in real estate and related topics, including consumers who had recently purchased home decoration products. With this approach, Sinyi was able to significantly expand their target audience, outperforming every one of their key KPIs. Indeed, Sinyi's video advertising assets performed twice as well as their previous GC campaigns. I think it's also worth noting that while we spend a lot of time talking about the transformational nature of CTV, Sinyi's experience is a typical one of many of our clients. As I mentioned before, CTV is often just a starting point. Very few advertisers execute in CTV alone. Almost all of them want to bring decisioning to their TV spend so that they can be more data-driven across all advertising channels and the emergence of premium CTV inventory at scale now enables that omnichannel optimization. Next, I'd like to talk about artificial intelligence and our focus on innovation. AI has always been a very strategic focus of The Trade Desk and we're confident that once again, we're in a leading position. In our original business plan, we said that our technology had to be a fusion of human and machine. Our initial products reflected that paradigm. Humans are often best at creating hypotheses, especially about how to emotionally connect with other people, something that is key to the success of any advertising campaign. At the same time, machines can often test those hypotheses and constantly learn from new data. In 2018, AI was deployed throughout The Trade Desk product in enough places that we launched a brand that year, Koa. To our users, Koa denotes the presence of TTD's proprietary AI learning technology that generates recommendations and optimizations. When we launched Koa in 2018, we used the analogy of the copilot, where our thousands of daily users are the pilots and our generative AI recommendation serve as their copilot. More and more of our users have these features turned on as a default because they know that they're getting AI-driven insights and optimizations constantly applied to their campaigns. I love what the CEO of Coca-Cola said publicly after their earnings a few weeks ago. And I quote, \"Much has been said about AI and it's certainly going to abate the maxim. Profound transformative technology is often overestimated in its impact in the short term and underestimated in the long term. This is going to have a profound impact, profound internally for the way our business operates but also how we engage with consumers.\" He then added, \"I think AI is going to make a huge impact in marketing.\" With that in mind, not enough has been said about what it takes to make great AI. ChatGPT is an amazing technology but its usefulness is conditioned on the quality of the dataset it is pointed at. Regurgitating bad data, bad opinions or fake news, where AI generated deep bases, for example, will be a problem that all generative AI will likely be dealing with for decades to come. We believe many of the novel AI use cases in market today will face challenges with monetization and copyright and data integrity or truth and scale. By contrast, we are so excited about our position in the advertising ecosystem when it comes to AI. We look at over 10 million ad requests every second. Those requests, in sum, represent a very robust and very unique dataset with incredible integrity. We can point generative AI at that dataset with confidence for years to come. We know that our size, our dataset size and integrity, our profitability and our team will make Koa and generative AI a promising part of our future. In the future, you'll also hear us talk about other applications of AI in our business. These include generating code faster; changing the way customers understand and interact with their own data; generating new and more targeted creatives, especially for video and CTV; and using virtual assistance to shorten the learning curve that comes with the complicated world of programmatic advertising by optimizing the documentation process and making it more engaging. We'll have a lot more to say about the role of AI, particularly how it is getting more distributed within our system as well as many other game-changing innovations at our Net Platform Launch event on 66 in New York. It will be the largest platform launch in our history and I even hesitate to call it an upgrade because it is so much more than that. It will encompass a new approach to collaborative innovation, breakthroughs in how we service value for advertisers and expanding accessibility as marketers of all types embrace the power of programmatic. The new release is called Koki and we look forward to sharing new product announcements new ways for partners and clients to adopt and integrate with The Trade Desk and even deeper relationships as a result. For the third topic today, I'd like to talk briefly about agility. In our work with the thousands of agencies and brands that utilize our platform, there has been a shift in the discussions we're having over the last 12 months or so. All of our clients are cognizant of the macro market environment, whether it's high interest rates or fears of recession, the stability of the banking system or ongoing supply chain issues. They are also, though, keenly aware of the role that advertising continues to play in helping them drive growth and differentiate their businesses even in times of uncertainty. Because of this, marketing leaders need to be deliberate with advertising budgets. More and more, they are looking to understand where they can shift investments and where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven to find those important opportunities to differentiate and drive growth to their business. And in that environment, the value of The Trade Desk becomes even more apparent. With us, agencies and brands can plan and optimize in real time. They can work in month-to-month increments versus a yearlong or a 6-month plan. A great example of this is FairPrice in Singapore. You may remember that FairPrice is one of our retail media partners. They are the largest grocery chain in Singapore. They are also an advertiser on our platform. Their goal was quite simple. In an increasingly competitive market, FairPrice wanted to reach new customers with a lower acquisition cost. Working with The Trade Desk, they were able to import their valuable first-party data from their loyalty program which comprises more than 2 million customers. Using UID2, they were able to do look-alike modeling to understand where additional potential customers might be targeted, potential customers who share some characteristics of their most loyal customers. And the results were very impressive. When using UID2 to execute that modeling, FairPrice's acquisition cost per customer was 1/3 lower than with traditional identifiers but also with twice the scale. The same trend is happening around the world. One of the world's largest CPG companies, also one of our largest clients, recently highlighted this on their earnings call. They talked about how programmatic was helping them drive significant campaign and media efficiencies, maximizing the ROI of every campaign dollar. This efficiency helped them reinvest in more media and innovation, driving competitive differentiation. The trend towards agility and flexibility plays into the strengths of The Trade Desk. In fact, I would argue that at a time when it can be harder than ever to predict macro market trends, the ability to drive a growth and competitive differentiation agenda using our platform becomes more compelling than ever and we expect this trend to continue regardless of the macro environment. More and more marketing leaders from CMOs to agency leaders, to media planners understand the power of programmatic to thoughtfully drive value. And they are leaning in, whether it's in CTV, retail media, UID2 or any number of other key programmatic innovations. Finally, I'd like to discuss UID2 in the OpenPath. I've mentioned UID a few times on this call already but I'd like to touch on the progress we've made there and with OpenPath in the last few months as well. Much has been written about these innovations in recent weeks, especially about what they might mean for the evolving role of demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms. As I hope you picked up in the client stories I've shared today, UID2 is much more than a new identity alternative to cookies. It's really about helping our clients drive advertising precision in a privacy-safe way across all advertising channels. As the open Internet continues to grow and evolve, it's essential that we develop new identity currencies that help us preserve the vital value exchange of relevant advertising or free content. Last quarter, I said we expect 75% of the third-party data ecosystem to be activating on UID2 by the middle of the year. I'm proud to report today that we are now right at that level with most major third-party data providers leveraging UID2s on our platform. A growing number of publishers are also sending UID2, providing advertisers with greater insight into audience engagement and campaign performance. And as a result, ad spend is increasingly gravitating towards ad impressions that include UID2. It's worth noting that, in some cases, we may see the same ad impression from up to 8 or 9 SSP supply paths on our platform. When this occurs, our clients are more likely to transact on impressions that incorporate UID2 because they have a clearer sense of exactly which audience they are reaching and how those ads are performing. A few weeks ago, for example, Unilever announced that ad impressions, including UID2, on Disney were 12x more effective in reaching their target audience than those with traditional identifiers. This is not atypical and our advertisers are willing to pay for the value of that precision. Indeed, CPMs on ad impressions containing UID2 are meaningfully higher than those without in most channels. In this way, UID2 simply helps advertisers drive as much value as possible from every advertising dollar. The same can be said of OpenPath. To begin the discussion on OpenPath, let me first remind you of what it is. OpenPath is a direct integration from our platform into publisher inventory. It provides our clients with a direct line of sight into premium inventory across channels and it provides publishers with a direct view of what advertisers are willing to pay for their impressions. In no way, shape or form is OpenPath an effort by the Trade Desk to enter the supply side of digital advertising. That is not in our interest. To explain that a bit more clearly, it's worth spending a moment on some of the industry dynamics that make OpenPath compelling for our clients. OpenPath was born of an advertiser interest in having a more clear and transparent path to publisher inventory, where every participant in the supply path is contributing more value than they are extracting in fees. Advertisers have long been aware that there are quite a few hops in the advertising supply chain and neither the price nor the value of each hop has ever been completely clear. We share this concern. And in this way, OpenPath, is very consistent with our long-term commitment to make supply chain optimization and efficiency a reality. Advertisers' eagerness for more transparency came at a time when publishers were becoming increasingly frustrated in their ability to manage yield in the complex world of programmatic. Indeed, many of them were starting to do it themselves, with some even launching their own ad servers. And why were they frustrated? It really has a lot to do with Google's dominance of the supply side and the draconian measures they've taken that hurt publisher revenues. The recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google does a remarkably thorough job of outlining these dynamics. We have long asked the supply side to do a better job of yield management. It's not something we will ever do. We see the impact that Google is having and we believe DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP should have more and better competition from SSPs just as we try to provide on the demand side. But given the state of the supply chain in programmatic which is one where either companies have the power to create change and don't want to or they are too small to have the power to create the change, advertisers want direct integrations and publishers are welcoming them. Many publishers representing thousands of media properties across CTV, mobile and display have already integrated with OpenPath. And our advertisers are increasingly prioritizing direct channels, where they have a clear view of value. For all of the publishers that have integrated, we have a multiple of that number going through the process of getting on board right now. So let me bring this all to a close by highlighting that our work in these areas is made possible by our focus on profitability. In the first quarter, once again, The Trade Desk generated strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We remain one of the very few high-growth technology companies to consistently do so year after year. Our strong profitability allows us to invest in emerging technologies such as OpenPath and UID2 and deliver them to market, even if development resources are in short supply across our clients and partners. It means we can continue to invest in innovations such as our retail media marketplace, enabling our clients to more effectively measure how specific campaigns drive in-store or online purchases. Just a couple of days ago, we announced a new retail partnership with Macy's here in the United States. In Europe, we recently announced a new partnership with Ocado, a joint venture involving Marks & Spencer and one of U.K.'s fastest-growing grocery groups. We now work with many of the world's leading retailers to activate their data for our advertisers and our clients are embracing the opportunity to apply more performance and measurement precision to their retail campaigns. In many cases, this is incremental market opportunity for us. It also means we continue to advance our industry leadership in AI which I mentioned earlier and which we will talk about more on June 6 with the launch of Kokai. Our commitment to industry-leading innovation underpins everything we do. In the first quarter, we once again outperformed the market with 21% revenue growth, meaning we continue to gain market share at an impressive pace because we consistently bring innovation value to our clients every single day. The innovation acceleration in programmatic will only continue in 2023 and as more advertisers embrace breakthroughs in CTV, retail, identity and so many other areas. The Trade Desk will stay at the believing edge of this innovation curve. And in doing so, I'm optimistic that we will continue to outperform the market, deliver more value to our clients than we extract and gain share. As I hand over the microphone to Blake Grayson, I'd like to underscore an announcement that we made in our press release. I'm so thrilled to announce the promotion of Laura Schenkein to become our new Chief Financial Officer succeeding Blake, who will be leaving the company for a senior finance role outside of the ad tech industry. First, I'd like to thank Blake for the amazing contribution that he's made to this company during his time here in the last few years. I can't imagine having been through this with anyone else, never expected to experience the effects of the pandemic, some very difficult decisions in the middle of 2020 around resource allocation as we were looking into uncharted territories and lots of uncertainty. But I am extremely excited to announce Laura as our new CFO. Laura and I have worked together for about the last 10 years. I've seen Laura grow as a leader. I think it's fair to say that one of the most significant achievements of Blake during his time here is how much he has mentored and helped Laura to grow. Laura understands our business and on a personal note because I worked with Laura for a decade. I've come to trust for strategic counsel and her recommendations. I'm very proud to call her my partner and our new CFO. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake to say a few words and cover our financials.\nBlake Grayson: Thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. And good afternoon, everyone. I am immensely proud of our achievements as a company and it has been an honor to work with Jeff and the leadership team as well as so many talented individuals at The Trade Desk. I'm leaving for a new challenge knowing the company is well positioned for the future. Laura is an extremely well-respected and accomplished colleague and has my full confidence as she assumes her new role. Now on to our results; Q1 was an exceptional quarter of financial performance and execution for The Trade Desk. Q1 revenue was $383 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Our Q1 performance was bolstered by the growing trend toward unbiased, data-driven advertising on the open Internet. This shift has played to the strength of our platform as marketers become more agile and deliberate with their digital advertising. While some macro uncertainty in the market has led to relatively uneven ad budgets, we are seeing increasing numbers of marketers embrace our platform to take advantage of our flexible and data-driven approach. Our success in Q1 was demonstrated by several key achievements. Our performance in the CTV space remains robust and we continue to achieve strong momentum in retail media, further solidifying our position as a leading player in the industry. Strong growth returned to many of our key international offices. The growing adoption of UID2 by major advertisers and publishers speaks to the value that is placed on identity in the open Internet ecosystem. In addition, we deepened our partnerships with clients by expanding our joint business plans on a global level, a testament to our unwavering commitment to providing outstanding value and results for our customers. In addition to strong top line performance, in Q1, we generated $109 million in adjusted EBITDA or 28% of revenue, exceeding our own expectations. As it typically occurs, when we outperform on the top line, it generally flows through to our bottom line results as it did in this quarter. This outperformance led to record free cash flow of $177 million in Q1, marking nearly $500 million in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis which is nearly 10x the free cash flow we generated just 3 years ago. In the current environment, our consistent ability to grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow puts us in a strong position to continue investing for growth and grabbing land while others are forced to pull back. Additionally, I am proud that our robust cash generation allowed us to return excess capital to shareholders for the first time via our share repurchase program. In Q1, growth was broad-based across channels. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected TV continued to be a core driver of our business. From a scaled channel perspective, video which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America accounted for 88% of our Q1 spend, with international representing the remaining 12%. We're pleased to report that international growth slightly outpaced North America during this period, with particularly strong performance in EMEA. Our CTV business in Europe grew well into the triple digits year-over-year in Q1. While CTV growth in North Asia also showed encouraging momentum, with year-over-year CTV spend growth in both regions improving each month. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. As customers seek to optimize their ad spend, The Trade Desk is well positioned to deliver value and drive ROI as we demonstrated in late 2020. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q1 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the pandemic. Food and drink, automotive and home and garden were also among our strongest performing verticals, while shopping in business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses; excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q1 were $293 million, up 41% year-over-year. We continue to invest prudently in our team during the quarter to support our long-term growth objectives. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, was partly due to in-person events and travel that did not take place in Q1 of the prior year as we had not yet fully resumed back to office work or in-person events. Unlike many ad-funded and technology peers, we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the past few years, maintaining a focus on profitable growth. As a result, we are well positioned to capture market share and increase spend while generating significant adjusted EBITDA. Our income tax benefit was $19 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $114 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was a record $188 million and free cash flow was a record $177 million in Q1. DSOs exited in the quarter were 88 days and DPOs were 72 days. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In February, upon review of our capital allocation strategy, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program. In Q1, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $293 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities. Before I pass the microphone to Laura to cover the outlook for Q2, I'll summarize by saying The Trade Desk is off to a fantastic start in 2023 with strong momentum across the business. Our robust business model and solid balance sheet have positioned us well to succeed in the current environment with powerful secular trends such as the shift from linear to CTV the growing use of data and marketing campaigns and significant long-term growth drivers such as CTV, retail media, joint business plans and gaining share in international markets, we are highly optimistic about the potential to continue growing and capturing market share in the years ahead. And with that, I'll hand it over to Laura.\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Blake. And thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. I'm incredibly excited to be taking on the CFO role starting next month. I feel fortunate to have worked with Blake these last 3.5 years. It's because of his and Jeff's mentorship that I feel well prepared to take the baton and build upon the strong foundation they've set for CTV's future. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $452 million which would represent growth of 20% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year would be about 21% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $160 million in Q2. As Jeff has outlined, with the large addressable market in front of us, we see significant growth opportunities and continue to invest thoughtfully in the business. We continue to be one of the few technology companies capable of consistently generating high top line growth, significant adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as platform renovation, customer service identity and supply chain optimization. In addition, this year, we remain focused on hiring to support future growth, although at about half the rate of 2022 as we expect our year-over-year headcount growth to continue to decelerate as we progress throughout the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shyam Patil with Susquehanna.\nShyam Patil: Congrats on the strong performance. And Laura, congrats to you. And Blake, all the best. I just have one question. Jeff, we're hearing a lot about walled gardens starting to open up and this is something that you've talked about for a while now. Could you just talk about what you're actually seeing on this front? And how you think about the benefits and the timing of benefits to Trade Desk from this move?\nJeffrey Green: Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the kind words and also the question. So let me start by just restating something that I've said many times over the years. I do not believe the walled garden strategy is a good long-term strategy for anyone. That includes even the biggest, the Googles and Facebooks and Baidus, Alibabas and Tencents [ph] of the world. But it's especially bad for the smaller walled gardens. And there are a lot of players that have been essentially comping the Google, Facebook playbook and creating friction to buy their inventory. And as I've said before, I think that the cracks in that strategy or in those walls show up in proportion to size and they're the result of sort of economic pressure that when you have more supply than demand, you want to welcome more demand and not make it harder to buy your inventory. So it's natural that in an environment where there's a lot of pressure and, certainly, the advent of CTV makes, so there's more options in the open Internet than there's ever been before that, that puts pressure on all walled gardens but especially those that are smaller. So you might be commenting on a number of specific companies who've been more public in the market, talking about how they're opening up. And they're using phrases like \"We're opening to other demand.\" And that's very exciting for us and I do think that's indicative of what's to come. One thing I just want to encourage everybody to do, though, is to scrutinize the type of demand that they're opening up when inventory is available in price discoverable ways, where we can bid on it and understand exactly what we're bidding and not just plug into an API and transfer budgets but to actually know what we're buying and do what we do in the rest of the Internet and with our core business. That is extremely exciting to us. When you can layer on top of an identity which, of course, we're going to talk more about in UID undoubtedly, that also creates just opportunity for higher prices for them, more price discovery for us and that's the sort of everyone wins situation. And we're seeing more and more talk about moving in that direction. We're seeing some movements heading in that direction. I'm very optimistic that, that will continue. But right now, there's a lot of early discussions and that's just the byproduct, I think, of just some of the economic pressures and the alternatives and also the advent and success of UID2. So all of that together, I think, is really creating yet another secular tailwind in our favor. So very excited about it and appreciate the question, Shyam. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\nJustin Patterson: Great. I'd also like to issue my congratulations to Laura and best wishes to Blake. My question for Jeff. There's a perception that shopper marketing is just a new form of targeting. Could you express your views on this? And just how measurement in the approach to marketing efficacy has changed with this approach versus that retargeting model of the past?\nJeffrey Green: Thank you, again, for the kind of words. And I really appreciate this question. If I do this well, I can avoid writing another offense because this is something that's been on my mind for a little while. And I'm just -- I'm so glad you've asked the question. So those that have argued that shopper marketing is just a new form of retargeting don't really understand the significance of what is happening in shopper marketing. So if you, first of all, sort of visualize the purchase funnel, where at the top, you're creating awareness, it's also where most of the surface area of the funnel is and at the bottom is where a purchase gets made. Retargeting is a small sliver in the middle of that purchase funnel, where somebody has expressed interest with the shopping cart. They filled it out but then they didn't actually purchase. And so then you -- if you do it badly, the way often our industry does, you just harass the person until they buy it. If you do it well, then you do that in a metered approach. But it is just a small sliver of the marketing budget that is spent to get the customers that almost got to the finish line but didn't. Shopper marketing is the entire funnel. It is a new segment that widens the entire funnel, where, first of all, you're able to measure all the way to the very bottom of the funnel. So you're able to see who actually went to Walmart and bought the razor. And if they did buy the razor, now it can look alike model and go find 100,000 people that look just like them. And then I go create new awareness and I move them down the funnel. Will retargeting be a part of that? Of course, just like all the other effective parts of the purchase funnel. But the real beauty of shopper marketing is that you're creating new look-alike modeling at the very top of the funnel to find 100,000 people or more. They just like the people that bought the product and then you're able to measure all the way down to the bond and say these are the people that actually bought the product. And that last piece that has been missing, there's been a whole lung of proxy metrics and measurement that has been used to argue, especially from walled gardens that they're the ones that have driven all the sales and this is really the first and very best way at scale to say we're selling product that is directly related to the marketing that we've been doing before. So if you're anything that sells product in brick-and-mortar and I don't want to suggest that it's isolated to brick-and-mortar, it's not, you can do the exact same thing online but there's just such a strategic pressure on those that are in brick-and-mortar. When you think about, for instance, Walmart or Target, we were both partners, of course, trying to compete with Amazon, that the way that they leverage their strengths in being a brick-and-mortar, where Amazon mostly isn't, is for them to see how they can take off-line measurement and apply it to online marketing and complete the entire purchase funnel and quite literally widen that purchase funnel. Lastly, I just want to underscore that in a very short amount of time, this has been -- this has become a big part of our business, not only does it widen the TAM but we just have amazing success stories with Walmart and Target and Walgreens and Albertsons and Kroger and then so many others, the flyboys, the boots, so many others around the world. But I'm very excited about our most recent announcement just a few days ago with Macy's, where so much of what we've been doing is in grocery stores and convenience stores and those types, albeit all over the world, including like the GoJets of Indonesia and just so many others. But Macy's is the first time that we're really getting into more clothing and fashion and a totally different part of the economy and we expect that partnership to continue to pay dividends for years to come; so very excited about it. I really appreciate the question because it is so much more than simply retargeting, so I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. Thanks for saving me.\nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research.\nVasily Karasyov: Wanted to ask a question about OpenPath and SPO. When I read the industry blogs and press. It seems like the peering DSPs and SSPs against each other's competitors. There is a narrative we talk about each player trying to disentimidiate and charge the other players. So it seems very hostile environment in the industry right now according to the industry press. So Jeff, could you provide us your view on what really is going on there and where we're going with respect to supply chain optimization here?\nJeffrey Green: Absolutely. Thank you for the question. It's funny. The last one I said, thanks for saying in Open, almost done with the open in this one which will come out early next week on the current. But I really appreciate the question because I do feel like there's a phenomenon here that feels a little bit like reality TV or something, where there's just so much effort to create drama in our space including in places where there is in drama, that I appreciate the chance to clarify. So let me just reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks. OpenPath is a product that directly integrates with publishers and content owners so that they can see the demand that we're bringing. It is not us getting into yield management, where we're providing the service to publishers and content owners to get them the highest CPM possible. Because for the most part, we're trying to get lower CPMs on behalf of buyers. They want the best value which is they want something that's going to perform and give them great brand equity but they want to pay as little as they have to, to get that. That's for the most part, the exact opposite of what publishers want. So we can't play both sides without creating the conflict of interest that we're extremely critical of in walled garden. So we wouldn't sign up to go do that, given how public we are in our criticisms of those that try. And so -- but I will say that the supply chain of digital advertising is extremely convoluted and there's lots of inefficiencies and complexity. I think it's one of the most complicated supply chain of any scaled market in the world. And I do believe that it's impossible to talk about this topic without talking about Google because they often sit in the middle, largely because of the technology that was formerly called DFP that now is part of GAM, Google Ad Manager. That, according to the Department of Justice lawsuit, has almost 90% market share. So when they have that sort of market share and they have a business model that is deliberately opaque, it becomes very difficult to see what everyone else is doing. So there are a number of initiatives to create greater transparency. You've heard about a clear line from Magnite potentially. You've heard about a new product Pelotenticate from Pragmatic. But really, what everybody is trying to do is create clearer supply chains and make it so that there are less hoops and duplication, that every single impression is running through. When I say everyone is trying to do that, I think those that are being loudest and those that are biggest. There are, of course, players in the supply chain that are trying to exploit the opaqueness and there are small players and big players trying to do that. And so what OpenPath does is it creates a baseline to compare all those against. Over time, we'll continue to make certain that we don't spend on paths that are less efficient and OpenPath gives us that benchmark or that baseline to make certain that we don't do that. And we think, over time, those that are trying to do the right thing and create a more effective supply chain, they're going to be rewarded by our efforts and their efforts to be more transparent and more open about what we're buying and selling. But this is not us trying to compete with the sell side. This is not us declaring more on the sell side. We are declaring more on inefficiency. We are declaring more on those players that are trying to do the wrong thing. And honestly, it's hard on some days to tell who's trying to do the right thing and who's doing the wrong thing. So we just developed the technology that exposes the math that makes certain that price discovery wins, that make certain that people are passing the metadata so the price discovery can actually happen. Because on a significant amount of impressions, it doesn't. And over time, you're going to see us just continue to reward those players that enable price discovery and punish those that don't as it relates to where we take our business. But I expect the supply chain to continue to get more effective. OpenPath is a critical part of that. We're excited to have the support of most of the scaled, open Internet ad tech. And every now and again, there's something critical written in the press. And honestly, I think that's often them looking for drama. And I think they've learned over time that if you write something about The Trade Desk, you get clicks. But that's different than what's actually happening sometimes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist.\nYoussef Squali: And congrats on the solid quarter. Blake, best of luck. And Laura, congrats on the new assignment. So Jeff, on AI, I think we can all see the potential impacts on content creation, ad copy, A/B testing, et cetera, et cetera. I'd love to hear your thought as to how AI is likely to potentially impact the competitive landscape within your industry. Does that give a potentially competitive advantage to those that have been investing in the technology maybe a little longer than others? And how are you guys, in particular, how is Trade Desk kind of inserting more and more of the new capabilities into your product road map?\nJeffrey Green: Amazing. First of all, thank you so much for the question. If I could have chosen the questions today, I probably would have chosen those similar to this, I probably would have moved AI actually up. I'm almost shocked that we got through 3 questions without talking about AI, so I'm so excited to talk about it. I've never seen a topic that is so hot or hotter than what AI is right now, not cloud, not blockchain. I don't even know that dot-com 20 years ago was hotter than AI is right now. So I'm excited that we're talking about it but this is not a new topic for us. So first of all, when we first wrote our business plan, we talked about how this was the fusion of man and machine. And the analogy that we used in the very beginning was that a pilot and copilot, where human beings are often good at creating hypotheses and especially given that we operate in an industry that is about essentially predicting and influencing human behavior but there is always an opportunity for human beings to create the emotional and make it an emotional appeal. But after you do that, there, of course, is a role for machines to play. And following the data and learning, revising those hypotheses and iterating, testing blue creative versus the red creative. And of course, blue and red in terms of the different types of creative have evolved into all different types of generative AI, where creatives can do a whole bunch of different things. There's so much opportunity for AI to play a significant role. You may also recall that when we launched a new product in 2018 that we call it Koa and it was our AI solution that helped advertisers to optimize campaigns on our platform. We -- in fact, they use the analogy of copilot which, of course, Microsoft is using today as their analogy to help engineers write code which incidentally, I think, is one of the most interesting ways that people are actually monetizing AI. Almost all the discussion about generative AI is on things that I think are going to have difficulty in actually monetizing. The copilot of Microsoft, I think, is an opportunity to actually monetize and I think it will help our team write code faster. But there is a couple of things that I just want to highlight but I do not believe are happening in a public discussion adequately today. The first is there's this mindset of winner take all and that there's Google versus Microsoft way of looking at things and I just don't think that's the right paradigm. I think we should look at AI like very expensive code. It is expensive to write and it is very expensive to process. It takes more compute power. And because the reason it's more expensive to write is partly because of how complicated it is and the implications, especially of generative AI. So because it's very expensive to both write and to execute, it is an opportunity for bigger companies or at least those that are profitable to do very well. And the fact that we have been operating so profitably for so long puts us in an amazing position. Additionally, there is this topic of the quality of our data sets. And I just want to remind everybody that the Internet has been struggling for a very long time with the concept of truth. Think back to like social networks in the last election cycle and how much discussion was spent on fake news and all these topics that really center around truth. Now that you're able to crawl so much of the Internet to generate essentially artificially intelligence-driven opinions. It is very difficult to figure out what is true. It's even harder than before and I wouldn't say that the Internet did a phenomenal job before. So now of where we're all sitting is we're looking at the datasets that we rely on and say how good are they because the AI will never be better than the quality of our data sets and that is the reason why I think we are in a phenomenal position because so much of the data that we're looking at is, number one, something that we get directly from the data source itself. So we're listening to every ad request on the open Internet. And from that, we have essentially a pure dataset that we can reach conclusions on. We're not scraping user-generated content. We're not scraping the comments section of every website on the Internet, where there's just tons of falsehoods and inaccuracies. We are looking at what people actually read, what they actually listen to, what they actually are interested in and we're able to create conclusions and pair them with UID and have massive datasets that we then can use to make more informed decisions. That creates opportunity for us to play a huge role in the future of AI in advertising. And just to rattle off a few ways that, that can have -- can play a role in our business. We can have an AI assistant for traders and essentially create a better ability to talk to the data. We can automate the building of ad groups and campaigns to find the audiences to make recommendations. We can do a better job of creating not just internal information-seeking, where you write a search query. Although we can, of course, make it easier to query but we can also do a more personal job of summarizing that. And maybe the thing that I'm most excited about is a creative generation, where we can create more variety but also we can make it really easy to create, add especially for video and CTV, for medium and even smaller businesses that I think can lower the barrier to entry for us to move from not just the biggest advertisers in the world but to many, many others, where the friction can be reduced. Those are just a couple of ways that I think AI is going to play a substantial role. I'd just remind everybody that Thomas that I quoted from the CEO of Coca-Cola in the prepared remarks. I think that captures very well and just another opinion that I have on the topic. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of why we're thinking about this so much, why we have been investing really from the very beginning, why we launched Koa in 2018 and why we continue to iterate on it. Thanks so much for the question.\nOperator: Next, we have Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: Jeff, I'll ask one. How are you thinking about the benefits to advertisers from using Trade Desk offering for connected TV PMP or kind of like the upfront product versus what the SSPs are pitching? Is there kind of PMP but they're their kind of direct product? And then kind of what the downside risk would be to the publisher from either solution?\nJeffrey Green: Yes. So there is this opportunity for buyers to look across all reach and frequency and all the different places that they buy and summarize that all in one place and that is one of the benefits that the Trade Desk brings to the table, is that people tend to come to us and say, \"I need to have a holistic view.\" And because CTV in particular, is fragmented, as I've said before, perfectly, meaning that it's not too small that there's millions of websites, we have dozens of outlets but it's not too aggregated so that we only have one place to buy which is not that dissimilar from what search is, where you buy from one place or what much of social is. So by having it fragmented, that makes it so needing somebody to look across, everything becomes very important. Now in the cases where you're buying programmatic guarantees or you're buying at a fixed rate and you're not controlling frequency across all these different things, then you lose a lot of the benefits of programmatic. And in fact, you lose decisioning. So what is sometimes happening is people are buying at a fixed rate. They're going to the seller and saying, \"Hey, in the short term, I don't need to control reach and frequency. I don't even care about decisioning. I'll let you, the seller, decide which impressions I get. I just need to move this over from broadcast or traditional television into the digital ecosystem.\" And in that, given that you've sort of weakened the value proposition of programmatic, it is a bit of a jump haul. You could do that with an SSP or a DSP because you've gotten rid of all the benefits or the best benefits of programmatic. So that's where others are stepping up and saying, \"If you want to, you can temporarily use us to buy directly.\" But even if you listen or read closely in, for instance, what Comac [ph] announced in the last couple of days, authorize the same, while people are just moving dollars over, we want to help them move them over. But we do believe that in the medium and long term, this will be very good for DSPs. And what they're acknowledging is that as soon as somebody wants to be holistic about the buy and they want to compare this buy to something else, that they have to use a DSP in order to do that. And so because we're so convinced that the very best of programmatic and really what's in the best interest of buyers is for them to participate in decisioning, not to give that away to the sell side but for them to participate in decisioning. And while sometimes that means they have to pay a little bit more, including to us, that decisioning and what we bring to the table is always worth it. And so it's because of that belief that I believe that the SSPs are highlighting that in the medium and long term, the buyers are going to gravitate to the places where they have decisioning. But in the short term, when people are just trying to move over from essentially an insertion order and not control any amount of decisioning and just do so with sort of dumb pipes, that can be done with us over somebody else. Advantage to do it with somebody else, it is they might be able to save a point or 2. Advantage is doing it with us is they'll have a more holistic view. But we think both medium and long term, they're going to end up going to a place where they can decision holistically. And we think that means they end up with us, especially in the world of CTV.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\nTim Nollen: I've got a CTV-related question as well. I was listening to the Disney call just before your call started here. And Bob Iger said some very interesting things related to CTV and programmatic, I mean, including saying that they've added 1,000 new advertisers using programmatic. 1/3 of them are -- 1/3 of advertisers are trying programmatic. They're talking about their pricing tiers, seeing the value of programmatic ads in driving advertising revenue for them for their ad-supported tier and so on. My question then is, given the Forward market event that you had a month or 2 ago and the talk -- the conversations you've had, Jeff, with both sides, maybe if you could just give us a bit of insight into how you're working with -- is it Disney? Or if you don't want to talk about Disney, specifically other network groups as to how to get them to offer more of their ad inventory inhabitable format, not just doing the insertion orders and if this is something that you're participating in actively in the upfront market which is due to start next week.\nJeffrey Green: Absolutely. I really appreciate the question and I heard some of those remarks before I jumped over, of course, to focusing on ours and we're very excited by the remarks that Bob made. Let me first just say I'm so proud of our partnership with Disney and what we've done there. I'm also excited about the fact that both Paramount and MBC announced their adoption of UID2 in Q1. So as it relates to all the major content owners in the United States, everyone now has spoken publicly about their adoption of UID2. And I think all of this, whether Bob's comments or the adoption of UID2, is a commentary on the state of streaming competition. So -- and actually, the numbers with Disney are also a commentary on that. They're trying to grow but also be profitable and there's a lot of pressure on the current environment and on cost. So what that means is that people need to do more with less. And especially the content owners, they need higher CPMs so that they can fund all the content and make the same money that they've been making as people continue to make more and more content and the market gets more competitive. The only way to do that is to make the ads more relevant and more effective for the advertisers. The only way to do that is to leverage same-site UID and transparency and biddable marketplaces so that we can participate and get that increased value. What we're most excited about is all of these are moving more towards biddable. So in light of what we just said in the last question when we were talking about how -- when people don't want decisioning, then they can use dumb pipes to execute that. That's not in anyone's best interest long term because advertisers need efficacy, the publishers need higher CPMs. The only way that, that works is in a highly-decision, highly data-driven biddable marketplace. And that means that everybody is moving into a biddable environment. When we look at all the things that we talked about in our Forward '23 event as well as we look at what's happening going into the upfront and honestly, the fact that the upfronts are -- sort of have this cloud over their heads of the writers\u2019 strike, I actually think helps us and connected TV because that amount of uncertainty makes it so that people are more likely to say, \"You know what, I'll just buy it in the spot market.\" And the spot market is programmatic. And that's great for everybody, to be honest, because it means a biddable data-driven ecosystem. But what the themes that we keep hearing is that, they want the ability to activate their data. I mean advertisers want the ability to excite their data. We're seeing them buy on value more and more and not on price and that often means that they're willing to pay a premium for decisioning. In fact, in our Forward event in from Hershey's, I think articulated this about as well as anybody can. And in this economic environment, we're seeing more and more people gravitate towards flexibility and having the ability to adjust. And when you add that cloud of the writers\u2019 strike, you also add just economic uncertainty. And then you, of course, add in biddable, you have the ability to bring data to the equation, that makes it so that everybody is looking more and more to programmatic as its future. And I think when Bob Iger underlines that, I think it becomes easier for everybody to believe that in the marketplace. So I was excited by his comments. I appreciate your question.\nOperator: Next question is from Matthew Cost [ph] with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Chloe [ph] on for Matt. Just as we think about OpEx leverage throughout the year, are there any areas that you would call out in the second quarter and going forward, where you're looking potentially to gain a little bit of leverage in the model? And then second, on the key investment priorities, it sounds like you have so many exciting products and so many moving parts between CTV, the retail media opportunity, UID2, OpenPath, like there's a lot to unpack there that you're focused on. But what do you think is going to contribute most significantly to growth this year? What are you prioritizing? And then what's a little bit more of a longer-term project?\nJeffrey Green: You bet. So on the OpEx, I'm going to ask Laura and take the first part of it and then I'll add a little color on that and then I'll also talk about the investment opportunities or feel free to chime in on both.\nLaura Schenkein: Absolutely. Thank you, Chloe, for the question. When we look at the big picture for Q2 and the rest of 2023, we're excited. We have a great luxury. We're high growth. We've got profitability and we've got cash flow. I'm proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments over the past few years as it's really paid off. Unlike many of our ad-funded peers and other high-growth tech companies, we've responsibly managed our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. And since our revenue is still growing well in the double digits while others are contracting or in the low single digits, we intend to and can stay the course and grab share even while our peers are pulling back. So we do expect for 2023 that our operating expenses will increase year-over-year both with and without stock-based compensation and we continue to be extremely deliberate in our investments and our hiring. So our headcount will grow this year but roughly half the rate as it did last year which sets us up nicely for the rest of the year and for 2024. And on the second part of the question, we still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV, data and retail media. So as we've seen in the past, when we outperform on the top line, that usually drops through to the bottom line. We saw that in Q1. And we are comfortable with where things stand and cautiously optimistic about growth this year and say that, especially as we think about significant tailwinds in 2023, that set The Trade Desk apart from other companies and that can help offset anything we see in the macro environment. And by that, I'm talking about a strong GBP pipeline which bodes very well for future growth. CTV as a channel continues to grow incredibly fast. And in the big picture, we still have a relatively small amount of share and lots of room to grow. And then as we've been talking about retail media, we're really just scratching the surface of a $100 billion plus incremental TAM opportunity and all of that makes us extremely excited. Jeff, I don't know if there's anything you would add.\nJeffrey Green: That was amazing. Very impressive, Laura. Thank you. I don't have anything to add on the OpEx. On the investment side, I'll just add, let me first just say I am so excited about the moment that we're in right now in the ecosystem as well as just all the macro conditions that sort of frame this moment for us. And I recognize that there's lots of uncertainty and managing that day to day isn't always fun. But overall, it just creates this amazing opportunity for us and I just want to explain why. So first, we have an opportunity to continue to invest in our people and to grow our culture. So during the pandemic, managing our team and preserving our culture was really hard. Everybody was remote and things like that. It's just -- it was very difficult, in part because of the decisions that Blake and I made to make certain that we didn't invest too aggressively. We were -- we never had to do a layoff. We never had to hit the brakes too hard. And now we're in a moment where we get to continue to hire and he's really set things up well for me and Laura to continue on that path. We are hiring today. And unlike 1.5 years ago, where we were competing with every other company seemingly in the world, especially in Silicon Valley, now we're hiring from those companies and we're not competing with them at all. And so we're able to very carefully choose people because we were one of the first to come back to the office. We were -- we have a culture that's really well intact and we're hiring into that and that allows us to grow. And when you're trying to hire engineers, especially when there's this opportunity to invest like in AI, this environment and this backdrop and our history makes it an amazing time and place to invest in people. As you know, just from knowing our financials at all, like that is our biggest investment, is in our people and it is also our greatest asset no matter what the numbers say. Also I'll just say, of course, we're going to continue to invest in CTV. This is the biggest secular tailwind we may ever see in this company's history. I didn't know that another one would come along when we ran into shopper marketing. Of course, there's an opportunity for us to invest in the forward market which really has a lot to do with CTV. Of course, we're going to keep investing in UID2 and that is going to continue to pay dividends for as far as we can see into the future. And of course, when you have a strong balance sheet like ours, you get to invest in things like AI but you also get to investment in things like a stock repurchase which we started to execute on but there's more opportunity for us to do going forward; so -- just so many places for us to continue to invest. Those are some of the highlights. I'm sure I left off a dozen or more.\nChris Toth: John, you can close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeffrey Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release, we are off to a very strong start in 2023. We reported first quarter revenue of $383 million, representing growth of 21% compared with last year, again exceeding our own expectations. And has been in the case in the last few quarters, we continue to significantly outperform the digital advertising industry. We are gaining market share as advertisers embrace the precision and relevance of data-driven advertising on the open Internet via our platform. Even as most brands and advertisers continue to deal with some level of uncertainty, they are increasingly shifting more of their campaign dollars to decision, data-driven opportunities, where they can have more confidence that those dollars are working as hard as possible. As a result, we are signing multiyear joint business plans, JBPs; with the leading agencies and brands, some of which represent spend projections that exceed $1 billion. From the beginning, our goal has been to align our incentives with the buy side. This continues today. Because we do not own any media and because of our unwavering commitment to the demand side, our clients trust that we represent their interest alone and we continue to innovate our platform to bring maximum value and ROI for their brand and agency campaigns. With that in mind, I'd like to focus my comments today on a few key areas. First, CTV; second, AI, including generative AI; third, agility; and fourth, the combination of OpenPath and identity. So first, the transformational impact of CTV. In the first quarter, video which includes CTV, was the fastest-growing channel of our business. And our CTV growth is not just here in the United States. CTV continues to grow rapidly, both in EMEA and across Asia. As I've said before, the shift to CTV is driving significant change, not only in TV advertising but also in omnichannel advertising. In other words, our whole business. Many campaigns are now starting with high-value CTV impressions with carefully monitored reach and frequency. As part of an omnichannel campaign, these impressions are then followed up with less expensive display, audio, mobile and native ads to move the user down the funnel. The focus on the transformational nature of CTV is never more apparent than at this time of year as major networks work to sell as much of their inventory as possible in advance through the annual spring upfront process. As the upfronts kick into gear, the role of programmatic CTV advertising is increasingly top of mind for our agency and brand clients. In recent years, upfronts have been charging higher CPMs for less reach in broadcast TV which only serves to assign more clarity on the value of digital and CTV. Add to that, the current writers' strike undoubtedly time deliberately and we expect more dollars to flow into the spot market, programmatic and decision TV. As a result, I expect CTV to play a more central role than ever in this year's upfront. Rave [ph] summarized recent trends in an article a couple of weeks ago that I quote, \"Advertisers are requesting new deal terms with the major streaming TV companies ahead of this year's spring ad haggle, including how brands spend through programmatic platforms.\" In some cases, brands and agencies are asking streaming publishers to let The Trade Desk be a part of the deals. The shift to decision CTV was reinforced at our recent Forward '23 CTV event in New York City, where most of the major streaming media companies joined us on stage to talk about how they are innovating in CTV to bring value to the world's top advertisers. Paramount talked about how advertisers are incorporating data, identity and optimization into the upfronts. Disney spoke about the multiyear transition taking place in CTV, much of it hinging on advances in addressability made possible by CTV. Also at Forward '23, NBCU made the big announcement that they have adopted UID2. They are integrating UID2 in order to ensure a premium CTV experience with low ad loads and frequency controls for advertisers. Across the board, UID2 is accelerating as the primary currency or CTV decisioning. As we've discussed previously, biddable marketplaces are inevitable for media companies to maximize demand and compete in the CTV content arms race. This only becomes more true as the streaming wars intensify each year. By the way, this also makes integration with The Trade Desk somewhat inevitable for all major streaming platforms as they scale because they need as much demand as possible to their platforms. Even Netflix, a company who just launched their advertising business model at the end of last year, highlighted on their earnings call a few weeks ago that the ad-funded subscriber is more valuable to them than the ad-free subscriber. Hulu has said the same thing for years. Even in the early days of the market, ad-supported streaming is proving to be the most effective engine for growth and value and that is even before Netflix brings the power of identity and biddable marketplaces to the table. With a critical mass of premium CTV inventory available across a wide range of platforms, our advertising clients are eager to embrace the power of decisioning in their TV campaigns and many of them are working with us to drive new innovations in CTV to get the maximum value from their investments. Recently, we launched a new product, The TV Quality Index, or TVQI for short. It helps advertisers understand the quality of the ad experience that the consumer is having. The index analyzes consumer perceptions of different streaming platforms, ad relevance and publisher signals to ensure that each campaign targets the most relevant inventory to any specific audience group. It also helps advertisers compare the impact of premium video against the C of UGC skippable ads. One of our large independent agency clients, Tombras recently ran a campaign for one of their large global banking customers. Tombras wanted to understand how CTV could help increase brand awareness and favorability. With TV QI, Tombras was able to see where increases in the index score drove meaningfully higher brand lift. In this particular campaign, Tombras was able to drive a 22.5% lift in awareness and a 17% improvement in favorability by focusing on high scoring inventory from HBO Max and Discovery Plus based on TVQI. The TV inventory quality is particularly important to advertisers when thinking about premium CTV content compared to the user-generated video content that often characterizes walled gardens. This was a priority for Sinyi Realty, one of the top real estate companies in Taiwan for an omnichannel campaign that they recently ran on the trade desk. Sinyi wanted to boost its business by reaching more sellers and they had previously relied on social media marketing against UGC. With The Trade Desk, however, Sinyi was able to significantly expand targeted reach and improve performance with an omnichannel campaign that embrace CTV, online video and display advertising, allowing them to maximize precision and optimize frequency across all those channels at once. Sinyi onboarded their valuable first-party data, leverage UID2 to find new target audiences and use third-party behavioral data to find people interested in real estate and related topics, including consumers who had recently purchased home decoration products. With this approach, Sinyi was able to significantly expand their target audience, outperforming every one of their key KPIs. Indeed, Sinyi's video advertising assets performed twice as well as their previous GC campaigns. I think it's also worth noting that while we spend a lot of time talking about the transformational nature of CTV, Sinyi's experience is a typical one of many of our clients. As I mentioned before, CTV is often just a starting point. Very few advertisers execute in CTV alone. Almost all of them want to bring decisioning to their TV spend so that they can be more data-driven across all advertising channels and the emergence of premium CTV inventory at scale now enables that omnichannel optimization. Next, I'd like to talk about artificial intelligence and our focus on innovation. AI has always been a very strategic focus of The Trade Desk and we're confident that once again, we're in a leading position. In our original business plan, we said that our technology had to be a fusion of human and machine. Our initial products reflected that paradigm. Humans are often best at creating hypotheses, especially about how to emotionally connect with other people, something that is key to the success of any advertising campaign. At the same time, machines can often test those hypotheses and constantly learn from new data. In 2018, AI was deployed throughout The Trade Desk product in enough places that we launched a brand that year, Koa. To our users, Koa denotes the presence of TTD's proprietary AI learning technology that generates recommendations and optimizations. When we launched Koa in 2018, we used the analogy of the copilot, where our thousands of daily users are the pilots and our generative AI recommendation serve as their copilot. More and more of our users have these features turned on as a default because they know that they're getting AI-driven insights and optimizations constantly applied to their campaigns. I love what the CEO of Coca-Cola said publicly after their earnings a few weeks ago. And I quote, \"Much has been said about AI and it's certainly going to abate the maxim. Profound transformative technology is often overestimated in its impact in the short term and underestimated in the long term. This is going to have a profound impact, profound internally for the way our business operates but also how we engage with consumers.\" He then added, \"I think AI is going to make a huge impact in marketing.\" With that in mind, not enough has been said about what it takes to make great AI. ChatGPT is an amazing technology but its usefulness is conditioned on the quality of the dataset it is pointed at. Regurgitating bad data, bad opinions or fake news, where AI generated deep bases, for example, will be a problem that all generative AI will likely be dealing with for decades to come. We believe many of the novel AI use cases in market today will face challenges with monetization and copyright and data integrity or truth and scale. By contrast, we are so excited about our position in the advertising ecosystem when it comes to AI. We look at over 10 million ad requests every second. Those requests, in sum, represent a very robust and very unique dataset with incredible integrity. We can point generative AI at that dataset with confidence for years to come. We know that our size, our dataset size and integrity, our profitability and our team will make Koa and generative AI a promising part of our future. In the future, you'll also hear us talk about other applications of AI in our business. These include generating code faster; changing the way customers understand and interact with their own data; generating new and more targeted creatives, especially for video and CTV; and using virtual assistance to shorten the learning curve that comes with the complicated world of programmatic advertising by optimizing the documentation process and making it more engaging. We'll have a lot more to say about the role of AI, particularly how it is getting more distributed within our system as well as many other game-changing innovations at our Net Platform Launch event on 66 in New York. It will be the largest platform launch in our history and I even hesitate to call it an upgrade because it is so much more than that. It will encompass a new approach to collaborative innovation, breakthroughs in how we service value for advertisers and expanding accessibility as marketers of all types embrace the power of programmatic. The new release is called Koki and we look forward to sharing new product announcements new ways for partners and clients to adopt and integrate with The Trade Desk and even deeper relationships as a result. For the third topic today, I'd like to talk briefly about agility. In our work with the thousands of agencies and brands that utilize our platform, there has been a shift in the discussions we're having over the last 12 months or so. All of our clients are cognizant of the macro market environment, whether it's high interest rates or fears of recession, the stability of the banking system or ongoing supply chain issues. They are also, though, keenly aware of the role that advertising continues to play in helping them drive growth and differentiate their businesses even in times of uncertainty. Because of this, marketing leaders need to be deliberate with advertising budgets. More and more, they are looking to understand where they can shift investments and where they can be more flexible, agile and data-driven to find those important opportunities to differentiate and drive growth to their business. And in that environment, the value of The Trade Desk becomes even more apparent. With us, agencies and brands can plan and optimize in real time. They can work in month-to-month increments versus a yearlong or a 6-month plan. A great example of this is FairPrice in Singapore. You may remember that FairPrice is one of our retail media partners. They are the largest grocery chain in Singapore. They are also an advertiser on our platform. Their goal was quite simple. In an increasingly competitive market, FairPrice wanted to reach new customers with a lower acquisition cost. Working with The Trade Desk, they were able to import their valuable first-party data from their loyalty program which comprises more than 2 million customers. Using UID2, they were able to do look-alike modeling to understand where additional potential customers might be targeted, potential customers who share some characteristics of their most loyal customers. And the results were very impressive. When using UID2 to execute that modeling, FairPrice's acquisition cost per customer was 1/3 lower than with traditional identifiers but also with twice the scale. The same trend is happening around the world. One of the world's largest CPG companies, also one of our largest clients, recently highlighted this on their earnings call. They talked about how programmatic was helping them drive significant campaign and media efficiencies, maximizing the ROI of every campaign dollar. This efficiency helped them reinvest in more media and innovation, driving competitive differentiation. The trend towards agility and flexibility plays into the strengths of The Trade Desk. In fact, I would argue that at a time when it can be harder than ever to predict macro market trends, the ability to drive a growth and competitive differentiation agenda using our platform becomes more compelling than ever and we expect this trend to continue regardless of the macro environment. More and more marketing leaders from CMOs to agency leaders, to media planners understand the power of programmatic to thoughtfully drive value. And they are leaning in, whether it's in CTV, retail media, UID2 or any number of other key programmatic innovations. Finally, I'd like to discuss UID2 in the OpenPath. I've mentioned UID a few times on this call already but I'd like to touch on the progress we've made there and with OpenPath in the last few months as well. Much has been written about these innovations in recent weeks, especially about what they might mean for the evolving role of demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms. As I hope you picked up in the client stories I've shared today, UID2 is much more than a new identity alternative to cookies. It's really about helping our clients drive advertising precision in a privacy-safe way across all advertising channels. As the open Internet continues to grow and evolve, it's essential that we develop new identity currencies that help us preserve the vital value exchange of relevant advertising or free content. Last quarter, I said we expect 75% of the third-party data ecosystem to be activating on UID2 by the middle of the year. I'm proud to report today that we are now right at that level with most major third-party data providers leveraging UID2s on our platform. A growing number of publishers are also sending UID2, providing advertisers with greater insight into audience engagement and campaign performance. And as a result, ad spend is increasingly gravitating towards ad impressions that include UID2. It's worth noting that, in some cases, we may see the same ad impression from up to 8 or 9 SSP supply paths on our platform. When this occurs, our clients are more likely to transact on impressions that incorporate UID2 because they have a clearer sense of exactly which audience they are reaching and how those ads are performing. A few weeks ago, for example, Unilever announced that ad impressions, including UID2, on Disney were 12x more effective in reaching their target audience than those with traditional identifiers. This is not atypical and our advertisers are willing to pay for the value of that precision. Indeed, CPMs on ad impressions containing UID2 are meaningfully higher than those without in most channels. In this way, UID2 simply helps advertisers drive as much value as possible from every advertising dollar. The same can be said of OpenPath. To begin the discussion on OpenPath, let me first remind you of what it is. OpenPath is a direct integration from our platform into publisher inventory. It provides our clients with a direct line of sight into premium inventory across channels and it provides publishers with a direct view of what advertisers are willing to pay for their impressions. In no way, shape or form is OpenPath an effort by the Trade Desk to enter the supply side of digital advertising. That is not in our interest. To explain that a bit more clearly, it's worth spending a moment on some of the industry dynamics that make OpenPath compelling for our clients. OpenPath was born of an advertiser interest in having a more clear and transparent path to publisher inventory, where every participant in the supply path is contributing more value than they are extracting in fees. Advertisers have long been aware that there are quite a few hops in the advertising supply chain and neither the price nor the value of each hop has ever been completely clear. We share this concern. And in this way, OpenPath, is very consistent with our long-term commitment to make supply chain optimization and efficiency a reality. Advertisers' eagerness for more transparency came at a time when publishers were becoming increasingly frustrated in their ability to manage yield in the complex world of programmatic. Indeed, many of them were starting to do it themselves, with some even launching their own ad servers. And why were they frustrated? It really has a lot to do with Google's dominance of the supply side and the draconian measures they've taken that hurt publisher revenues. The recent Department of Justice lawsuit against Google does a remarkably thorough job of outlining these dynamics. We have long asked the supply side to do a better job of yield management. It's not something we will ever do. We see the impact that Google is having and we believe DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP should have more and better competition from SSPs just as we try to provide on the demand side. But given the state of the supply chain in programmatic which is one where either companies have the power to create change and don't want to or they are too small to have the power to create the change, advertisers want direct integrations and publishers are welcoming them. Many publishers representing thousands of media properties across CTV, mobile and display have already integrated with OpenPath. And our advertisers are increasingly prioritizing direct channels, where they have a clear view of value. For all of the publishers that have integrated, we have a multiple of that number going through the process of getting on board right now. So let me bring this all to a close by highlighting that our work in these areas is made possible by our focus on profitability. In the first quarter, once again, The Trade Desk generated strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We remain one of the very few high-growth technology companies to consistently do so year after year. Our strong profitability allows us to invest in emerging technologies such as OpenPath and UID2 and deliver them to market, even if development resources are in short supply across our clients and partners. It means we can continue to invest in innovations such as our retail media marketplace, enabling our clients to more effectively measure how specific campaigns drive in-store or online purchases. Just a couple of days ago, we announced a new retail partnership with Macy's here in the United States. In Europe, we recently announced a new partnership with Ocado, a joint venture involving Marks & Spencer and one of U.K.'s fastest-growing grocery groups. We now work with many of the world's leading retailers to activate their data for our advertisers and our clients are embracing the opportunity to apply more performance and measurement precision to their retail campaigns. In many cases, this is incremental market opportunity for us. It also means we continue to advance our industry leadership in AI which I mentioned earlier and which we will talk about more on June 6 with the launch of Kokai. Our commitment to industry-leading innovation underpins everything we do. In the first quarter, we once again outperformed the market with 21% revenue growth, meaning we continue to gain market share at an impressive pace because we consistently bring innovation value to our clients every single day. The innovation acceleration in programmatic will only continue in 2023 and as more advertisers embrace breakthroughs in CTV, retail, identity and so many other areas. The Trade Desk will stay at the believing edge of this innovation curve. And in doing so, I'm optimistic that we will continue to outperform the market, deliver more value to our clients than we extract and gain share. As I hand over the microphone to Blake Grayson, I'd like to underscore an announcement that we made in our press release. I'm so thrilled to announce the promotion of Laura Schenkein to become our new Chief Financial Officer succeeding Blake, who will be leaving the company for a senior finance role outside of the ad tech industry. First, I'd like to thank Blake for the amazing contribution that he's made to this company during his time here in the last few years. I can't imagine having been through this with anyone else, never expected to experience the effects of the pandemic, some very difficult decisions in the middle of 2020 around resource allocation as we were looking into uncharted territories and lots of uncertainty. But I am extremely excited to announce Laura as our new CFO. Laura and I have worked together for about the last 10 years. I've seen Laura grow as a leader. I think it's fair to say that one of the most significant achievements of Blake during his time here is how much he has mentored and helped Laura to grow. Laura understands our business and on a personal note because I worked with Laura for a decade. I've come to trust for strategic counsel and her recommendations. I'm very proud to call her my partner and our new CFO. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake to say a few words and cover our financials. Thanks, Shyam. I appreciate the kind words and also the question. So let me start by just restating something that I've said many times over the years. I do not believe the walled garden strategy is a good long-term strategy for anyone. That includes even the biggest, the Googles and Facebooks and Baidus, Alibabas and Tencents [ph] of the world. But it's especially bad for the smaller walled gardens. And there are a lot of players that have been essentially comping the Google, Facebook playbook and creating friction to buy their inventory. And as I've said before, I think that the cracks in that strategy or in those walls show up in proportion to size and they're the result of sort of economic pressure that when you have more supply than demand, you want to welcome more demand and not make it harder to buy your inventory. So it's natural that in an environment where there's a lot of pressure and, certainly, the advent of CTV makes, so there's more options in the open Internet than there's ever been before that, that puts pressure on all walled gardens but especially those that are smaller. So you might be commenting on a number of specific companies who've been more public in the market, talking about how they're opening up. And they're using phrases like \"We're opening to other demand.\" And that's very exciting for us and I do think that's indicative of what's to come. One thing I just want to encourage everybody to do, though, is to scrutinize the type of demand that they're opening up when inventory is available in price discoverable ways, where we can bid on it and understand exactly what we're bidding and not just plug into an API and transfer budgets but to actually know what we're buying and do what we do in the rest of the Internet and with our core business. That is extremely exciting to us. When you can layer on top of an identity which, of course, we're going to talk more about in UID undoubtedly, that also creates just opportunity for higher prices for them, more price discovery for us and that's the sort of everyone wins situation. And we're seeing more and more talk about moving in that direction. We're seeing some movements heading in that direction. I'm very optimistic that, that will continue. But right now, there's a lot of early discussions and that's just the byproduct, I think, of just some of the economic pressures and the alternatives and also the advent and success of UID2. So all of that together, I think, is really creating yet another secular tailwind in our favor. So very excited about it and appreciate the question, Shyam. Thank you. Thank you, again, for the kind of words. And I really appreciate this question. If I do this well, I can avoid writing another offense because this is something that's been on my mind for a little while. And I'm just -- I'm so glad you've asked the question. So those that have argued that shopper marketing is just a new form of retargeting don't really understand the significance of what is happening in shopper marketing. So if you, first of all, sort of visualize the purchase funnel, where at the top, you're creating awareness, it's also where most of the surface area of the funnel is and at the bottom is where a purchase gets made. Retargeting is a small sliver in the middle of that purchase funnel, where somebody has expressed interest with the shopping cart. They filled it out but then they didn't actually purchase. And so then you -- if you do it badly, the way often our industry does, you just harass the person until they buy it. If you do it well, then you do that in a metered approach. But it is just a small sliver of the marketing budget that is spent to get the customers that almost got to the finish line but didn't. Shopper marketing is the entire funnel. It is a new segment that widens the entire funnel, where, first of all, you're able to measure all the way to the very bottom of the funnel. So you're able to see who actually went to Walmart and bought the razor. And if they did buy the razor, now it can look alike model and go find 100,000 people that look just like them. And then I go create new awareness and I move them down the funnel. Will retargeting be a part of that? Of course, just like all the other effective parts of the purchase funnel. But the real beauty of shopper marketing is that you're creating new look-alike modeling at the very top of the funnel to find 100,000 people or more. They just like the people that bought the product and then you're able to measure all the way down to the bond and say these are the people that actually bought the product. And that last piece that has been missing, there's been a whole lung of proxy metrics and measurement that has been used to argue, especially from walled gardens that they're the ones that have driven all the sales and this is really the first and very best way at scale to say we're selling product that is directly related to the marketing that we've been doing before. So if you're anything that sells product in brick-and-mortar and I don't want to suggest that it's isolated to brick-and-mortar, it's not, you can do the exact same thing online but there's just such a strategic pressure on those that are in brick-and-mortar. When you think about, for instance, Walmart or Target, we were both partners, of course, trying to compete with Amazon, that the way that they leverage their strengths in being a brick-and-mortar, where Amazon mostly isn't, is for them to see how they can take off-line measurement and apply it to online marketing and complete the entire purchase funnel and quite literally widen that purchase funnel. Lastly, I just want to underscore that in a very short amount of time, this has been -- this has become a big part of our business, not only does it widen the TAM but we just have amazing success stories with Walmart and Target and Walgreens and Albertsons and Kroger and then so many others, the flyboys, the boots, so many others around the world. But I'm very excited about our most recent announcement just a few days ago with Macy's, where so much of what we've been doing is in grocery stores and convenience stores and those types, albeit all over the world, including like the GoJets of Indonesia and just so many others. But Macy's is the first time that we're really getting into more clothing and fashion and a totally different part of the economy and we expect that partnership to continue to pay dividends for years to come; so very excited about it. I really appreciate the question because it is so much more than simply retargeting, so I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. Thanks for saving me. Absolutely. Thank you for the question. It's funny. The last one I said, thanks for saying in Open, almost done with the open in this one which will come out early next week on the current. But I really appreciate the question because I do feel like there's a phenomenon here that feels a little bit like reality TV or something, where there's just so much effort to create drama in our space including in places where there is in drama, that I appreciate the chance to clarify. So let me just reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks. OpenPath is a product that directly integrates with publishers and content owners so that they can see the demand that we're bringing. It is not us getting into yield management, where we're providing the service to publishers and content owners to get them the highest CPM possible. Because for the most part, we're trying to get lower CPMs on behalf of buyers. They want the best value which is they want something that's going to perform and give them great brand equity but they want to pay as little as they have to, to get that. That's for the most part, the exact opposite of what publishers want. So we can't play both sides without creating the conflict of interest that we're extremely critical of in walled garden. So we wouldn't sign up to go do that, given how public we are in our criticisms of those that try. And so -- but I will say that the supply chain of digital advertising is extremely convoluted and there's lots of inefficiencies and complexity. I think it's one of the most complicated supply chain of any scaled market in the world. And I do believe that it's impossible to talk about this topic without talking about Google because they often sit in the middle, largely because of the technology that was formerly called DFP that now is part of GAM, Google Ad Manager. That, according to the Department of Justice lawsuit, has almost 90% market share. So when they have that sort of market share and they have a business model that is deliberately opaque, it becomes very difficult to see what everyone else is doing. So there are a number of initiatives to create greater transparency. You've heard about a clear line from Magnite potentially. You've heard about a new product Pelotenticate from Pragmatic. But really, what everybody is trying to do is create clearer supply chains and make it so that there are less hoops and duplication, that every single impression is running through. When I say everyone is trying to do that, I think those that are being loudest and those that are biggest. There are, of course, players in the supply chain that are trying to exploit the opaqueness and there are small players and big players trying to do that. And so what OpenPath does is it creates a baseline to compare all those against. Over time, we'll continue to make certain that we don't spend on paths that are less efficient and OpenPath gives us that benchmark or that baseline to make certain that we don't do that. And we think, over time, those that are trying to do the right thing and create a more effective supply chain, they're going to be rewarded by our efforts and their efforts to be more transparent and more open about what we're buying and selling. But this is not us trying to compete with the sell side. This is not us declaring more on the sell side. We are declaring more on inefficiency. We are declaring more on those players that are trying to do the wrong thing. And honestly, it's hard on some days to tell who's trying to do the right thing and who's doing the wrong thing. So we just developed the technology that exposes the math that makes certain that price discovery wins, that make certain that people are passing the metadata so the price discovery can actually happen. Because on a significant amount of impressions, it doesn't. And over time, you're going to see us just continue to reward those players that enable price discovery and punish those that don't as it relates to where we take our business. But I expect the supply chain to continue to get more effective. OpenPath is a critical part of that. We're excited to have the support of most of the scaled, open Internet ad tech. And every now and again, there's something critical written in the press. And honestly, I think that's often them looking for drama. And I think they've learned over time that if you write something about The Trade Desk, you get clicks. But that's different than what's actually happening sometimes. Amazing. First of all, thank you so much for the question. If I could have chosen the questions today, I probably would have chosen those similar to this, I probably would have moved AI actually up. I'm almost shocked that we got through 3 questions without talking about AI, so I'm so excited to talk about it. I've never seen a topic that is so hot or hotter than what AI is right now, not cloud, not blockchain. I don't even know that dot-com 20 years ago was hotter than AI is right now. So I'm excited that we're talking about it but this is not a new topic for us. So first of all, when we first wrote our business plan, we talked about how this was the fusion of man and machine. And the analogy that we used in the very beginning was that a pilot and copilot, where human beings are often good at creating hypotheses and especially given that we operate in an industry that is about essentially predicting and influencing human behavior but there is always an opportunity for human beings to create the emotional and make it an emotional appeal. But after you do that, there, of course, is a role for machines to play. And following the data and learning, revising those hypotheses and iterating, testing blue creative versus the red creative. And of course, blue and red in terms of the different types of creative have evolved into all different types of generative AI, where creatives can do a whole bunch of different things. There's so much opportunity for AI to play a significant role. You may also recall that when we launched a new product in 2018 that we call it Koa and it was our AI solution that helped advertisers to optimize campaigns on our platform. We -- in fact, they use the analogy of copilot which, of course, Microsoft is using today as their analogy to help engineers write code which incidentally, I think, is one of the most interesting ways that people are actually monetizing AI. Almost all the discussion about generative AI is on things that I think are going to have difficulty in actually monetizing. The copilot of Microsoft, I think, is an opportunity to actually monetize and I think it will help our team write code faster. But there is a couple of things that I just want to highlight but I do not believe are happening in a public discussion adequately today. The first is there's this mindset of winner take all and that there's Google versus Microsoft way of looking at things and I just don't think that's the right paradigm. I think we should look at AI like very expensive code. It is expensive to write and it is very expensive to process. It takes more compute power. And because the reason it's more expensive to write is partly because of how complicated it is and the implications, especially of generative AI. So because it's very expensive to both write and to execute, it is an opportunity for bigger companies or at least those that are profitable to do very well. And the fact that we have been operating so profitably for so long puts us in an amazing position. Additionally, there is this topic of the quality of our data sets. And I just want to remind everybody that the Internet has been struggling for a very long time with the concept of truth. Think back to like social networks in the last election cycle and how much discussion was spent on fake news and all these topics that really center around truth. Now that you're able to crawl so much of the Internet to generate essentially artificially intelligence-driven opinions. It is very difficult to figure out what is true. It's even harder than before and I wouldn't say that the Internet did a phenomenal job before. So now of where we're all sitting is we're looking at the datasets that we rely on and say how good are they because the AI will never be better than the quality of our data sets and that is the reason why I think we are in a phenomenal position because so much of the data that we're looking at is, number one, something that we get directly from the data source itself. So we're listening to every ad request on the open Internet. And from that, we have essentially a pure dataset that we can reach conclusions on. We're not scraping user-generated content. We're not scraping the comments section of every website on the Internet, where there's just tons of falsehoods and inaccuracies. We are looking at what people actually read, what they actually listen to, what they actually are interested in and we're able to create conclusions and pair them with UID and have massive datasets that we then can use to make more informed decisions. That creates opportunity for us to play a huge role in the future of AI in advertising. And just to rattle off a few ways that, that can have -- can play a role in our business. We can have an AI assistant for traders and essentially create a better ability to talk to the data. We can automate the building of ad groups and campaigns to find the audiences to make recommendations. We can do a better job of creating not just internal information-seeking, where you write a search query. Although we can, of course, make it easier to query but we can also do a more personal job of summarizing that. And maybe the thing that I'm most excited about is a creative generation, where we can create more variety but also we can make it really easy to create, add especially for video and CTV, for medium and even smaller businesses that I think can lower the barrier to entry for us to move from not just the biggest advertisers in the world but to many, many others, where the friction can be reduced. Those are just a couple of ways that I think AI is going to play a substantial role. I'd just remind everybody that Thomas that I quoted from the CEO of Coca-Cola in the prepared remarks. I think that captures very well and just another opinion that I have on the topic. But hopefully, that gives you a sense of why we're thinking about this so much, why we have been investing really from the very beginning, why we launched Koa in 2018 and why we continue to iterate on it. Thanks so much for the question. Yes. So there is this opportunity for buyers to look across all reach and frequency and all the different places that they buy and summarize that all in one place and that is one of the benefits that the Trade Desk brings to the table, is that people tend to come to us and say, \"I need to have a holistic view.\" And because CTV in particular, is fragmented, as I've said before, perfectly, meaning that it's not too small that there's millions of websites, we have dozens of outlets but it's not too aggregated so that we only have one place to buy which is not that dissimilar from what search is, where you buy from one place or what much of social is. So by having it fragmented, that makes it so needing somebody to look across, everything becomes very important. Now in the cases where you're buying programmatic guarantees or you're buying at a fixed rate and you're not controlling frequency across all these different things, then you lose a lot of the benefits of programmatic. And in fact, you lose decisioning. So what is sometimes happening is people are buying at a fixed rate. They're going to the seller and saying, \"Hey, in the short term, I don't need to control reach and frequency. I don't even care about decisioning. I'll let you, the seller, decide which impressions I get. I just need to move this over from broadcast or traditional television into the digital ecosystem.\" And in that, given that you've sort of weakened the value proposition of programmatic, it is a bit of a jump haul. You could do that with an SSP or a DSP because you've gotten rid of all the benefits or the best benefits of programmatic. So that's where others are stepping up and saying, \"If you want to, you can temporarily use us to buy directly.\" But even if you listen or read closely in, for instance, what Comac [ph] announced in the last couple of days, authorize the same, while people are just moving dollars over, we want to help them move them over. But we do believe that in the medium and long term, this will be very good for DSPs. And what they're acknowledging is that as soon as somebody wants to be holistic about the buy and they want to compare this buy to something else, that they have to use a DSP in order to do that. And so because we're so convinced that the very best of programmatic and really what's in the best interest of buyers is for them to participate in decisioning, not to give that away to the sell side but for them to participate in decisioning. And while sometimes that means they have to pay a little bit more, including to us, that decisioning and what we bring to the table is always worth it. And so it's because of that belief that I believe that the SSPs are highlighting that in the medium and long term, the buyers are going to gravitate to the places where they have decisioning. But in the short term, when people are just trying to move over from essentially an insertion order and not control any amount of decisioning and just do so with sort of dumb pipes, that can be done with us over somebody else. Advantage to do it with somebody else, it is they might be able to save a point or 2. Advantage is doing it with us is they'll have a more holistic view. But we think both medium and long term, they're going to end up going to a place where they can decision holistically. And we think that means they end up with us, especially in the world of CTV. Absolutely. I really appreciate the question and I heard some of those remarks before I jumped over, of course, to focusing on ours and we're very excited by the remarks that Bob made. Let me first just say I'm so proud of our partnership with Disney and what we've done there. I'm also excited about the fact that both Paramount and MBC announced their adoption of UID2 in Q1. So as it relates to all the major content owners in the United States, everyone now has spoken publicly about their adoption of UID2. And I think all of this, whether Bob's comments or the adoption of UID2, is a commentary on the state of streaming competition. So -- and actually, the numbers with Disney are also a commentary on that. They're trying to grow but also be profitable and there's a lot of pressure on the current environment and on cost. So what that means is that people need to do more with less. And especially the content owners, they need higher CPMs so that they can fund all the content and make the same money that they've been making as people continue to make more and more content and the market gets more competitive. The only way to do that is to make the ads more relevant and more effective for the advertisers. The only way to do that is to leverage same-site UID and transparency and biddable marketplaces so that we can participate and get that increased value. What we're most excited about is all of these are moving more towards biddable. So in light of what we just said in the last question when we were talking about how -- when people don't want decisioning, then they can use dumb pipes to execute that. That's not in anyone's best interest long term because advertisers need efficacy, the publishers need higher CPMs. The only way that, that works is in a highly-decision, highly data-driven biddable marketplace. And that means that everybody is moving into a biddable environment. When we look at all the things that we talked about in our Forward '23 event as well as we look at what's happening going into the upfront and honestly, the fact that the upfronts are -- sort of have this cloud over their heads of the writers' strike, I actually think helps us and connected TV because that amount of uncertainty makes it so that people are more likely to say, \"You know what, I'll just buy it in the spot market.\" And the spot market is programmatic. And that's great for everybody, to be honest, because it means a biddable data-driven ecosystem. But what the themes that we keep hearing is that, they want the ability to activate their data. I mean advertisers want the ability to excite their data. We're seeing them buy on value more and more and not on price and that often means that they're willing to pay a premium for decisioning. In fact, in our Forward event in from Hershey's, I think articulated this about as well as anybody can. And in this economic environment, we're seeing more and more people gravitate towards flexibility and having the ability to adjust. And when you add that cloud of the writers' strike, you also add just economic uncertainty. And then you, of course, add in biddable, you have the ability to bring data to the equation, that makes it so that everybody is looking more and more to programmatic as its future. And I think when Bob Iger underlines that, I think it becomes easier for everybody to believe that in the marketplace. So I was excited by his comments. I appreciate your question. You bet. So on the OpEx, I'm going to ask Laura and take the first part of it and then I'll add a little color on that and then I'll also talk about the investment opportunities or feel free to chime in on both. That was amazing. Very impressive, Laura. Thank you. I don't have anything to add on the OpEx. On the investment side, I'll just add, let me first just say I am so excited about the moment that we're in right now in the ecosystem as well as just all the macro conditions that sort of frame this moment for us. And I recognize that there's lots of uncertainty and managing that day to day isn't always fun. But overall, it just creates this amazing opportunity for us and I just want to explain why. So first, we have an opportunity to continue to invest in our people and to grow our culture. So during the pandemic, managing our team and preserving our culture was really hard. Everybody was remote and things like that. It's just -- it was very difficult, in part because of the decisions that Blake and I made to make certain that we didn't invest too aggressively. We were -- we never had to do a layoff. We never had to hit the brakes too hard. And now we're in a moment where we get to continue to hire and he's really set things up well for me and Laura to continue on that path. We are hiring today. And unlike 1.5 years ago, where we were competing with every other company seemingly in the world, especially in Silicon Valley, now we're hiring from those companies and we're not competing with them at all. And so we're able to very carefully choose people because we were one of the first to come back to the office. We were -- we have a culture that's really well intact and we're hiring into that and that allows us to grow. And when you're trying to hire engineers, especially when there's this opportunity to invest like in AI, this environment and this backdrop and our history makes it an amazing time and place to invest in people. As you know, just from knowing our financials at all, like that is our biggest investment, is in our people and it is also our greatest asset no matter what the numbers say. Also I'll just say, of course, we're going to continue to invest in CTV. This is the biggest secular tailwind we may ever see in this company's history. I didn't know that another one would come along when we ran into shopper marketing. Of course, there's an opportunity for us to invest in the forward market which really has a lot to do with CTV. Of course, we're going to keep investing in UID2 and that is going to continue to pay dividends for as far as we can see into the future. And of course, when you have a strong balance sheet like ours, you get to invest in things like AI but you also get to investment in things like a stock repurchase which we started to execute on but there's more opportunity for us to do going forward; so -- just so many places for us to continue to invest. Those are some of the highlights. I'm sure I left off a dozen or more."

            "name": "Blake Grayson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. And good afternoon, everyone. I am immensely proud of our achievements as a company and it has been an honor to work with Jeff and the leadership team as well as so many talented individuals at The Trade Desk. I'm leaving for a new challenge knowing the company is well positioned for the future. Laura is an extremely well-respected and accomplished colleague and has my full confidence as she assumes her new role. Now on to our results; Q1 was an exceptional quarter of financial performance and execution for The Trade Desk. Q1 revenue was $383 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Our Q1 performance was bolstered by the growing trend toward unbiased, data-driven advertising on the open Internet. This shift has played to the strength of our platform as marketers become more agile and deliberate with their digital advertising. While some macro uncertainty in the market has led to relatively uneven ad budgets, we are seeing increasing numbers of marketers embrace our platform to take advantage of our flexible and data-driven approach. Our success in Q1 was demonstrated by several key achievements. Our performance in the CTV space remains robust and we continue to achieve strong momentum in retail media, further solidifying our position as a leading player in the industry. Strong growth returned to many of our key international offices. The growing adoption of UID2 by major advertisers and publishers speaks to the value that is placed on identity in the open Internet ecosystem. In addition, we deepened our partnerships with clients by expanding our joint business plans on a global level, a testament to our unwavering commitment to providing outstanding value and results for our customers. In addition to strong top line performance, in Q1, we generated $109 million in adjusted EBITDA or 28% of revenue, exceeding our own expectations. As it typically occurs, when we outperform on the top line, it generally flows through to our bottom line results as it did in this quarter. This outperformance led to record free cash flow of $177 million in Q1, marking nearly $500 million in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis which is nearly 10x the free cash flow we generated just 3 years ago. In the current environment, our consistent ability to grow our top line revenue while generating meaningfully positive adjusted EBITDA and cash flow puts us in a strong position to continue investing for growth and grabbing land while others are forced to pull back. Additionally, I am proud that our robust cash generation allowed us to return excess capital to shareholders for the first time via our share repurchase program. In Q1, growth was broad-based across channels. The shift of advertising dollars from linear to connected TV continued to be a core driver of our business. From a scaled channel perspective, video which includes CTV represented a mid-40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow rapidly as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend as growth was again solid across in-app and mobile video. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America accounted for 88% of our Q1 spend, with international representing the remaining 12%. We're pleased to report that international growth slightly outpaced North America during this period, with particularly strong performance in EMEA. Our CTV business in Europe grew well into the triple digits year-over-year in Q1. While CTV growth in North Asia also showed encouraging momentum, with year-over-year CTV spend growth in both regions improving each month. Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to capture share in international markets as operating conditions continue to improve. As customers seek to optimize their ad spend, The Trade Desk is well positioned to deliver value and drive ROI as we demonstrated in late 2020. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, travel nearly tripled in spend in Q1 compared with a year ago as the sector continues to recover from the pandemic. Food and drink, automotive and home and garden were also among our strongest performing verticals, while shopping in business were below the average. We continue to believe there is still potential for us to gain share within most of our verticals. Turning now to expenses; excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q1 were $293 million, up 41% year-over-year. We continue to invest prudently in our team during the quarter to support our long-term growth objectives. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, was partly due to in-person events and travel that did not take place in Q1 of the prior year as we had not yet fully resumed back to office work or in-person events. Unlike many ad-funded and technology peers, we have responsibly managed headcount and operating expenses over the past few years, maintaining a focus on profitable growth. As a result, we are well positioned to capture market share and increase spend while generating significant adjusted EBITDA. Our income tax benefit was $19 million in the quarter, mainly due to the tax benefits associated with employee stock-based awards, the timing of which can be variable. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $114 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was a record $188 million and free cash flow was a record $177 million in Q1. DSOs exited in the quarter were 88 days and DPOs were 72 days. We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In February, upon review of our capital allocation strategy, we announced a $700 million share repurchase program. In Q1, we repurchased 5.1 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $293 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities. Before I pass the microphone to Laura to cover the outlook for Q2, I'll summarize by saying The Trade Desk is off to a fantastic start in 2023 with strong momentum across the business. Our robust business model and solid balance sheet have positioned us well to succeed in the current environment with powerful secular trends such as the shift from linear to CTV the growing use of data and marketing campaigns and significant long-term growth drivers such as CTV, retail media, joint business plans and gaining share in international markets, we are highly optimistic about the potential to continue growing and capturing market share in the years ahead. And with that, I'll hand it over to Laura."

            "name": "Laura Schenkein",
            "content": "Thank you, Blake. And thank you, Jeff, for the kind words. I'm incredibly excited to be taking on the CFO role starting next month. I feel fortunate to have worked with Blake these last 3.5 years. It's because of his and Jeff's mentorship that I feel well prepared to take the baton and build upon the strong foundation they've set for CTV's future. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter. While macro conditions remain uncertain, visibility has improved slightly since the beginning of the year. We are cautiously optimistic and estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $452 million which would represent growth of 20% on a year-over-year basis. Excluding U.S. political election spend which represented a low single-digit percent of spend in Q2 2022, our estimated revenue growth rate in Q2 of this year would be about 21% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $160 million in Q2. As Jeff has outlined, with the large addressable market in front of us, we see significant growth opportunities and continue to invest thoughtfully in the business. We continue to be one of the few technology companies capable of consistently generating high top line growth, significant adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow. This enables us to continue distancing ourselves from the competition in areas such as platform renovation, customer service identity and supply chain optimization. In addition, this year, we remain focused on hiring to support future growth, although at about half the rate of 2022 as we expect our year-over-year headcount growth to continue to decelerate as we progress throughout the year. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Absolutely. Thank you, Chloe, for the question. When we look at the big picture for Q2 and the rest of 2023, we're excited. We have a great luxury. We're high growth. We've got profitability and we've got cash flow. I'm proud of how we stay disciplined with our investments over the past few years as it's really paid off. Unlike many of our ad-funded peers and other high-growth tech companies, we've responsibly managed our headcount and operating expense growth since 2019. And since our revenue is still growing well in the double digits while others are contracting or in the low single digits, we intend to and can stay the course and grab share even while our peers are pulling back. So we do expect for 2023 that our operating expenses will increase year-over-year both with and without stock-based compensation and we continue to be extremely deliberate in our investments and our hiring. So our headcount will grow this year but roughly half the rate as it did last year which sets us up nicely for the rest of the year and for 2024. And on the second part of the question, we still see significant opportunities to invest in areas like CTV, data and retail media. So as we've seen in the past, when we outperform on the top line, that usually drops through to the bottom line. We saw that in Q1. And we are comfortable with where things stand and cautiously optimistic about growth this year and say that, especially as we think about significant tailwinds in 2023, that set The Trade Desk apart from other companies and that can help offset anything we see in the macro environment. And by that, I'm talking about a strong GBP pipeline which bodes very well for future growth. CTV as a channel continues to grow incredibly fast. And in the big picture, we still have a relatively small amount of share and lots of room to grow. And then as we've been talking about retail media, we're really just scratching the surface of a $100 billion plus incremental TAM opportunity and all of that makes us extremely excited. Jeff, I don't know if there's anything you would add."

As you've seen from our press release, we again posted very strong growth in the third quarter. Our revenue grew 27% compared with Q3 last year, marking strong revenue growth acceleration on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis. Quarter after quarter, we continue to gain market share, outpacing the industry and our peers, both large and small. Even though it is now a considerable part of our business, CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel and it shows no sign of slowing down. Partners like Disney, NBCU, Walmart, Roku, LG, Netflix and many others are deepening their relationships with us around the growing CTV opportunity. I could not be more excited about our position in CTV and the size of the growth opportunity for us in the years ahead. With our leadership in CTV as well as other areas such as retail media, identity, measurement and data, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing more multiyear joint business plans with leading agencies and brands. In fact, over 40% of our business this year will fall under JBPs, representing spend projections in future years well into the billions of dollars. I have great optimism that The Trade Desk will continue to outperform the market and gain significant share. Exiting this year, we are set up exceptionally well for 2025 and beyond as we continue to execute in areas such as CTV, retail media and in markets outside of the United States. I want to start the core of my remarks by explaining why I believe our industry is changing at an unprecedented rate. I believe there is more opportunity for The Trade Desk than ever before. But in order to understand the significance of our opportunity, we have to contextualize the macro changes and their effects on media, ad tech and the biggest forces in digital advertising. Let's go through 10 significant landscape changes and why these are creating what we see as sustainable secular tailwinds for The Trade Desk. So long as we navigate changing conditions and position ourselves and our clients to benefit from the changes. The first significant landscape vector that is creating a tailwind for The Trade Desk is the macro environment itself that those of you listening or reading this, know all too well. The Fed has been fighting inflation by raising rates. One simple way to frame this relevance to our world is that inflation is measured primarily using price increases implemented by our clients on products we advertise for around the world. The change in fiscal and monetary policies around the world mean the consumer has been forced to reconsider the cost benefit of every product they buy. Advertising plays a bigger role in establishing which brands and which products win market share and which lose market share. The second significant macro vector is related, and that's that CMOs have more pressure than ever to produce real growth and prove it with data. While there has been a lot of macro focus on the reduction in inflation rates, historic highs for stock market indices and growing indications of a soft landing, that's not necessarily translating to consumer confidence, which is why CMOs are becoming much more closely aligned with their CFOs. CFOs want more evidence than ever that marketing is working. And for CFOs that doesn't just mean traditional marketing KPIs. It means growing the top line business. All of our AI and data science injection into Kokai, our latest product release, is encouraging CMOs and CFOs to lean more and more on TTT to deliver real, measured growth. The third macro tailwind that is setting up The Trade Desk for continued outsized gains is the move to AI. Every company needs an AI strategy. Our AI product, Koa, is a great copilot for traders. But this is only the beginning. There are endless possibilities for us as we have one of the best data assets on the Internet. The learnings that come from buying the global open Internet outside of walled gardens. To win in this new frontier, we're looking across our entire suite of products, algorithms and features and asking how they all can be advanced by AI. We have teams focused on incubation, and we've developed team structures to create checks and balances among our distributed development teams. This way, we know the effect of complex AI product and measure the output and inputs of each of them. We expect to talk about these efforts and their results over the coming quarters and years. We are positioned to benefit from our objectivity, our focus, our scale and the loyalty of our buyers. We are already seeing the results of Kokai performance today, but we're just getting started. The fourth sector that is changing the entire landscape of digital advertising and ad tech are the changes happening at Google. Google has an incredibly dominant moneymaking business in search and another in YouTube and also have an incredible opportunity in cloud and AI, most notably in Gemini. Because of the AI race in big tech and these opportunities, Google could continue to downgrade their network business to focus on those prospects. After all, they operate at a disadvantage in the large buyers of the buy side of the open Internet to The Trade Desk because Google lacks subjectivity. If these pressures weren't enough on Google, they also have a pending antitrust trial that has created massive ripples throughout the global ad tech ecosystem. The outcome of the trial itself is less important than the change in behavior that will likely come at Google, no matter what. Whenever the outcome of the trial, I do believe that Google will become more cautious, if not less involved in the part of their business where they compete with us. First off, they are and will remain under tremendous scrutiny in this market, whether it's from U.S. regulators or their many equivalents around the world. By contrast, the convoluted role they play, laid out very clearly by the U.S. Department of Justice, in their network business is likely to play more fairly one way or another. I point this out because it presents tremendous opportunity for our business and for the broader ad tech ecosystem. I have never been more excited about the value of the premium content at scale on the open Internet combined with new approaches to performance efficacy, especially in contrast to the murkiness of cheap reach dynamics within walled gardens such as Google. The fifth macro vector creating incremental secular tailwinds are changes in the market dynamics of CTV. It's hard not to be bullish about CTV when it's both our largest channel and our fastest growing. Advertisers can see more clearly the contrast of our offering and the role we play with brands and agencies, with walled gardens than ever before. This year, we've really started showcasing the strength of sellers and publishers available on our platform and on the open Internet. We've even published a list of 100 of the best destinations on the open Internet. When you contrast the quality of the open Internet with the perils of UGC, it's easy to see that the best of movies, the best of TV, the best of sports, the best of journalism and the best of music and podcasts represents something more valuable to society and to advertisers and short videos and user-generated content surrounded by comment sections that are often not good for brands. At The Trade Desk, we've also been talking a lot about the premium open Internet because that is where consumers are increasingly spending most of their time. Companies like Netflix, Roku, NBC, Spotify, Disney and Fox, along with many others, have redefined the consumers' Internet experience over the last few years. They all recognize the power of advertising to fund the amazing content experiences that their consumers have now come to expect, and they are all investing in the capabilities to capitalize on advertiser demand. This point is worth reiterating because of some of the macro inventory dynamics in digital advertising. You may recall three or four years ago, I would talk on these calls about inventory scarcity, especially in CTV in the fourth quarter, which was enjoying a significant surge because of people spending more time streaming at home during the global pandemic. As advertisers chased those viewer eyeballs to new streaming platforms, advertising inventory was scarce and with demand rising, CPMs went up. But CTV inventory isn't scarce in the same way anymore. Because over the last couple of years, every major media company has launched a streaming service, and all of them have embraced advertising as a key way to fund their content and grow. As inventory scales and scarcity decreases, advertisers have a lot more choice. They also have a harder job, which is assigning value to a lot more inventory. Now it's about the quality of the inventory as well as the quality of the signal. You may remember at our last Investor Day, that we showed a graph of what our clients were willing to pay for CTV ad impressions on the open market. In many cases, we've been significantly higher than the price that the media companies were negotiating in direct deals. The content arms race is more intense and more expensive than ever and media companies need to monetize their content as effectively as possible. Two weeks ago, Variety reported that the top six media companies will increase content spending this year by 9% to a record $126 billion, all of which needs to be funded. Without the benefit of scarcity, media companies now need to provide advertisers with more insight. What am I buying? Who am I reaching? Tools like UID2 and OpenPath, are helping provide that signal. And it's no surprise that platforms like Fox, who are among the first to embrace these tools are benefiting the most. One major news publisher who has deployed OpenPath, so that they can gain a clear understanding of what our clients are willing to pay, saw their fill rate increase by 7x, leading to a revenue increase of more than 25%. The sixth positive secular force helping The Trade Desk is pressure to make the supply chain better. Advertisers and publishers are two endpoints of the supply chain pressure on the edges, meaning the endpoints, means pressure on the whole supply chain. How is, this good for us is perhaps counterintuitive? There are many players in ad tech that are focused on extracting the highest margin possible. In contrast, we have been focused on adding more value than we cost or charge. We do this because it is the right thing to do, but also because it engenders loyalty from our clients and because it is the very essence of economically sustainable. At this moment, the advertising ecosystem is in the process of refining its supply chain to become definitively more efficient than walled gardens with more objective and independent measurement to prove its efficacy. Companies focused on extraction will likely lose share, while companies focus on adding value will likely gain market share. There are many in our industry, who share, the ethos to add value and we're aiming to partner with nearly all of them. However, there are many that don't. Some who take a more short-term approach and are just looking for arbitrage opportunities or places where they can create the quick illusion of value at the expense of agencies, advertisers or sellers and publishers. I do believe, like most markets that that ad tech will go through a long arc will bend toward market efficiency and transparency. It's just a question of how quickly we get there. And in this moment, we have an opportunity to accelerate that progress. There will be more focus than ever on who is adding value and at what cost to advertisers and sellers and publishers. Continuing the potential prioritization changes happening at Google. In a world where Google is more cautious on the open Internet, a brighter light will shine on the value that everyone provides in the ad tech supply chain. I have long said that everyone in our industry should provide more value to the market than they extract. That's a principle we've always followed. Advertisers are under more pressure than ever to do more with less. Sellers and publishers, which is, of course, our term for content owners and the companies who own that content are fighting harder than ever to take home as much of the CPM as possible and simultaneously increase their fill rates. And they want the advertising ecosystem to be as efficient and transparent as possible. That's why most are so eager to partner with us on initiatives like UID2 and OpenPath. So they can provide advertisers with as much signal and transparency as possible. And so advertisers can value their ad impressions as accurately as possible in the context of reaching their target audiences. The seventh macro vector, that I want to talk about today are the trends happening in audio. I want to highlight that many have wrongly defined the advertising TAM of audio to some sort of comparison to legacy radio. Because the biggest players in audio are global and because digital provides potential for far fewer and more relevant ads, I'm convinced if the biggest players move correctly, they can capture one of the biggest opportunities in advertising and media today, which is the delta between time spent in audio channel and the amount of ad budgets heading to that channel. Digital audio is at the early stages of its evolution. The channel is in a similar position to where CTV was a few years ago. Consumers in the U.S. spend an average of three hours per day consuming digital audio, up significantly over the last five years, and advertisers are eager to capitalize on this emerging advertising channel. At the moment, advertisers are looking for clear trusted signals to inform what they buy. Trust but verify, has become a mantra around the open Internet. Just a few weeks ago, media reported on our major expanded partnership with Spotify. They will be deploying both UID2 and OpenPath, so that advertisers can find as much addressability and insight as possible for Spotify's high-value ad impressions. I don't think there's a company in the media universe that's been more successful than Spotify at building a subscription model. In the audio world, Spotify gives us access to almost all of the world's music for a low monthly subscription. In many ways, Spotify has been at the forefront of this mass consumer shift to digital audio. I think they are in the process of becoming well positioned to get incremental users due to a good ad experience and to get incremental ad budgets for the exact same reason. You only have to listen to their most recent earnings report to understand how seriously they are taking the ad-supported side of their business and building out their programmatic capabilities over the next several years. We are very excited to partner with them in this work and to help our advertiser clients make the most of this fast-growing channel, where listeners are highly engaged and leaned in. Our partnership with Spotify is one of the inventory partnerships that I'm most optimistic about. The eighth macro vector aiding in our outsized growth is the massive opportunity around retail media. To summarize this at a high level, Amazon has showcased to retailers around the world the benefit of using retail purchase data to make retail businesses work better. If advertisers advertise products people like and want and frequently buy at their stores like Walmart or Target or Albertsons or Dollar General or many, many others, those retailers, of course, will sell more product, so do the company is making and selling the products. The significance of this vector and the role it's played in our success the past few years, deserves a much larger space of time, which I expect to do in the coming quarters. The ninth macro tailwind is the changes happening in live sports. Of course, sports is some of the most premium and most expensive content and media. Because it is often scarce and often highly sought out by brands, and it changes very quickly, it really is built for programmatic advertising. The best moments in sports are surprises and unpredictable. That's what makes them so exciting. However, it's also what makes them hard to plan around and to price properly. I expect over the coming years to see programmatic spot markets and sports become best friends. We are enjoying our strongest year-to-date with live sports as the football season has kicked off here in the United States, we are looking at, on average, 1.5 billion ad impressions per weekend. We have dozens of major brands buying football through our platform for the first time and many others increasing spend in the triple-digit range. One example is a major quick-serve restaurant chain here in the United States. This client had been advertising on traditional linear television, but with its customer base, mostly aged over 45 and restaurant visits among that demographic decreasing, they wanted to expand their customer base to reach younger adults and young families using CTV. Working with their agency, Happy Cog and their partner, Clever, this restaurant chain worked with us to target their audience with a specific focus on live football opportunities on CTV, followed up with online video and display, all in an omnichannel approach. Our platform enables the restaurant to target their audiences with precision and use new measurement tools to understand the impact of those ads on brand intent. As a result, this client saw a 15% increase in brand awareness among their target audience and a 9% increase in mobile transactions where CTV was the first ad served. This is a great example of how programmatic on our platform is driving high-value business results. The tenth macro trend helping us grow is this net effect of all of these changes at once. I've said publicly a few times that the biggest thing Google has going for it in its defense against the Department of Justice is complexity. It's hard to make sense of this industry and all of the forces changing it so rapidly. Our clients need help. They are navigating unprecedented change and unprecedented pressure. Fortunately, our buy-side focus and our objectivity aligns our interest with clients and positions us to stand with agencies and brands shoulder to shoulder as we face supply chain changes that ultimately benefit the open Internet and the market, but will require adjustments across the ecosystem. We're here to help and have proven ourselves to be one of the leaders of the open Internet. All of these 10 macro forces when joined with our amazing team, our global footprint, our buy-side focus and our amazing product, including the recent platform overhaul found in Kokai, are showing the early signs of the future promise of our innovations, our objectivity, our AI and our company. Clients are seeing performance upgrades around the world, many of whom are embracing new approaches to objective data-driven measurement The Trade Desk offers. So as we exit 2024 and look forward to 2025, The Trade Desk is better positioned than we have ever been. 2024 has been a banner year for CTV, and we have further cemented our position as the first choice platform to help leading brands as they continue to shift their budgets from linear TV and UGC into CTV. Retail Media has rapidly become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business, a trend we expect to accelerate through 2025. Retail data on our platform is transforming how many CPG advertisers approach measurement and attribution. Innovations in Kokai are helping advertisers identify and target new potential customers with much greater precision. Data elements per impression continued to increase, resulting in significantly better performance helping unlock budgets and win new business. Our premium content partnerships activated through supply path innovations such as OpenPath and the Sellers and Publishers 500+ marketplace, are helping advertisers value and select ad impressions with more objectivity than ever. Innovations like UID2, which has reached critical mass, are helping advertisers pioneer better approaches to addressability in a changing identity environment. And our investments in new measurement capabilities from the TV Quality Index to our growing network of retail data partners are helping advertisers prove the efficacy of their campaigns in new objective ways. Let me conclude by underlining that taken together, these initiatives along with many others, position The Trade Desk very well for market-leading growth in the years ahead. I believe it is worth noting again, we continue to significantly gain market share. I believe our level of relative outperformance, 27% revenue growth in the third quarter is indicative of the value we are delivering to our clients as they deal with an uncertain consumer environment. We continue to sign JBPs with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace with billions of dollars transacted through these partnerships each year now. I believe we will look back on 2024 as an inflection point in terms of how advertisers value the premium open Internet, driven by CTV and digital audio as a compelling alternative to walled gardens. And I expect advertisers will emerge in 2025, more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a result, we will continue to gain share. And with that, I'll hand it over to Laura to cover our financials.\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. As our third quarter results demonstrate, The Trade Desk is executing at a high level, outpacing peers and capturing increased market share. We achieved robust accelerating year-over-year revenue growth while delivering outstanding profitability and cash flow. Key investment initiatives, including performance advancements in our Kokai platform, expansion in CTV, retail media and supply chain innovations like our OpenPath technology, are not only strengthening our foundation, but position us for durable growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to our results. Revenue in Q3 was $628 million, representing growth of 27% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter and year-over-year. We continue to win more share of our clients' advertising budgets as they increasingly prioritize platforms like The Trade Desk that deliver high-value results, especially in premium video and CTV. This trend is a familiar dynamic in our industry that we witnessed many times over the years. When CMOs faced pressure to achieve more with less, they turn to platforms like ours for flexibility, precision and measurable results. During the third quarter, CTV led our growth from a scale channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we continue to win incremental shopper marketing budgets. International spend growth outpaced North America once again with notably strong performance in CTV. With the strong top line performance in Q3, we generated approximately $257 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 41% of revenue and free cash flow $222 million. From a scale channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin, led our growth again during the third quarter. In Q3, video, which includes CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30 percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represents around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q3 and international represented about 12%. We are pleased that our ad spend outside North America grew at a faster rate year-over-year than inside North America, as has been the case for the last seven quarters in a row. CTV continued to drive our growth across both EMEA and Asia Pacific. We see significant opportunities to capture more share in these regions in the quarters and years ahead. In terms of verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, growth was broad-based again this quarter. We saw strong performance in the majority of our verticals, particularly in medical health, which includes advertising related to health care and pharmaceuticals as well as home and garden and pets. Political spending was also strong in Q3 as expected. Family relationships healthy living verticals were both below average. Overall, we saw healthy trends across categories, and we continue to believe there is opportunity for us to gain share in all of the verticals we serve. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q3 were $391 million, up 24% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in our teams, our platform and our infrastructure support sustained growth. Income tax expense was $33 million for the third quarter driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $207 million or $0.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $273 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $222 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 89 days, down two days from a year ago. DTOs were 74 days, down one day from a year ago. In Q3, via our share repurchase program, we repurchased $54 million of Class A common stock. We will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities. We exited the third quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.7 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV, retail media and political. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $756 million, which would represent growth of about 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $363 million in Q4. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter, and we are cautiously optimistic for Q4. We continue to gain momentum across our biggest priorities, delivering profitable growth and significant share gains. As we look ahead to the remainder of Q4 and 2025, we believe we have never been in a better position than we are today. With large growth drivers, including the ongoing secular shift to CTV, upgrading measurement with retail data expansion outside North America, a strong identity framework, strengthening of the supply chain and the ability to drive leverage in our model, we remain optimistic for many years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Shyam Patil from Susquehanna. Shyam, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nShyam Patil: Hi, guys. Great job on the strong growth and the results. I just had one bigger-picture question. Jeff, can you talk a little bit more about kind of what you're seeing in terms of the near-term macro for 3Q and 4Q? And then for next year, how you view the macro and set up for Trade Desk? Thank you\nJeffGreen: You bet. Thanks, Shyam, for the question. And for the kind words. So first, I just want to point out that the most significant macro vectors that I can talk about are the things that we itemized in the prepared remarks. So we've taken more time this time to talk about the macro vectors that are affecting us, especially into next year in the prepared remarks this time. So I just encourage everybody to spend a little bit more time with them because we spent a little bit more time preparing them. As it relates to the here and now, though, I'm incredibly proud of our performance in the third quarter, and we are currently firing on all cylinders, whether that's what's happening in CTV, it being both our largest channel and our fastest growing, which -- those two things don't usually go hand in hand or the amazing efforts in Kokai. It started the year as an engineering effort and has since turned into both an engineering effort as well as our sales and client services teams getting that adopted. The adoption has been phenomenal. The product is the best that we've ever shipped. So a lot going for us in that. UID2 has become the primary currency of identity in the open Internet. And then, of course, we have so much going for us in retail media and supply path optimization. I really do believe we're in a stronger position than we have ever been. As it relates to the macro market sort of in the here and now, I do want to just highlight that CMOs are dealing with a lot of uncertainty and a lot of scrutiny. And the uncertainty they've seen a lot of over the last few years, but the scrutiny, I don't know that it's been more than they have right now. And as a result, brands are under pressure to grow, and that is good for us. So even though it's a little bit tense for the market, it's good for us because they're turning to us saying, how can we help? And I do want to also highlight that there is a difference between the stock market being at an all-time high and consumers feeling as confident as they've ever been. And that is not where many consumers are especially sort of on the left side of the bell curve. So if you make less than the median household income, then you're more affected by price. And if you're selling products to those people, then it is probably affecting your business more than others. And so as a result, some brands are in a phenomenal position and some are in a more difficult position in this current market as they face inflation and consumer weakness, changes in interest rates and all the implications as to how products need to be marketed. As a result, they need to be more agile, more focused on efficacy, more focus on efficiencies than ever before. And so what we do, which is give them more data and honestly give them control of their own future. It means that they are leaning in more than they ever have before. They're looking for solutions to help them. But when you couple that with why programmatic advertising is the leading source of growth in advertising, which is that, of course, we've been outperforming the market. Of course, it's a place where you can put data to work on a case-by-case basis and optimize for personalization. Of course, when you're using data-driven advertising and marketing, that is the very best place to inject AI in distributed models in the way that we have. And then, of course, when we take our joint business plans and all the other efforts that we have, we're in a really phenomenal position. One other thing I just want to highlight is that political in both Q3 and Q4 was as expected. It's been very strong. And -- but we are mindful that some brands are not as interested as advertising in a polarized political environment. And so those dynamics have made things a little bit different in this Q4 than in other Q4s. One other thing that also gives me a tremendous amount of optimism for the future is that some of our most significant partnerships, whether that's Netflix or Disney or Roku or Fox or Spotify are all in what I would call the crawl phase of our partnership. We've done some amazing themes with some of those. Others, we've always talked about doing amazing things and we've done just sort of testing the pipes. But I think the very best is yet to come in all of those partnerships. And so in the short term, they're making small contributions, but I think the very best is yet to come and all of that, and I'm sure we'll talk about OpenPath and some other things later. But that gives you a sense of what we're facing in the short term.\nShyam Patil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vasily Karasyov from Cannonball Research. Vasily, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nVasily Karasyov: Hi Jeff, I have a question about Google. As they remain under pressure from regulators, what are you seeing in the market in terms of how -- is it easier? Is it harder for you to get -- to win spend from brands? And then with Google Network business continuing its negative or \u2013 negative growth, does The Trade Desk really have any preference on what happens in this DOJ trial? Thank you.\nJeffGreen: You bet. Thank you. I appreciate the question. So first, a little bit of context. As you know, the Department of Justice already concluded one of its trials against Google on that of search. And the Department of Justice won. And I would argue that the case the Department of Justice has against Google on the ad tech side is even more compelling. It is more compelling, but it's also more complicated, which makes it a little bit harder to predict, but I think the case is incredibly compelling for the government. But regardless of what happens, I believe we will win. And I do want to underline the things that I said in the prepared remarks, Google is a phenomenal company. I think they have a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead of it as it relates to search and cloud and AI and Gemini. But it is clear that they have been deprioritizing network, and it has not performed the way that the rest of their business has. If I were in Sundar shoes, I would deprioritize it too, because of the opportunities that they have on those other fronts as well as just the nature of their business, which is pretty dependent on them making very high margins on media that has a cost of goods sold that is incredibly low. And the premium content of the Internet does not have a low cost of goods sold and therefore, makes it hard to move the needle on a P&L as big as Google's. So I anticipate that they will deprioritize it. But even if they don't, what I think is inevitable is that Google has to play more fair. What has clearly come out in the trial is that they have not always played fair, and that might be the understatement of call. But we have managed to win in an unfair market. I believe they will be forced, whether that's from government or just by their own choosing because this risk-reward is not worth it. So by their own choosing, I think they would make the market more fair and therefore, make it easier for us to do well. So that's why I maintain that regardless of what happens in the trial itself, I believe that we'll do well and that we'll continue to win. I think there are scenarios where the landscape looks very different depending on what happens to Google and regulation, especially on the supply side, which is at the core of the government's case, which underlines the fact that I don't think anybody is disputing as it relates to the trial itself, but The Trade Desk will continue to do well. So I think we're in a great position. I'm very excited to see the outcome, and I think we win no matter what. Thanks for the question.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Jessica, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Hi, Jeff, we've seen The Trade Desk deploy many initiatives over the years focusing on the supply chain from the gold standard for SSPs to UID2 to S&P 500+ and now OpenPath. Can you wrap this all together and speak about how the work you've done on the supply chain with OpenPath, and what this initiative means -- can mean to the value of The Trade Desk with its partners over the next several years? And I guess like secondarily, when do you scale? Because as you said, during the crawl phase with many of the users of OpenPath, I mean just starting like Disney and Fox, et cetera, and some that you've mentioned like Netflix, not even on the platform yet.\nJeff Green: Thank you so much. Appreciate the question. A lot to unpack there. So let me first just give a little bit of history so that you and I bring everyone along in this question. So I love that you know about it because we weren't very public about the gold standard back in 2017, but we certainly talked to SSPs and at exchanges about it. I would essentially summarize that effort as us saying to the sell side, here's the sort of signal that we would like to see, and we are just going to tell you in advance. When we see this signal, we're more likely to bid up because these are the things that give us indication of value. We haven't always done that in the past. But we did start doing that in 2017. As you know, UID2 was an effort to make identity ubiquitous across the Internet. When we first announced it, a number of companies suggested that we would never be successful because they thought we'd have to get 2 billion consumers to sign up for us to have any sort of footprint. And we explained then that our play was not to go sign up 2 billion consumers or to go direct but instead to partner with the infrastructure of the Internet, and we've done that across the board. Then as you point out, in the last two years, we've launched two initiatives. One is the Sellers and Publishers 500+ as well as the OpenPath. Sellers and Publishers 500+ is meant to make it easier for people who are currently buying private marketplaces, which often have really slowed or small trickles of inventory and they don't necessarily realize how much they've limited their decisioning power by only considering a small amount of inventory. So by selecting some of the most prominent and safe parts of the open Internet to buy across all of it. They expand their ability to find value. Because many times, the reason people enter into private marketplaces is simply to be safe. And so we've given them a very safe large ecosystem for them to buy into. And it's something that we'll just continue to promote and make accessible and provide transparency into what, of course, they're buying. But OpenPath, it might be aside from UID2, the most significant venture of all of them. And all OpenPath is, is our willingness to go one step further from gold standard and share with the sell side exactly what we're willing to pay on any given impression opportunity. And the reason why we do that is because there are many publishers who are saying, I don't have any idea what you're willing to pay because of all of the companies that exist between us and it's a way for them to hold them accountable to earn their keep. Some have wrongly assumed that this is us trying to cut them out. It is not. It is us trying to empower the publishers to make certain that they earn their keep. And the reason for that is that we are competing with walled gardens. We're competing with the most successful companies in the history of advertising, companies like Facebook and companies like Google. Those walled gardens have one advantage, which is that they control the supply chain end to end. And therefore, they're not at the risk of players in the middle of the supply chain, extracting too much and then decreasing the value proposition of those that participate in the entire open Internet rather than just in a particular walled garden. And too often, an advertiser pays $1 and less than $0.50 ends up in the pocket of the publisher. So OpenPath is a bit of -- to mix metaphors or to at least use two of them, it's a bit of a light on hill as well as a canary in the coal mine. Buyers get better visibility in the overall supply chain and the reason why I say light on the hill is because we don't necessarily need OpenPath to be on every impression. In fact, we have no expectation that it will. But we will have it run often enough, especially with the largest players on open Internet to know how to grade all the other supply chains, all the other ways that we could potentially buy so that we hold it accountable to be as efficient as possible. The way I view this is it is a race between walled gardens and the open Internet to create the most efficient supply chain. Walled gardens have the advantage on one level, which is that they control at all. But they operate at a disadvantage because they only operate with UGC and they only operate with content that has a very low cost of goods sold and don't have the appeal of all the best parts of the open Internet, which I think we described well in the prepared remarks. The advantage that we have is not only do we have the premium side of the open Internet. But we also have the forces of capitalism of competition, of all things that make markets great that we can partner with so many different companies and through a collection of efforts outperform on any single one company. I don't think you can count on any one company to be a source of all innovation. And we've got a business model that I don't think goes out of style, the way that many destinations do. And so in order for us to be a company that services the entire open Internet. I believe it's essential for us to have a product like OpenPath. So it's a really critical part of our present and future and really appreciate the question, Jessica. So we had a platform to talk about it more.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Shweta Khajuria from Wolfe Research. Shweta your line is live. Please go ahead.\nShweta Khajuria: Thank you for taking my question. Jeff, I have one on CTV growth. So it's your largest and fastest, you have a lot of catalysts that enable healthy sustainable growth in CTV. So when we think about the drivers over the, call it, next two to three years, how would you rank order the impact of secular tailwinds to third-party partnerships that you may expand to your forward product, international expansion, rising levels of ad tech or AI that will be used in measuring or anything else? Like can you please help us on back key drivers that will allow you to sustain growth at a healthy clip in the near to midterm? And then the follow-up is how do you see Amazon evolve as a DSP over the same timeframe?\nJeffGreen: Thanks for the question. You did a pretty good job of laying out all the other key secular drivers for us, the tailwinds that are helping. The first and foremost, over the last few years has been at times anxiety about will there be walled gardens in CTV, , not because we ever thought that was a viable path because I believe that is not a viable path because it's too fragmented. But instead, what all of the major players have come to understand is that when you have a premium product, the very best way to get the most out of it is to auction that off. And of course, to describe it in great detail. When you're not selling an average product, you have to describe it better in order to get the premium that you deserve. And that's true, whether you're selling cars or art or ads. And I would also add that conflict of interest is an even more inferior playbook in CTV than it is in any other channel or any other corner of media. So as a result, I would argue that Amazon operates at a much bigger disadvantage in CTV than in any other channel. So we've argued against Google's lack of objectivity in every other part of the open Internet and they've been less of a competitor in CTV. Amazon has been more of a competitor in CTV, but I think Google was a more formidable competitor in the other parts of the open Internet than Amazon is in CTV and that is simply because of that conflict of interest. They are going to be pushing ads on premium content that they own, meanwhile, neglecting premium content that others own, while we have no dog in the hunt, and we're just trying to help people objectively decide, do I buy the ad on Netflix or do I buy the ad on Hulu or Tubi or somewhere else. So as a result, you take all the partnerships that we put together, and I think those are a significant driver for our growth in the future. A couple of years ago, I would have said that we were leading the CTV market in Australia and in the United States. That's expanded to other markets like the U.K. and to Germany but there are still way more opportunities around the world. As I mentioned last quarter, I was in India over the summer and just the opportunities there in every channel, but especially in CTV and audio are just spectacular. And so the opportunities that exist for us around the world couldn't be better. We've also established UID2, it's not only the currency of the open Internet, but it is especially the currency of connected television. In a way, that's the way it became the currency of open Internet is because of CTV. So what I think is the most significant thing to watch over the next couple of years, is that so many content owners have put ads on their content now that what was once a shortage is no longer the discussion. It's no longer a discussion about scarcity or about shortages of inventory. And so as a result, they are trying to distinguish themselves from each other. This is what has been the case in streaming wars, but now that's also true of the ad experience in the streaming wars. And so they will be describing their inventory better than they have historically. We will have more choice than we have historically. I think that the premium content will do better. I think the content that has identity attached to it will also do better. I think that position CTV to do really well, but there will be a lot of work done over the next couple of years for them to layer identity as well as other metadata to give buyers the very best chance to value it properly and to pay the premium that they need in order to continue to fund their massively expensive content machines. So hopefully, that helps. I really appreciate the question.\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks Jeff. That is helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Laura Martin from Needham. Laura, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nLaura Martin: Okay. Great. So Jeff, I'm just going to ask you one and it's the hardest question I guess. And that is that Trade Desk is growing two to three times faster than other SSPs and DSPs, even those that are public. Is there a tipping point would you eat too much of your competitors, you take too much share. And there isn't an open Internet for you to compete with or trade with and therefore, your growth gets limited by the fact that you must have trading partners on the other side and on the same side of the open Internet? Thank you.\nJeffGreen: Laura thanks for the question. I like this one a lot. I didn't see this one coming. So big picture, I believe that the advertising ecosystem around the world is about a $1 trillion industry today, especially when you include retail media. I think it's about that today. Lots of different numbers out there that aren't that too far away from that, but it just depends on whether you include retail in that or not. If you look at what we're doing, $13 billion, $14 billion a year at this point, we're just over 1% of that $1 trillion. I look at it as we have 99% of the pie left and there's so much opportunity for us to do more. As I'm looking at that pie and say, how do we not get distracted by all the different ways that we could go and all the different things that we could build and parts of the pie we could pursue, how do we stay focused, I look at the biggest piece of the pie and say, okay, there's the U.S., there's CTV and of course, up and coming channels like audio, but those represent, I think, the most premium opportunities for us to go pursue. I would point back to the comments in the prepared remarks about, we think that every company in ad tech needs to add more value than they charge or extract. Some of the companies in ecosystem don't think that way. They think about charging rents or extraction. And there's often a mindset that is ride the wave while it lasts instead of how do I build something that really lasts, that I'm adding more value over time, creating more consumer surplus where your consumer or your client gets more value over time and therefore, making it more, more and sustainable and making your customers more and more loyal. I think there's a lot of pressure on the companies in the middle, including some of those that you referenced, and that they have to be focused on adding more value than they extract. I think if we do the right thing for advertisers and then give visibility to publishers that will create a more effective supply chain and that is the biggest impeder or roadblock for our growth is an inefficient supply chain. So we need to make certain the supply chain is as efficient as possible. And that means partnering with all of those companies that are adding more value than they extract and continuing to obsess about the supply chain, but I don't have any worry that we can cannibalize the market. We're 1% of it. So I think there's just so much opportunity for us ahead.\nLaura Martin: Thank you. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Justin Patterson from KeyBanc. Justin, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJustin Patterson: All right. Thank you. Jeff, I wanted to touch on the audio opportunities some more. Obviously, we also had Spotify ad exchange announcement. When you kind of step back and you compare where we were at with audio versus CTV, what are some of the key things that need to change in the industry for this to become a much larger percentage of the business? I think audio is still roughly 5% of your spend today? Thank you.\nJeffGreen: Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. I think audio is in a slightly different position than CTV, in the sense that when it was a more legacy business, meaning before the Internet changed everything. The distribution models were more around local and the way radio sold ads was just different than the way TV sold ads. And there is less a sense of national. And of course, in CTV now, there's more of a sense of even global. And of course, in audio, there's a very global sense inside of businesses like Pandora and Spotify. So because things are being redefined, I think people have wrongly defined the TAM as being something quite small where when you look at time spent and you look at the amount of engagement with audio content, it is really off the charts and represents a tremendous amount of consumers' time. So that's why I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if companies like Pandora and Spotify and so many others execute well. I think there's just tremendous upside for them. And of course, I watch carefully when I see in their earnings that 10% to 13% of the revenue comes from ads but most of their most of their subscribers or most of their users are asking for ads. And so I think that represents a tremendous opportunity for them. I'm a big believer in Daniel and Alex, and I believe they're on the on the path to get there. But there's a lot of work ahead. There's a lot of development that has to happen. This is going to be a multiyear process but I'm extremely optimistic about what that means for the future and think that it can represent a greater percentage of our business than it does today. And I think that audio can be a bigger percentage of the overall pie than it's arguably ever been before. I don't know that, that will necessarily take or cut into CTV and premium video at all. But I do believe from some of the other channels, it will and should. So I'm pretty optimistic about the future of spot of Spotify and audio, but we all have a lot of work to do.\nJustin Patterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Dan Salmon from New Street Research. Dan, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nDan Salmon: Okay, good. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Laura, you highlighted that political was strong as expected. Any more you can do to quantify its expected impact for 2024 revenues implied by your guidance? I think it was a mid-single-digit impact in the last presidential cycle. And Jeff, you called out how some advertisers will step out of the market or get crowded out by higher pricing in some ad markets. Do you think those dollars that left can offset political -- partially offset it? Just trying to think about the impact of that on our 2025 model. And maybe just one quick follow-up to slip in. If you could just give us your updated views on CapEx for the remainder of the year and how you're thinking about it into 2025? Thank you.\nLaura Schenkein: Thanks for the questions and absolutely happy to answer. We went into the last political cycle, the last big one back in 2020 saying that political spend was in the mid-single digits, and we believe for this year of 2024, it will be in the low single digits as a percent of our overall spend. When we think about how we consider political in Q4 and then go into thinking about how we're modeling going into 2025, it's a really nuanced, but important question this year. Typically, what we see is that Q1 is, on average, a 22%, 23% sequential decline from Q4. And in political years, it's critical to exclude that political contribution in Q4 which we believe, again, will be a low to mid-single-digit percent for that quarter as we go into modeling Q1 of 2025. On the second part of your question, which includes capital expenditures for 2024 and 2025. We've said been consistent that we expect CapEx to increase in 2024 and 2025. But in both cases, it should be around 5% of revenue and that hasn't changed. We invest primarily in two areas. The first thing, our infrastructure, which includes data centers and the second being our offices around the world as we have employees who are coming into work every week. So again, I just want to reiterate there that we don't expect any significant changes in CapEx this year or next year relative to the last few years.\nJeffGreen: And Dan, as it relates to the part of the question, that was directed to me, the 2024 that was taken out, meaning those advertisers that spend a little bit less in 2024 or Q4 because they don't want to be to be next political, will that back in 2025? Of course. In fact, in many cases, in Q4, it didn't go anywhere. It just got postponed or moved to other channels. So it doesn't necessarily go anywhere just reallocates its form. But in 2025, we think the cycle is a bit more typical and rates are more predictable, then it's also a little bit easier to predict the shape of the curve throughout the quarter simply because you don't have a big change on November 5.\nDan Salmon: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Jason, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks for taking the question. So Jeff, you highlighted or I guess, in the press release, Yahoo -- the Roku integration in the quarter. And I guess I want to ask, how does this play into your broader CTV strategy around UID and buying unduplicated reach and frequency. And it's fair to assume you'll have similar integrations with top, whatever it is, three or four CTV platforms? Thank you.\nJeffGreen: You bet. Thanks so much for the question. I'm so proud of what we've done with Roku this year. We've had a long-standing relationship with them, but it's really borne fruit in this year. And it really represents a significant change for them as it relates to adopting things like UID2 and some of the principles of the open Internet. But of course, the Roku channel has grown tremendously for them, and they have become not only a partner for us as a distributor of others' content, but also a premium publisher themselves. I'm so excited by what they've done with UID2 and because of some of the assets they have with ACR and whatnot, I expect our partnership to continue to grow in the coming years. So I'm very optimistic about our partnership with Roku. I expect that to continue to expand and very much appreciate the question.\nJason Helfstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today will come from Matthew Swanson from RBC Capital Markets. Matthew, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Swanson: Yes. Thank you so much for taking my question. If I can maybe marry up a couple of the vectors you talked about, Jeff, specifically the idea that CMOs are under more pressure. And then also some of the capabilities and the traction you're seeing from Kokai. I guess, what type of work does it take to help CMOs and the users understand the metrics coming out of Kokai but also to kind of gain trust around them? I know that's been a challenge in some other walled garden platforms, so people trusting the attribution data.\nJeffGreen: Yes. So it's -- I really appreciate the question because I think this is one of the more nuanced ways that we have just so much opportunity in front of us. And honestly, we were contemplating adding other macro vectors that are helping us and one of them is the state of measurement, which would have been number 11. But the state of measurement is that walled gardens have essentially been grading their own homework for many, many years. And one of the things that they've done really well is convinced people to use their own metrics and kept things quite simple. But at times, that's been really difficult for some of the biggest brands in the world because they'll be told by a walled garden, we help you sell 101 toothbrushes, when the company actually only sold 100 toothbrushes total. So when you have that phenomenon, you start to doubt the credibility of those metrics. We have a very different dilemma or challenge, which is that we've been sharing so much data with them and given them so many options about the way to attribute success and attribute sales we've overwhelmed them with complexity and with numbers and there are so many different ways for us to answer those questions. But because we're committed to doing that with integrity and with objectivity, we'd rather have a conversation with them about how do you want to measure success. There's a whole bunch of different ways to do it. Let us help you put together the one that makes sense for you. So as CMOs and CFOs get closer together and their offices, in some cases, moved closer together. As they get closer together, there -- a lot of our discussions, in fact, some of our biggest wins in last quarter and this one have come from us understanding what the CFO is looking for from the CMO so that we can go back and put together the metrics that prove we're creating incremental sales or growth. So it's largely about figuring out what they are looking for and us getting better at not making everything bespoke and reinventing the wheel. But at the same time, not oversimplifying it, assuming that we have all the answers and just create our own homework with a single metric. So I'm very optimistic about what that means for the future because I do think there is a very important principle that we have been saying since the day we went public, which is objectivity matters a lot today, but it will matter more tomorrow and it will matter more the day after that. And as time marches on, we think that, that continues to be one of our greatest strategic advantages over the biggest names in tech.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's Q&A session and conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release, we again posted very strong growth in the third quarter. Our revenue grew 27% compared with Q3 last year, marking strong revenue growth acceleration on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis. Quarter after quarter, we continue to gain market share, outpacing the industry and our peers, both large and small. Even though it is now a considerable part of our business, CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel and it shows no sign of slowing down. Partners like Disney, NBCU, Walmart, Roku, LG, Netflix and many others are deepening their relationships with us around the growing CTV opportunity. I could not be more excited about our position in CTV and the size of the growth opportunity for us in the years ahead. With our leadership in CTV as well as other areas such as retail media, identity, measurement and data, we are winning more business with both new and existing customers. We are signing more multiyear joint business plans with leading agencies and brands. In fact, over 40% of our business this year will fall under JBPs, representing spend projections in future years well into the billions of dollars. I have great optimism that The Trade Desk will continue to outperform the market and gain significant share. Exiting this year, we are set up exceptionally well for 2025 and beyond as we continue to execute in areas such as CTV, retail media and in markets outside of the United States. I want to start the core of my remarks by explaining why I believe our industry is changing at an unprecedented rate. I believe there is more opportunity for The Trade Desk than ever before. But in order to understand the significance of our opportunity, we have to contextualize the macro changes and their effects on media, ad tech and the biggest forces in digital advertising. Let's go through 10 significant landscape changes and why these are creating what we see as sustainable secular tailwinds for The Trade Desk. So long as we navigate changing conditions and position ourselves and our clients to benefit from the changes. The first significant landscape vector that is creating a tailwind for The Trade Desk is the macro environment itself that those of you listening or reading this, know all too well. The Fed has been fighting inflation by raising rates. One simple way to frame this relevance to our world is that inflation is measured primarily using price increases implemented by our clients on products we advertise for around the world. The change in fiscal and monetary policies around the world mean the consumer has been forced to reconsider the cost benefit of every product they buy. Advertising plays a bigger role in establishing which brands and which products win market share and which lose market share. The second significant macro vector is related, and that's that CMOs have more pressure than ever to produce real growth and prove it with data. While there has been a lot of macro focus on the reduction in inflation rates, historic highs for stock market indices and growing indications of a soft landing, that's not necessarily translating to consumer confidence, which is why CMOs are becoming much more closely aligned with their CFOs. CFOs want more evidence than ever that marketing is working. And for CFOs that doesn't just mean traditional marketing KPIs. It means growing the top line business. All of our AI and data science injection into Kokai, our latest product release, is encouraging CMOs and CFOs to lean more and more on TTT to deliver real, measured growth. The third macro tailwind that is setting up The Trade Desk for continued outsized gains is the move to AI. Every company needs an AI strategy. Our AI product, Koa, is a great copilot for traders. But this is only the beginning. There are endless possibilities for us as we have one of the best data assets on the Internet. The learnings that come from buying the global open Internet outside of walled gardens. To win in this new frontier, we're looking across our entire suite of products, algorithms and features and asking how they all can be advanced by AI. We have teams focused on incubation, and we've developed team structures to create checks and balances among our distributed development teams. This way, we know the effect of complex AI product and measure the output and inputs of each of them. We expect to talk about these efforts and their results over the coming quarters and years. We are positioned to benefit from our objectivity, our focus, our scale and the loyalty of our buyers. We are already seeing the results of Kokai performance today, but we're just getting started. The fourth sector that is changing the entire landscape of digital advertising and ad tech are the changes happening at Google. Google has an incredibly dominant moneymaking business in search and another in YouTube and also have an incredible opportunity in cloud and AI, most notably in Gemini. Because of the AI race in big tech and these opportunities, Google could continue to downgrade their network business to focus on those prospects. After all, they operate at a disadvantage in the large buyers of the buy side of the open Internet to The Trade Desk because Google lacks subjectivity. If these pressures weren't enough on Google, they also have a pending antitrust trial that has created massive ripples throughout the global ad tech ecosystem. The outcome of the trial itself is less important than the change in behavior that will likely come at Google, no matter what. Whenever the outcome of the trial, I do believe that Google will become more cautious, if not less involved in the part of their business where they compete with us. First off, they are and will remain under tremendous scrutiny in this market, whether it's from U.S. regulators or their many equivalents around the world. By contrast, the convoluted role they play, laid out very clearly by the U.S. Department of Justice, in their network business is likely to play more fairly one way or another. I point this out because it presents tremendous opportunity for our business and for the broader ad tech ecosystem. I have never been more excited about the value of the premium content at scale on the open Internet combined with new approaches to performance efficacy, especially in contrast to the murkiness of cheap reach dynamics within walled gardens such as Google. The fifth macro vector creating incremental secular tailwinds are changes in the market dynamics of CTV. It's hard not to be bullish about CTV when it's both our largest channel and our fastest growing. Advertisers can see more clearly the contrast of our offering and the role we play with brands and agencies, with walled gardens than ever before. This year, we've really started showcasing the strength of sellers and publishers available on our platform and on the open Internet. We've even published a list of 100 of the best destinations on the open Internet. When you contrast the quality of the open Internet with the perils of UGC, it's easy to see that the best of movies, the best of TV, the best of sports, the best of journalism and the best of music and podcasts represents something more valuable to society and to advertisers and short videos and user-generated content surrounded by comment sections that are often not good for brands. At The Trade Desk, we've also been talking a lot about the premium open Internet because that is where consumers are increasingly spending most of their time. Companies like Netflix, Roku, NBC, Spotify, Disney and Fox, along with many others, have redefined the consumers' Internet experience over the last few years. They all recognize the power of advertising to fund the amazing content experiences that their consumers have now come to expect, and they are all investing in the capabilities to capitalize on advertiser demand. This point is worth reiterating because of some of the macro inventory dynamics in digital advertising. You may recall three or four years ago, I would talk on these calls about inventory scarcity, especially in CTV in the fourth quarter, which was enjoying a significant surge because of people spending more time streaming at home during the global pandemic. As advertisers chased those viewer eyeballs to new streaming platforms, advertising inventory was scarce and with demand rising, CPMs went up. But CTV inventory isn't scarce in the same way anymore. Because over the last couple of years, every major media company has launched a streaming service, and all of them have embraced advertising as a key way to fund their content and grow. As inventory scales and scarcity decreases, advertisers have a lot more choice. They also have a harder job, which is assigning value to a lot more inventory. Now it's about the quality of the inventory as well as the quality of the signal. You may remember at our last Investor Day, that we showed a graph of what our clients were willing to pay for CTV ad impressions on the open market. In many cases, we've been significantly higher than the price that the media companies were negotiating in direct deals. The content arms race is more intense and more expensive than ever and media companies need to monetize their content as effectively as possible. Two weeks ago, Variety reported that the top six media companies will increase content spending this year by 9% to a record $126 billion, all of which needs to be funded. Without the benefit of scarcity, media companies now need to provide advertisers with more insight. What am I buying? Who am I reaching? Tools like UID2 and OpenPath, are helping provide that signal. And it's no surprise that platforms like Fox, who are among the first to embrace these tools are benefiting the most. One major news publisher who has deployed OpenPath, so that they can gain a clear understanding of what our clients are willing to pay, saw their fill rate increase by 7x, leading to a revenue increase of more than 25%. The sixth positive secular force helping The Trade Desk is pressure to make the supply chain better. Advertisers and publishers are two endpoints of the supply chain pressure on the edges, meaning the endpoints, means pressure on the whole supply chain. How is, this good for us is perhaps counterintuitive? There are many players in ad tech that are focused on extracting the highest margin possible. In contrast, we have been focused on adding more value than we cost or charge. We do this because it is the right thing to do, but also because it engenders loyalty from our clients and because it is the very essence of economically sustainable. At this moment, the advertising ecosystem is in the process of refining its supply chain to become definitively more efficient than walled gardens with more objective and independent measurement to prove its efficacy. Companies focused on extraction will likely lose share, while companies focus on adding value will likely gain market share. There are many in our industry, who share, the ethos to add value and we're aiming to partner with nearly all of them. However, there are many that don't. Some who take a more short-term approach and are just looking for arbitrage opportunities or places where they can create the quick illusion of value at the expense of agencies, advertisers or sellers and publishers. I do believe, like most markets that that ad tech will go through a long arc will bend toward market efficiency and transparency. It's just a question of how quickly we get there. And in this moment, we have an opportunity to accelerate that progress. There will be more focus than ever on who is adding value and at what cost to advertisers and sellers and publishers. Continuing the potential prioritization changes happening at Google. In a world where Google is more cautious on the open Internet, a brighter light will shine on the value that everyone provides in the ad tech supply chain. I have long said that everyone in our industry should provide more value to the market than they extract. That's a principle we've always followed. Advertisers are under more pressure than ever to do more with less. Sellers and publishers, which is, of course, our term for content owners and the companies who own that content are fighting harder than ever to take home as much of the CPM as possible and simultaneously increase their fill rates. And they want the advertising ecosystem to be as efficient and transparent as possible. That's why most are so eager to partner with us on initiatives like UID2 and OpenPath. So they can provide advertisers with as much signal and transparency as possible. And so advertisers can value their ad impressions as accurately as possible in the context of reaching their target audiences. The seventh macro vector, that I want to talk about today are the trends happening in audio. I want to highlight that many have wrongly defined the advertising TAM of audio to some sort of comparison to legacy radio. Because the biggest players in audio are global and because digital provides potential for far fewer and more relevant ads, I'm convinced if the biggest players move correctly, they can capture one of the biggest opportunities in advertising and media today, which is the delta between time spent in audio channel and the amount of ad budgets heading to that channel. Digital audio is at the early stages of its evolution. The channel is in a similar position to where CTV was a few years ago. Consumers in the U.S. spend an average of three hours per day consuming digital audio, up significantly over the last five years, and advertisers are eager to capitalize on this emerging advertising channel. At the moment, advertisers are looking for clear trusted signals to inform what they buy. Trust but verify, has become a mantra around the open Internet. Just a few weeks ago, media reported on our major expanded partnership with Spotify. They will be deploying both UID2 and OpenPath, so that advertisers can find as much addressability and insight as possible for Spotify's high-value ad impressions. I don't think there's a company in the media universe that's been more successful than Spotify at building a subscription model. In the audio world, Spotify gives us access to almost all of the world's music for a low monthly subscription. In many ways, Spotify has been at the forefront of this mass consumer shift to digital audio. I think they are in the process of becoming well positioned to get incremental users due to a good ad experience and to get incremental ad budgets for the exact same reason. You only have to listen to their most recent earnings report to understand how seriously they are taking the ad-supported side of their business and building out their programmatic capabilities over the next several years. We are very excited to partner with them in this work and to help our advertiser clients make the most of this fast-growing channel, where listeners are highly engaged and leaned in. Our partnership with Spotify is one of the inventory partnerships that I'm most optimistic about. The eighth macro vector aiding in our outsized growth is the massive opportunity around retail media. To summarize this at a high level, Amazon has showcased to retailers around the world the benefit of using retail purchase data to make retail businesses work better. If advertisers advertise products people like and want and frequently buy at their stores like Walmart or Target or Albertsons or Dollar General or many, many others, those retailers, of course, will sell more product, so do the company is making and selling the products. The significance of this vector and the role it's played in our success the past few years, deserves a much larger space of time, which I expect to do in the coming quarters. The ninth macro tailwind is the changes happening in live sports. Of course, sports is some of the most premium and most expensive content and media. Because it is often scarce and often highly sought out by brands, and it changes very quickly, it really is built for programmatic advertising. The best moments in sports are surprises and unpredictable. That's what makes them so exciting. However, it's also what makes them hard to plan around and to price properly. I expect over the coming years to see programmatic spot markets and sports become best friends. We are enjoying our strongest year-to-date with live sports as the football season has kicked off here in the United States, we are looking at, on average, 1.5 billion ad impressions per weekend. We have dozens of major brands buying football through our platform for the first time and many others increasing spend in the triple-digit range. One example is a major quick-serve restaurant chain here in the United States. This client had been advertising on traditional linear television, but with its customer base, mostly aged over 45 and restaurant visits among that demographic decreasing, they wanted to expand their customer base to reach younger adults and young families using CTV. Working with their agency, Happy Cog and their partner, Clever, this restaurant chain worked with us to target their audience with a specific focus on live football opportunities on CTV, followed up with online video and display, all in an omnichannel approach. Our platform enables the restaurant to target their audiences with precision and use new measurement tools to understand the impact of those ads on brand intent. As a result, this client saw a 15% increase in brand awareness among their target audience and a 9% increase in mobile transactions where CTV was the first ad served. This is a great example of how programmatic on our platform is driving high-value business results. The tenth macro trend helping us grow is this net effect of all of these changes at once. I've said publicly a few times that the biggest thing Google has going for it in its defense against the Department of Justice is complexity. It's hard to make sense of this industry and all of the forces changing it so rapidly. Our clients need help. They are navigating unprecedented change and unprecedented pressure. Fortunately, our buy-side focus and our objectivity aligns our interest with clients and positions us to stand with agencies and brands shoulder to shoulder as we face supply chain changes that ultimately benefit the open Internet and the market, but will require adjustments across the ecosystem. We're here to help and have proven ourselves to be one of the leaders of the open Internet. All of these 10 macro forces when joined with our amazing team, our global footprint, our buy-side focus and our amazing product, including the recent platform overhaul found in Kokai, are showing the early signs of the future promise of our innovations, our objectivity, our AI and our company. Clients are seeing performance upgrades around the world, many of whom are embracing new approaches to objective data-driven measurement The Trade Desk offers. So as we exit 2024 and look forward to 2025, The Trade Desk is better positioned than we have ever been. 2024 has been a banner year for CTV, and we have further cemented our position as the first choice platform to help leading brands as they continue to shift their budgets from linear TV and UGC into CTV. Retail Media has rapidly become one of the fastest-growing areas of our business, a trend we expect to accelerate through 2025. Retail data on our platform is transforming how many CPG advertisers approach measurement and attribution. Innovations in Kokai are helping advertisers identify and target new potential customers with much greater precision. Data elements per impression continued to increase, resulting in significantly better performance helping unlock budgets and win new business. Our premium content partnerships activated through supply path innovations such as OpenPath and the Sellers and Publishers 500+ marketplace, are helping advertisers value and select ad impressions with more objectivity than ever. Innovations like UID2, which has reached critical mass, are helping advertisers pioneer better approaches to addressability in a changing identity environment. And our investments in new measurement capabilities from the TV Quality Index to our growing network of retail data partners are helping advertisers prove the efficacy of their campaigns in new objective ways. Let me conclude by underlining that taken together, these initiatives along with many others, position The Trade Desk very well for market-leading growth in the years ahead. I believe it is worth noting again, we continue to significantly gain market share. I believe our level of relative outperformance, 27% revenue growth in the third quarter is indicative of the value we are delivering to our clients as they deal with an uncertain consumer environment. We continue to sign JBPs with brands and their agencies at a very strong pace with billions of dollars transacted through these partnerships each year now. I believe we will look back on 2024 as an inflection point in terms of how advertisers value the premium open Internet, driven by CTV and digital audio as a compelling alternative to walled gardens. And I expect advertisers will emerge in 2025, more empowered than ever to drive data-driven precision. As a result, we will continue to gain share. And with that, I'll hand it over to Laura to cover our financials. You bet. Thanks, Shyam, for the question. And for the kind words. So first, I just want to point out that the most significant macro vectors that I can talk about are the things that we itemized in the prepared remarks. So we've taken more time this time to talk about the macro vectors that are affecting us, especially into next year in the prepared remarks this time. So I just encourage everybody to spend a little bit more time with them because we spent a little bit more time preparing them. As it relates to the here and now, though, I'm incredibly proud of our performance in the third quarter, and we are currently firing on all cylinders, whether that's what's happening in CTV, it being both our largest channel and our fastest growing, which -- those two things don't usually go hand in hand or the amazing efforts in Kokai. It started the year as an engineering effort and has since turned into both an engineering effort as well as our sales and client services teams getting that adopted. The adoption has been phenomenal. The product is the best that we've ever shipped. So a lot going for us in that. UID2 has become the primary currency of identity in the open Internet. And then, of course, we have so much going for us in retail media and supply path optimization. I really do believe we're in a stronger position than we have ever been. As it relates to the macro market sort of in the here and now, I do want to just highlight that CMOs are dealing with a lot of uncertainty and a lot of scrutiny. And the uncertainty they've seen a lot of over the last few years, but the scrutiny, I don't know that it's been more than they have right now. And as a result, brands are under pressure to grow, and that is good for us. So even though it's a little bit tense for the market, it's good for us because they're turning to us saying, how can we help? And I do want to also highlight that there is a difference between the stock market being at an all-time high and consumers feeling as confident as they've ever been. And that is not where many consumers are especially sort of on the left side of the bell curve. So if you make less than the median household income, then you're more affected by price. And if you're selling products to those people, then it is probably affecting your business more than others. And so as a result, some brands are in a phenomenal position and some are in a more difficult position in this current market as they face inflation and consumer weakness, changes in interest rates and all the implications as to how products need to be marketed. As a result, they need to be more agile, more focused on efficacy, more focus on efficiencies than ever before. And so what we do, which is give them more data and honestly give them control of their own future. It means that they are leaning in more than they ever have before. They're looking for solutions to help them. But when you couple that with why programmatic advertising is the leading source of growth in advertising, which is that, of course, we've been outperforming the market. Of course, it's a place where you can put data to work on a case-by-case basis and optimize for personalization. Of course, when you're using data-driven advertising and marketing, that is the very best place to inject AI in distributed models in the way that we have. And then, of course, when we take our joint business plans and all the other efforts that we have, we're in a really phenomenal position. One other thing I just want to highlight is that political in both Q3 and Q4 was as expected. It's been very strong. And -- but we are mindful that some brands are not as interested as advertising in a polarized political environment. And so those dynamics have made things a little bit different in this Q4 than in other Q4s. One other thing that also gives me a tremendous amount of optimism for the future is that some of our most significant partnerships, whether that's Netflix or Disney or Roku or Fox or Spotify are all in what I would call the crawl phase of our partnership. We've done some amazing themes with some of those. Others, we've always talked about doing amazing things and we've done just sort of testing the pipes. But I think the very best is yet to come in all of those partnerships. And so in the short term, they're making small contributions, but I think the very best is yet to come and all of that, and I'm sure we'll talk about OpenPath and some other things later. But that gives you a sense of what we're facing in the short term. You bet. Thank you. I appreciate the question. So first, a little bit of context. As you know, the Department of Justice already concluded one of its trials against Google on that of search. And the Department of Justice won. And I would argue that the case the Department of Justice has against Google on the ad tech side is even more compelling. It is more compelling, but it's also more complicated, which makes it a little bit harder to predict, but I think the case is incredibly compelling for the government. But regardless of what happens, I believe we will win. And I do want to underline the things that I said in the prepared remarks, Google is a phenomenal company. I think they have a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead of it as it relates to search and cloud and AI and Gemini. But it is clear that they have been deprioritizing network, and it has not performed the way that the rest of their business has. If I were in Sundar shoes, I would deprioritize it too, because of the opportunities that they have on those other fronts as well as just the nature of their business, which is pretty dependent on them making very high margins on media that has a cost of goods sold that is incredibly low. And the premium content of the Internet does not have a low cost of goods sold and therefore, makes it hard to move the needle on a P&L as big as Google's. So I anticipate that they will deprioritize it. But even if they don't, what I think is inevitable is that Google has to play more fair. What has clearly come out in the trial is that they have not always played fair, and that might be the understatement of call. But we have managed to win in an unfair market. I believe they will be forced, whether that's from government or just by their own choosing because this risk-reward is not worth it. So by their own choosing, I think they would make the market more fair and therefore, make it easier for us to do well. So that's why I maintain that regardless of what happens in the trial itself, I believe that we'll do well and that we'll continue to win. I think there are scenarios where the landscape looks very different depending on what happens to Google and regulation, especially on the supply side, which is at the core of the government's case, which underlines the fact that I don't think anybody is disputing as it relates to the trial itself, but The Trade Desk will continue to do well. So I think we're in a great position. I'm very excited to see the outcome, and I think we win no matter what. Thanks for the question. Thank you so much. Appreciate the question. A lot to unpack there. So let me first just give a little bit of history so that you and I bring everyone along in this question. So I love that you know about it because we weren't very public about the gold standard back in 2017, but we certainly talked to SSPs and at exchanges about it. I would essentially summarize that effort as us saying to the sell side, here's the sort of signal that we would like to see, and we are just going to tell you in advance. When we see this signal, we're more likely to bid up because these are the things that give us indication of value. We haven't always done that in the past. But we did start doing that in 2017. As you know, UID2 was an effort to make identity ubiquitous across the Internet. When we first announced it, a number of companies suggested that we would never be successful because they thought we'd have to get 2 billion consumers to sign up for us to have any sort of footprint. And we explained then that our play was not to go sign up 2 billion consumers or to go direct but instead to partner with the infrastructure of the Internet, and we've done that across the board. Then as you point out, in the last two years, we've launched two initiatives. One is the Sellers and Publishers 500+ as well as the OpenPath. Sellers and Publishers 500+ is meant to make it easier for people who are currently buying private marketplaces, which often have really slowed or small trickles of inventory and they don't necessarily realize how much they've limited their decisioning power by only considering a small amount of inventory. So by selecting some of the most prominent and safe parts of the open Internet to buy across all of it. They expand their ability to find value. Because many times, the reason people enter into private marketplaces is simply to be safe. And so we've given them a very safe large ecosystem for them to buy into. And it's something that we'll just continue to promote and make accessible and provide transparency into what, of course, they're buying. But OpenPath, it might be aside from UID2, the most significant venture of all of them. And all OpenPath is, is our willingness to go one step further from gold standard and share with the sell side exactly what we're willing to pay on any given impression opportunity. And the reason why we do that is because there are many publishers who are saying, I don't have any idea what you're willing to pay because of all of the companies that exist between us and it's a way for them to hold them accountable to earn their keep. Some have wrongly assumed that this is us trying to cut them out. It is not. It is us trying to empower the publishers to make certain that they earn their keep. And the reason for that is that we are competing with walled gardens. We're competing with the most successful companies in the history of advertising, companies like Facebook and companies like Google. Those walled gardens have one advantage, which is that they control the supply chain end to end. And therefore, they're not at the risk of players in the middle of the supply chain, extracting too much and then decreasing the value proposition of those that participate in the entire open Internet rather than just in a particular walled garden. And too often, an advertiser pays $1 and less than $0.50 ends up in the pocket of the publisher. So OpenPath is a bit of -- to mix metaphors or to at least use two of them, it's a bit of a light on hill as well as a canary in the coal mine. Buyers get better visibility in the overall supply chain and the reason why I say light on the hill is because we don't necessarily need OpenPath to be on every impression. In fact, we have no expectation that it will. But we will have it run often enough, especially with the largest players on open Internet to know how to grade all the other supply chains, all the other ways that we could potentially buy so that we hold it accountable to be as efficient as possible. The way I view this is it is a race between walled gardens and the open Internet to create the most efficient supply chain. Walled gardens have the advantage on one level, which is that they control at all. But they operate at a disadvantage because they only operate with UGC and they only operate with content that has a very low cost of goods sold and don't have the appeal of all the best parts of the open Internet, which I think we described well in the prepared remarks. The advantage that we have is not only do we have the premium side of the open Internet. But we also have the forces of capitalism of competition, of all things that make markets great that we can partner with so many different companies and through a collection of efforts outperform on any single one company. I don't think you can count on any one company to be a source of all innovation. And we've got a business model that I don't think goes out of style, the way that many destinations do. And so in order for us to be a company that services the entire open Internet. I believe it's essential for us to have a product like OpenPath. So it's a really critical part of our present and future and really appreciate the question, Jessica. So we had a platform to talk about it more. Thanks for the question. You did a pretty good job of laying out all the other key secular drivers for us, the tailwinds that are helping. The first and foremost, over the last few years has been at times anxiety about will there be walled gardens in CTV, , not because we ever thought that was a viable path because I believe that is not a viable path because it's too fragmented. But instead, what all of the major players have come to understand is that when you have a premium product, the very best way to get the most out of it is to auction that off. And of course, to describe it in great detail. When you're not selling an average product, you have to describe it better in order to get the premium that you deserve. And that's true, whether you're selling cars or art or ads. And I would also add that conflict of interest is an even more inferior playbook in CTV than it is in any other channel or any other corner of media. So as a result, I would argue that Amazon operates at a much bigger disadvantage in CTV than in any other channel. So we've argued against Google's lack of objectivity in every other part of the open Internet and they've been less of a competitor in CTV. Amazon has been more of a competitor in CTV, but I think Google was a more formidable competitor in the other parts of the open Internet than Amazon is in CTV and that is simply because of that conflict of interest. They are going to be pushing ads on premium content that they own, meanwhile, neglecting premium content that others own, while we have no dog in the hunt, and we're just trying to help people objectively decide, do I buy the ad on Netflix or do I buy the ad on Hulu or Tubi or somewhere else. So as a result, you take all the partnerships that we put together, and I think those are a significant driver for our growth in the future. A couple of years ago, I would have said that we were leading the CTV market in Australia and in the United States. That's expanded to other markets like the U.K. and to Germany but there are still way more opportunities around the world. As I mentioned last quarter, I was in India over the summer and just the opportunities there in every channel, but especially in CTV and audio are just spectacular. And so the opportunities that exist for us around the world couldn't be better. We've also established UID2, it's not only the currency of the open Internet, but it is especially the currency of connected television. In a way, that's the way it became the currency of open Internet is because of CTV. So what I think is the most significant thing to watch over the next couple of years, is that so many content owners have put ads on their content now that what was once a shortage is no longer the discussion. It's no longer a discussion about scarcity or about shortages of inventory. And so as a result, they are trying to distinguish themselves from each other. This is what has been the case in streaming wars, but now that's also true of the ad experience in the streaming wars. And so they will be describing their inventory better than they have historically. We will have more choice than we have historically. I think that the premium content will do better. I think the content that has identity attached to it will also do better. I think that position CTV to do really well, but there will be a lot of work done over the next couple of years for them to layer identity as well as other metadata to give buyers the very best chance to value it properly and to pay the premium that they need in order to continue to fund their massively expensive content machines. So hopefully, that helps. I really appreciate the question. Laura thanks for the question. I like this one a lot. I didn't see this one coming. So big picture, I believe that the advertising ecosystem around the world is about a $1 trillion industry today, especially when you include retail media. I think it's about that today. Lots of different numbers out there that aren't that too far away from that, but it just depends on whether you include retail in that or not. If you look at what we're doing, $13 billion, $14 billion a year at this point, we're just over 1% of that $1 trillion. I look at it as we have 99% of the pie left and there's so much opportunity for us to do more. As I'm looking at that pie and say, how do we not get distracted by all the different ways that we could go and all the different things that we could build and parts of the pie we could pursue, how do we stay focused, I look at the biggest piece of the pie and say, okay, there's the U.S., there's CTV and of course, up and coming channels like audio, but those represent, I think, the most premium opportunities for us to go pursue. I would point back to the comments in the prepared remarks about, we think that every company in ad tech needs to add more value than they charge or extract. Some of the companies in ecosystem don't think that way. They think about charging rents or extraction. And there's often a mindset that is ride the wave while it lasts instead of how do I build something that really lasts, that I'm adding more value over time, creating more consumer surplus where your consumer or your client gets more value over time and therefore, making it more, more and sustainable and making your customers more and more loyal. I think there's a lot of pressure on the companies in the middle, including some of those that you referenced, and that they have to be focused on adding more value than they extract. I think if we do the right thing for advertisers and then give visibility to publishers that will create a more effective supply chain and that is the biggest impeder or roadblock for our growth is an inefficient supply chain. So we need to make certain the supply chain is as efficient as possible. And that means partnering with all of those companies that are adding more value than they extract and continuing to obsess about the supply chain, but I don't have any worry that we can cannibalize the market. We're 1% of it. So I think there's just so much opportunity for us ahead. Yes. Thanks, Justin, for the question. I think audio is in a slightly different position than CTV, in the sense that when it was a more legacy business, meaning before the Internet changed everything. The distribution models were more around local and the way radio sold ads was just different than the way TV sold ads. And there is less a sense of national. And of course, in CTV now, there's more of a sense of even global. And of course, in audio, there's a very global sense inside of businesses like Pandora and Spotify. So because things are being redefined, I think people have wrongly defined the TAM as being something quite small where when you look at time spent and you look at the amount of engagement with audio content, it is really off the charts and represents a tremendous amount of consumers' time. So that's why I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if companies like Pandora and Spotify and so many others execute well. I think there's just tremendous upside for them. And of course, I watch carefully when I see in their earnings that 10% to 13% of the revenue comes from ads but most of their most of their subscribers or most of their users are asking for ads. And so I think that represents a tremendous opportunity for them. I'm a big believer in Daniel and Alex, and I believe they're on the on the path to get there. But there's a lot of work ahead. There's a lot of development that has to happen. This is going to be a multiyear process but I'm extremely optimistic about what that means for the future and think that it can represent a greater percentage of our business than it does today. And I think that audio can be a bigger percentage of the overall pie than it's arguably ever been before. I don't know that, that will necessarily take or cut into CTV and premium video at all. But I do believe from some of the other channels, it will and should. So I'm pretty optimistic about the future of spot of Spotify and audio, but we all have a lot of work to do. And Dan, as it relates to the part of the question, that was directed to me, the 2024 that was taken out, meaning those advertisers that spend a little bit less in 2024 or Q4 because they don't want to be to be next political, will that back in 2025? Of course. In fact, in many cases, in Q4, it didn't go anywhere. It just got postponed or moved to other channels. So it doesn't necessarily go anywhere just reallocates its form. But in 2025, we think the cycle is a bit more typical and rates are more predictable, then it's also a little bit easier to predict the shape of the curve throughout the quarter simply because you don't have a big change on November 5. You bet. Thanks so much for the question. I'm so proud of what we've done with Roku this year. We've had a long-standing relationship with them, but it's really borne fruit in this year. And it really represents a significant change for them as it relates to adopting things like UID2 and some of the principles of the open Internet. But of course, the Roku channel has grown tremendously for them, and they have become not only a partner for us as a distributor of others' content, but also a premium publisher themselves. I'm so excited by what they've done with UID2 and because of some of the assets they have with ACR and whatnot, I expect our partnership to continue to grow in the coming years. So I'm very optimistic about our partnership with Roku. I expect that to continue to expand and very much appreciate the question. Yes. So it's -- I really appreciate the question because I think this is one of the more nuanced ways that we have just so much opportunity in front of us. And honestly, we were contemplating adding other macro vectors that are helping us and one of them is the state of measurement, which would have been number 11. But the state of measurement is that walled gardens have essentially been grading their own homework for many, many years. And one of the things that they've done really well is convinced people to use their own metrics and kept things quite simple. But at times, that's been really difficult for some of the biggest brands in the world because they'll be told by a walled garden, we help you sell 101 toothbrushes, when the company actually only sold 100 toothbrushes total. So when you have that phenomenon, you start to doubt the credibility of those metrics. We have a very different dilemma or challenge, which is that we've been sharing so much data with them and given them so many options about the way to attribute success and attribute sales we've overwhelmed them with complexity and with numbers and there are so many different ways for us to answer those questions. But because we're committed to doing that with integrity and with objectivity, we'd rather have a conversation with them about how do you want to measure success. There's a whole bunch of different ways to do it. Let us help you put together the one that makes sense for you. So as CMOs and CFOs get closer together and their offices, in some cases, moved closer together. As they get closer together, there -- a lot of our discussions, in fact, some of our biggest wins in last quarter and this one have come from us understanding what the CFO is looking for from the CMO so that we can go back and put together the metrics that prove we're creating incremental sales or growth. So it's largely about figuring out what they are looking for and us getting better at not making everything bespoke and reinventing the wheel. But at the same time, not oversimplifying it, assuming that we have all the answers and just create our own homework with a single metric. So I'm very optimistic about what that means for the future because I do think there is a very important principle that we have been saying since the day we went public, which is objectivity matters a lot today, but it will matter more tomorrow and it will matter more the day after that. And as time marches on, we think that, that continues to be one of our greatest strategic advantages over the biggest names in tech."

            "name": "Laura Schenkein",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. As our third quarter results demonstrate, The Trade Desk is executing at a high level, outpacing peers and capturing increased market share. We achieved robust accelerating year-over-year revenue growth while delivering outstanding profitability and cash flow. Key investment initiatives, including performance advancements in our Kokai platform, expansion in CTV, retail media and supply chain innovations like our OpenPath technology, are not only strengthening our foundation, but position us for durable growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to our results. Revenue in Q3 was $628 million, representing growth of 27% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter and year-over-year. We continue to win more share of our clients' advertising budgets as they increasingly prioritize platforms like The Trade Desk that deliver high-value results, especially in premium video and CTV. This trend is a familiar dynamic in our industry that we witnessed many times over the years. When CMOs faced pressure to achieve more with less, they turn to platforms like ours for flexibility, precision and measurable results. During the third quarter, CTV led our growth from a scale channel perspective once again. We saw strong momentum in retail media as we continue to win incremental shopper marketing budgets. International spend growth outpaced North America once again with notably strong performance in CTV. With the strong top line performance in Q3, we generated approximately $257 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 41% of revenue and free cash flow $222 million. From a scale channel perspective, CTV by a wide margin, led our growth again during the third quarter. In Q3, video, which includes CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30 percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represents around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q3 and international represented about 12%. We are pleased that our ad spend outside North America grew at a faster rate year-over-year than inside North America, as has been the case for the last seven quarters in a row. CTV continued to drive our growth across both EMEA and Asia Pacific. We see significant opportunities to capture more share in these regions in the quarters and years ahead. In terms of verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, growth was broad-based again this quarter. We saw strong performance in the majority of our verticals, particularly in medical health, which includes advertising related to health care and pharmaceuticals as well as home and garden and pets. Political spending was also strong in Q3 as expected. Family relationships healthy living verticals were both below average. Overall, we saw healthy trends across categories, and we continue to believe there is opportunity for us to gain share in all of the verticals we serve. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q3 were $391 million, up 24% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued to invest in our teams, our platform and our infrastructure support sustained growth. Income tax expense was $33 million for the third quarter driven primarily by our pre-tax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $207 million or $0.41 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $273 million for Q3 and free cash flow was $222 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 89 days, down two days from a year ago. DTOs were 74 days, down one day from a year ago. In Q3, via our share repurchase program, we repurchased $54 million of Class A common stock. We will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities. We exited the third quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.7 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV, retail media and political. We estimate Q4 revenue to be at least $756 million, which would represent growth of about 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $363 million in Q4. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter, and we are cautiously optimistic for Q4. We continue to gain momentum across our biggest priorities, delivering profitable growth and significant share gains. As we look ahead to the remainder of Q4 and 2025, we believe we have never been in a better position than we are today. With large growth drivers, including the ongoing secular shift to CTV, upgrading measurement with retail data expansion outside North America, a strong identity framework, strengthening of the supply chain and the ability to drive leverage in our model, we remain optimistic for many years to come. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Thanks for the questions and absolutely happy to answer. We went into the last political cycle, the last big one back in 2020 saying that political spend was in the mid-single digits, and we believe for this year of 2024, it will be in the low single digits as a percent of our overall spend. When we think about how we consider political in Q4 and then go into thinking about how we're modeling going into 2025, it's a really nuanced, but important question this year. Typically, what we see is that Q1 is, on average, a 22%, 23% sequential decline from Q4. And in political years, it's critical to exclude that political contribution in Q4 which we believe, again, will be a low to mid-single-digit percent for that quarter as we go into modeling Q1 of 2025. On the second part of your question, which includes capital expenditures for 2024 and 2025. We've said been consistent that we expect CapEx to increase in 2024 and 2025. But in both cases, it should be around 5% of revenue and that hasn't changed. We invest primarily in two areas. The first thing, our infrastructure, which includes data centers and the second being our offices around the world as we have employees who are coming into work every week. So again, I just want to reiterate there that we don't expect any significant changes in CapEx this year or next year relative to the last few years."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin.\nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to the Trade Desk second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein. A copy of our earnings press release is available on our website in the Investor Relations section at thetradedesk.com. Please note that aside from historical information, today's discussion and our responses during the Q&A may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and reflect our views and assumptions as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly and we expressly disclaim any obligations to update the forward-looking statements made today. If any of our beliefs or assumptions prove incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of risks, please refer to the risk factors mentioned in our press release and our most recent SEC filings. In addition to our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures is available in our earnings press release. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures alongside our GAAP results offers a more comprehensive view of the company's operational performance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff?\nJeff Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you to everyone for joining the call. As you've seen from the press release, we delivered very strong growth once again in the second quarter. Revenue was up 26% to $585 million. Our growth rate significantly outpaced the rest of the digital marketing industry, just as it has every quarter for the last few years. I'm convinced that our success has been forged on the back of consistent, strong 20% plus revenue growth year-after-year for the past several years. By comparison, our ad funded peers have gone through periods of much lower-growth and even stagnation in some cases. That means we are consistently gaining market share quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. And I firmly believe that's because we continue to bring the best innovation and best value to the market. And perhaps more important, I believe that we will continue to outpace the market in the years to come led by areas such as Connected TV, which are only getting stronger. In fact, one of the most bullish things happening in advertising today are evident in our performance. Through the first half of this year, CTV growth has accelerated versus the first half of last year. Before I get into the core of my remarks, let me make a macro observation about the marketing and advertising industry. I've recently been meeting with many CMOs from the world's leading brands around the world, including at the recent Cannes Lions Festival in France. Through all of these meetings, one thing has become very clear to me. These leaders are dealing with a lot of uncertainty. They are looking for answers and they are looking for partners who can help them. The pandemic was the nucleus of a great deal of change for them. The pandemic has been followed by several years of economic uncertainty, whether it's inflation or dramatic changes in fiscal and monetary policies around the world or supply shortages or unpredictable consumer demand. One top CMO talks about the difficulty of what he described as, the illusion of growth, where it appears that companies are doing well, stock prices are up, but the average consumer feels more constrained than ever in terms of purchasing power. That has significant implications on how companies market products from pricing to packaging to advertising. And perhaps more than anything else, it's putting a premium on the efficacy of marketing. More than ever, CMOs have to prove that what they are doing is working. And increasingly, that means revising traditional dependencies on cheap reach and all the legacy mechanisms and beliefs that support cheap reach. It means embracing the power of programmatic data-driven advertising. We are convinced that the only scaled response to all the changes CMOs and agencies are facing is to embrace data-driven buying. To get a healthy and competitive global economy, all roads require scaled programmatic advertising and that bodes well for the long-term prospects of this company, the Trade Desk. As a result of these trends, our relationships with the world's leading brands and their agencies are only getting stronger. It's one of the key reasons we continue to significantly outperform the market and why I believe we'll continue to gain share in the years ahead. I'd like to spend the bulk of my time unpacking this a little. Because I think for most leading CMOs, there is a growing bifurcation in the market. It's being driven by efficacy of new channels such as CTV, by the emergence of new conversion data such as retail data by a growing focus on premium inventory and by rapid advances in the innovation of our industry. Let me start with this point around efficacy. I often talk about how we compete against walled gardens. And to give them due credit, it's very easy for companies to work with big tech walled gardens. They offer easy on-ramps to massive scale in terms of ad impressions with the promise of easy mass reach. And of course, for the most part, they also control the scorecard. So it's very easy for walled gardens to take credit for things like last touch attribution or last click attribution. While in the process, disintermediating a brand and their customer and giving little or no credit to the rest of the marketing funnel. For many marketers dealing with macro uncertainty over the last few years, this cheap reach solution has been attractive. But more and more CMOs, especially those at the world's leading brands have become concerned with the flaws in this strategy for a number of reasons. A few of those. First, much of the mass scale is predicated on cheap, owned and operated content, which is often just user generated videos or social content that is essentially free to produce and ultimately mostly lower quality and higher risk for large advertisers The big tech owners of this content have an inherent incentive to direct demand toward it because the margins on it are so significant. But it's often not where the marketers target customers spend most of their time nor where they're the most leaned in. Second, after several years of uncertainty, the business flaws of cheap reach are more apparent than ever. If a CMO has been going to the CEO or CFO and saying, look, I was able to drive down costs, and the scorecard says it's working. But then a couple of years later down the road, business results are not consistent with those marketing metrics. And as a result, there's a disconnect. This is arguably one of the main reasons that CMOs have the shortest tenure on the C-suite, marketing performance data predicated on cheap reach that doesn't match up with the business outcomes over time. And last leading CMOs at large brands have been leaning into alternatives to this cheap reach that offer much greater efficacy, and by extension, a much closer correlation to business performance. At the center of this is the revolution in TV advertising, driven by the mass shift to streaming TV where advertisers get to target based on authenticated logged-in users. And building on that is the emergence and availability of new kinds of marketing conversion data such as retail data, where advertisers can understand the impact of campaign spend on actual customer outcomes much more clearly. Take HP. They recently came to us to test the efficacy of CTV advertising using UID2. Buying on Disney+ and Hulu on our platform, they were able to drive a 23% reduction in cost per unique household reach, with much greater precision and frequency management. As HP's North America Head of Programmatic, Caitlin Nardi said, using the Trade Desk UID2 solution with our first-party data helped us increase our unique audience reach, boost our cost efficacy and improve how we measure conversions and sales. That's a really great affirmation of the case for the efficacy of CTV, in part because of the embrace of UID2 by most of the major streaming companies. But layer in new data elements such as retail conversion data, and the story gets even stronger. Rossmann is one of the largest retailers in Germany. It's something like CVS in the United States. They worked with us to drive demand for one of their diaper ranges. Using CTV, they were able to drive 170% incremental reach improvement. In addition to that, they were able to understand with precision that every 1,000 impressions served resulted in 20 actual sales. That's a very impressive return on ad spend. They were also able to see the impact of using their own first-party data. When they use that data as their targeting seed, every dollar was between three to four times more likely to drive a sale. When you compare these kinds of efficacy results to the murkiness of cheap reach, it's easy to understand why CMOs are increasingly looking to unlock the power of programmatic on the open premium internet. Let me touch on this point too, the open premium internet. Since we last spoke, we put out a report, the Sellers and Publishers Report. The report kicked off more discussion in our industry than anything we'd ever put out there and I encourage you to download it if you haven't already. The level of industry discussion actually surprised me, in part because I think the report highlighted many of the trends we've been talking about for some time, in particular, where value is shifting on the internet. One of the trends that, that report showcases is the massive shift over the last four years in terms of where consumers are spending their digital time. It used to be that consumers spend about 60% of their time within walled gardens and 40% on the open internet. That trend has completely reversed since the pandemic. Why? Well, in large part, it's because of the mass consumer shift to emerging premium open internet channels such as CTV and digital audio. In the US, over the last decade or so, consumers have doubled the time they spend in these two channels alone to around five hours per day, significantly more than they spend on social media. Companies like Spotify, Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros, Discovery and others have fundamentally changed the way that consumers behave. I would also add that the time that consumers spend in these channels is much more leaned in and engaged than the time spent on channels such as social media. You're much more leaned in when watching the latest hit show or the Olympics or listening to your favorite podcast than you are watching endless short videos of teenagers pulling wheelies on the West Side Highway. To come back to my earlier point, while walled gardens have always done a good job of providing easy access to ad impressions at scale with their own reporting system, today, advertisers have an alternative. For large brands, the premium open internet now rivals walled gardens in terms of scale, thanks to advances in key channels like CTV and audio. But that's where the similarities end. On the open internet, advertisers get to showcase their brands against premium content where their targeted audience is highly engaged and they get to measure campaign performance with much greater rigor based on high levels of authentication and actual consumer conversion data. So while walled gardens still account for the bulk of global advertising spend, we're starting to see many cases where the open internet is commanding the first dollar. CMOs of the world's leading brands also recognize that certain channels, especially digital audio, represent tremendous value, considering the amount of consumer engagement in those channels. On average, in the US, consumers spend around three hours per day listening to music, podcasts and other types of digital audio. And yet digital audio commands a small fraction, by comparison of advertising demand. But that's beginning to change, especially as companies like Spotify make investments to enable more programmatic and automated buying as they highlighted in their most recent earnings call. I would be remiss not to touch on the ever-evolving identity landscape in the context of all of this. What I hope you've noticed in many of our recent reports, including recent earnings reports is that UID2 has been embraced across the digital advertising ecosystem, but perhaps most aggressively by channels that never relied on cookies to begin with, particularly in CTV. UID2 has never been a direct cookie replacement. UID2 has always been about building an identity framework that is much better than cookies could ever aspire to be. It's addressing much bigger issues and is expected to have more ubiquity than cookies ever did or do, an identity framework that works across all digital advertising channels, not just display, and distributes control among many advertisers, publishers and consumers, not just a couple of walled gardens that own browsers. UID2 improves consumer privacy controls while preserving the value exchange of relevant advertising for free content, the essential value exchange of the internet. As most of you probably know, recently, Google announced a change in their long-promoted plans. They reversed their plans and suggested they're no longer getting rid of third-party cookies. I have long predicted that Google would never deprecate cookies. I've never believed it would make much strategic sense for them to do so, and we're seeing that play out now. It's really hard to claim leadership on privacy while also consolidating control over identity, especially when that control is so important to preserving your ad demand in channels such as YouTube all derived from search. I don't know where Google goes from here. We've gone from cookie deprecation to flock to privacy sandbox and back to no cookie deprecation. If you're a company in the ad business that's dependent on Google, and there are many of them, this must be maddening. Understandably so. Google offers are not very compelling and often repeated argument to both the advertising industry and the regulators, both regulators addressing privacy and competition. They argued that privacy sandbox complexity and deprecation of internet functionality was good for everyone. But for The Trade Desk, it doesn't really matter. Our plans haven't changed. We, along with many others, have created the new identity fabric of the open internet, one that is so much more fit for purpose than cookies could ever be. UID2 has already reached a critical mass of adoption, which has made it an essential identity signal, and UID2 continues to gain strong adoption across publishers, data partners and advertisers. For example, FOX is scaling UID2 and OpenPath deployment across their entire digital portfolio, having started with Tubi three years ago. And in recent weeks, we've seen Roku and DIRECTV adopt UID2. These are significant steps forward. Similarly, in Europe, EUID is gaining momentum, with adoption from publishers such as Le Figaro in France, and Reach in the UK, a publisher who boast more than 130 UK newspapers, including The Mirror and The Express. All of this brings me to my third point, the value of innovation in our business. In order to help advertisers think about efficacy in new ways and to help them take advantage of the premium open internet where consumers are most leaned in. After years of development, we launched our most ambitious platform to date, Kokai. Kokai allows our clients to deploy data about their most loyal customers and then use that data as a seed to grow and harvest the next generation of loyal customers. Kokai helps them target those new audiences across the many thousands of destinations that comprise the best of the open internet, and it leverages AI to help them make sense of the roughly 15 million ad opportunities we see every second and the hundreds of variables associated with each one of them. And all of this happens in the context of what any given client's unique business growth goals are. I've been incredibly encouraged by the early results from Kokai. For those campaigns that have moved from Solimar to Kokai in aggregate, incremental reach is up more than 70%. Cost per acquisition has improved by about 27% as data elements per impression have gone up by about 30%. In addition, performance metrics have improved by about 25%, helping to unlock performance budgets on our platform for years to come. So our clients are getting more precise, more cost efficient and then they're able to reinvest for even more reach and drive a much better return on ad spend. Given everything I said about what CMOs today are trying to accomplish and the pressures that they are under, I firmly believe that we have met the moment with Kokai. We are still in the very early days of programmatic advertising. We are just getting started in terms of how data-driven precision will help advertisers optimize every dollar of their ad spend. At end state, all of the rapidly approaching $1 trillion advertising TAM will be digital or at least transacted digitally and the vast bulk of it will be transacted programmatically. And we are thrilled and thankful to be partnering with the world's most forward-thinking marketers as we bring that value to life. We believe we've aligned our interest with theirs, creating a very bright future for both of us. Let me bring my remarks to a close by summarizing what all of this means for us and why I believe The Trade Desk is positioned so well to capture more than our fair share of that $1 trillion TAM. We're in the midst of a period of tremendous change in our industry, change that's the result of macro market pressures as well as rapid innovation such as Kokai. A powerful open internet advertising ecosystem is coming of age, one that provides a compelling alternative to the cheap reach dynamics of walled gardens. That ecosystem includes the world's leading streaming TV and digital audio companies, almost all of whom are partnering with us in new ways. From Disney to Netflix to Roku to FOX to NBC with the Olympics, these companies are trusting The Trade Desk to bring them the most valuable advertising demand. The world's leading retailers and commerce data companies are partnering with us to help advertisers close the loop on campaign spend to consumer purchase. Partners across the ecosystem are working with us to build the new identity fabric of the open internet and we're pioneering new innovations that help advertisers take advantage of their data, target new audiences with efficacy, leverage AI as a copilot and embrace the very best of the open internet. In doing so, we are offering premium value to our clients. And as a result, we are solidifying our position as the default DSP of the open internet. As I've said many times before on these calls, our profitable business model gives us incredible flexibility to make investments and continue to drive growth and to always think about driving innovation and value for the long-term, not just this year or next. Working with our clients and with their needs in mind, we are not afraid to make the big calls. And you see that every day in how we develop our partner ecosystem, how we innovate and how we help clients harness the value of the open internet. I could not be more excited and confident about the powerful alternative we provide to the marketplace today. With that, I'll hand it over to Laura, who will take you through more of the financial details.\nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong second quarter with revenue of $585 million, representing 26% year-over-year growth. During the quarter, we benefited from a relatively stable digital advertising environment supported by both agencies and brands. We continue to gain market share as more advertisers sought greater efficiency and measurable results, particularly in CTV and Retail Media. Our business model, with its wide range of large advertisers and vertical markets, also contributed to our success. Additionally, our growing access to premium inventory, including major events like the Olympics for the first time through NBCU as well as gaining access to platforms like Roku and Netflix also help ensure long-term durability and success, something we take great pride in. With the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $242 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 41% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance throughout our financial statements as was the case again in Q2. I'm proud of our focused efforts to consistently generate meaningful positive EBITDA and free cash flow while continuing to invest in the critical areas of the business that will drive our future growth. From a scale channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q2 and international represented about 12%. We're pleased that international growth outpaced North America for the sixth quarter in a row. Across both EMEA and Asia Pacific, CTV continued to drive our growth. While still small relative to the share of CTV spend produced in North America, we see significant opportunities to capture share in these verticals. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, growth was broad-based again this quarter. We saw strong performance in the majority of our verticals, particularly in home and garden, food and drink and shopping. Family relationships and healthy living verticals were both below average. Overall, we continue to see healthy trends across our verticals and we continue to believe there is opportunity for us to gain share in the verticals we serve. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q2 were $363 million, up 19% year-over-year. While there are ample opportunities to achieve more leverage within our operating expenses, our primary objective remains on growing spend on our platform and gaining more share of the global advertising market. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. Thanks to our careful management of operating expenses in recent years, we are well positioned to innovate our platform, invest in cutting-edge technologies like AI, expand our teams and further distance ourselves from competitors. Income tax expense was $27 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by our pretax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $197 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $81 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $57 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 90 days, down about two days from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, down about one day from a year ago. We exited the second quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In Q2, we did not repurchase any shares of our Class A common stock. We will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities. Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We continue to see strong spend in key areas, including CTV and Retail Media. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $618 million, which would represent growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $248 million in Q3. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter and throughout the first half of the year. The opportunity ahead of us has never been more promising. We are positioned within a large and expanding market, supported by a business model that consistently delivers robust top line growth, significant profitability and strong cash flow. With key growth drivers such as CTV, Retail Media, International expansion, a strong identity strategy and a major product upgrade with Kokai, we remain confident and optimistic about our future as we navigate the second half of this year and look forward to 2025 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shyam Patil with SIG. Shyam, please proceed.\nShyam Patil: Hey, guys. Congrats on another great quarter. Jeff, could you maybe provide your high-level thoughts on the current digital ad environment right now? And kind of going back to what you mentioned kind of at the start of the call, what's allowing Trade Desk to continue to so meaningfully outperform everyone else and gain share? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Shyam. Really appreciate the question. So first let me just talk about our company before I talk about the macro environment. I don't know that I have ever been more proud of our team across the board, not just in our go-to-market teams, but of course, our engineering team and throughout the entire company. I don't know that we've ever been firing on all cylinders in the way that we are right now. And that has absolutely been essential in this environment, because we've never had more change, especially in CTV in a three to four month period than we've had. All good things coming at us, just lots of opportunity, but responding to it all and adjusting to it all is something that I think our team has done really, really well. One thing that I do want to highlight at a macro level that I think makes us different than other players in the space is that we are not a destination and we are not sell-side. So often we get compared to other companies that are dependent on ads, but they are destinations, whether they are an app or whether they're a mobile company or whether they're a website. People are trying to go to those destinations and then they have added inventory that they have to sell in those moments. We are not a destination or a B2B company that represents buyers. So there is a big difference right now between the sell-side and the buy-side. And we're seeing some changes on the sell-side in almost every category, but we are not on the sell-side. We are on the buy-side. And as a result of that, I believe that The Trade Desk is in a stronger position than we have ever been before. CMOs are facing a greater degree of uncertainty than they have generally, but it's really important, I think, to note that we see a relatively stable digital advertising environment, especially when we're comparing that to the macro. Nonetheless, CMOs are being asked from CFOs to deliver growth. CFOs are saying we have to have real growth now and that puts more pressure on the CMOs than ever. And of course they're in an environment with inflation and some consumer weakness and some higher interest rates and a bunch of other macro themes that investors know all too well. But those pressures are actually creating a better macro environment for us. All of those things, including some of the pressures on the sell-side, create a buyer's market. And the pressures on CMOs create data-driven, rational buying, and they're looking to us to help them put their data to work and make more informed decisions. They're being asked to do more with less. They're being asked by their CFO to prove that the ROI is better. It's no wonder they're coming to us asking for joint business plans and say how can we build long into the future, especially when there seems to be no other company in the world more focused on the open internet and helping to monetize that for all the great premium content owners on the open internet, but of course, representing the buyer to help them figure out what is best for them. Of course, we're not immune to the macro changes that we've seen over the last few years, but we are convinced that with our model, our approach and the fact that we're focused on the buy-side, that we will continue to gain share in any environment. It is a buyer's market. We believe it always have been and always will be, in digital advertising, and so as a result, we're in a better position than we've ever been before. Thanks, Shyam.\nShyam Patil: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist. Please proceed.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks for all the color on CTV. I'd like to double-click on that, if you don't mind. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment within CTV with the rise, particularly with the rise of Amazon Prime Video's ad business and the impacts you're seeing on competitors, both in terms of CPMs or pricing and in terms of ad budget shifts? Thank you.\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks so much for the question. So I just want to underline what I said in answer to the last question, which is that we are not a destination, which, of course, is a sell-side function of where you're a content owner and trying to monetize that content. We're instead partnering with all of those and trying to figure out what to buy on behalf of the biggest brands in the world. And by representing the buyers in a buyer's market, we think we're in a stronger position than we've ever been before. As it relates to the competitive nature of the ad environment, I mentioned also in the last question that I don't know that we've had a three or four month period where we've seen more change. I think it's worth highlighting a couple of those. So Netflix announced in that time frame that they will expand their buying capabilities to include The Trade Desk as one of its main programmatic partners going forward. FOX announced an expanded partnership, which I intently work with them personally on this to expand to UID2, of course, and OpenPath across all of FOX brands and the AdRise technology platform. E.W. Scripps is one of the first CTV content owners to adopt OpenPass, which is a new single sign-on that we are launching or just launched. Roku is adopting UID2, of course, allowing advertisers to implement more precise targeting and put their data to work as they're buying media on the Roku platform. And of course, in EMEA, CTV is leading the EUID adoption, with major players like TF1 and M6 in France, for instance. So those that's all just in the last three or four months. But of course that sets a contrast to what you're seeing at Amazon, which I would just say is another rollout of a walled garden. And the reason I say that's in contrast is because all those companies I just mentioned, I would argue that the decisions that they made are to join the open internet, and to recognize that the walled garden playbook doesn't really work in CTV. And the reason why the walled garden playbook doesn't work in CTV is because nobody has enough share to be draconian or even to target well, even to be effective, because of the fact that TV is fragmented. There is no one single player that has anything close to what Facebook does in social or what Google has in search. So as a result, if you house a bunch of inventory there and then don't enable people to bring data to work from other places, it will not perform as well. And so it is true that more inventory has been coming online in CTV, but what sometimes I think is lost, especially in discussions about CPMs is that there is a greater desire for marketers to find their exact audiences than they've ever been or than there has ever been. And they're look they have to look across all these different pools of inventory in order to find the small pieces in each of them that give them the efficacy that they need to be effective and to put their dollars to work as effectively as possible. That's only possible when you're looking across the entire open internet. And when you consider the fact that perhaps our greatest strategic asset is that we are objective that we don't own media. And so as a result, we can help the biggest brands in the world objectively figure out whether they should buy Hulu or Netflix or Spotify or Yahoo. And that objectivity is in greater compromise, I would argue, at Amazon than anywhere. And that's in large part because not only does Amazon have its own owned and operated inventory as it relates to CTV inventory. It also operates as the second largest search engine in the English-speaking world and then it also competes in building products with almost every major advertiser in the world. So that conflict of interest, I think, makes it very difficult. But a biddable marketplace with price discovery, with competition and data is where everybody is heading and I believe that there's no one better positioned to capture the value of that than us. Thanks for the question.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Youssef. Next question, John.\nOperator: The next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nJustin Patterson: Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. And Jeff thanks for that LinkedIn post on chocolate chip cookies the other day. That was great. I guess now that the dust is settling on cookie deprecation in the privacy sandbox, how does your strategy and investment level really change around UID2 going forward? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Thanks so much, Justin, and next time we speak, I'll show you more photos but I appreciate the shout out then and appreciate the question today. First, I don't know that there's a lot more to say about cookies than what I've already said, only because as was pointed out to me by somebody I was interviewing recently and respect a lot. He said one of the things that I love talking to you is it doesn't matter what clips I take from the past. They're always consistent. You said the same thing four years ago that you're saying today. I said in 2020, it was not a good idea for Google to get rid of cookies for that. And I stand by that today. And so because that message has been consistent, there's not a lot new to say. But just to reiterate some of the highlights, cookies were never the best technology to provide personalization. And in a privacy-centric environment, they need to be upgraded. It is not a surprise that privacy sandbox is dead that when you complicate the open internet and deprecate it at the same time and then ask the internet to make huge investments in it, even if you pay them $5 million each, it apparently doesn't work, and that is something that we predicted as they were rolling it out and offered that criticism in private and in public. But I want to be super clear, because occasionally, this point gets lost despite the fact that we've made it again and again. We did not build UID2 as a replacement for cookies. It is way bigger than that. We actually wanted to build an identity framework that can live on irrespective of what Google or Apple or anybody else does. And if there's anything that we've learned from the changes in the last four or five years, it's that Google, in particular, but also Apple, can't be trusted on these issues. And that anybody whose strategy is simply to depend on them and hope for the best, they ought to rethink or at least consider getting a backup plan. And so we built UID2 with the purpose of making something that could live irrespective of the decisions made at Google or Apple. and as a result, it's quickly becoming ubiquitous. Now when I say it's becoming ubiquitous, I especially mean in CTV and in audio, in places where people are logged on. Where there are log-ins, UID2 have been extremely valuable and it is quickly becoming ubiquitous. Where there are not log-ins, which includes, in most browsers, namely Safari as well as Chrome, there's still a lot of work to do in creating authentication, consent and personalization that makes the advertising effective enough to replace the CPMs the way that Google wanted to in deprecating cookies. I believe that's part of the reason why they have created some delay, but that also is a bit of a double edged sword because it could give publishers a sense that they can slow down and take their time, which is not a good idea. Given the efficacy of things like UID2, in order for them to compete, they need to adopt a more sophisticated technology, which puts some pressure on them to continue to change. So hopefully, this doesn't slow them down in that regard. But the bottom line for this, for us, is how does our strategy change is the result of cookie deprecation? Not at all. Thank you so much for the question.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Justin. Next question, John.\nOperator: Yes. The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Please proceed.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you. Good afternoon. Jeff, you spoke about what is going on in the Connected TV market and short-term concerns because of Prime Video entering the space here. I wanted to ask you to talk about what will happen in the next two or three years in the midterm with all the premium inventory sources like Disney, Roku and Netflix and possibly others becoming more available on your platform. How does this impact your revenue growth trajectory in the midterm? Thank you.\nJeff Green: Thanks so much for the question. So I truly believe that The Trade Desk is in a stronger position than it's ever been and I think we might be in the very best position of any player in the market to benefit from the changes in streaming and the move to connect television. I mentioned to the team all the time. I'm way more concerned about the tidal wave of opportunity being too big and that's not being equipped to handle all of the opportunity that comes to us than I am that the wave doesn't exist or it's too small. But if you step back for a second, I believe there's a macro changing of the guard that is happening. It used to be that the first dollar that went to digital went to Google and to Facebook, and that's partly because they built such easy on-ramps, partly because they had so much to scale. They did a lot of things right. But that's changing for a bunch of reasons and not least of which is that most of their content outside of search is not premium. It is user-generated content. And the only reason why I believe that not so many dollars is both because of the easy on-ramp, but especially because it had so much scale and there's nowhere else to go. Now there is. Now there's premium content and the premium content is becoming more and more available. So when the largest brands in the world get to choose between a variety of different premium content owners and then compare that with user-generated content, with measurement that is somewhat suspect to them, it just becomes easier and easier for them to put the first dollar in the open internet, led by CTV and audio, which I would argue those two are the most premium content on the internet altogether. It's no wonder that as they put the first dollar there, that it creates this incredible opportunity for us. Now for a long time, CPMs were very high for these content owners because there was scarcity of supply, especially early on in the pandemic. But as a result of all of them seeing the benefits of ad funded models or at least hybrids where you can have a subscription and also ads and let the consumer pay however they want, they're seeing that they can get incremental subscribers by offering them ads in part because many of them have subscription fatigue and had so many different options to choose from. But we've seen a little bit more of a surge of inventory than we've seen in the past. And so as a result, that requires some restabilizing or rebalancing of CPMs and what gets bought and what doesn't. You ask what's going to happen over the next couple of years. I believe they're all going to get the balance right. They're not going to get too many ads in the commercial breaks and also not too few and consumers are going to be able to pay however they want. And they're going to have access to more subscriptions than they have today. And that will, in large part, be brought to you by ads that will be more effective than they've ever been in television history. And so when you put all of that together, I really believe that we're on the early path to the most effective television ecosystem ever, where you have premium content that is getting funded at rates that we've seen in recent years, but not just on speculation, it's actually being funded and paid for because of these dialed-in hybrid ways that I believe will be better than it's ever been before in part because the content is better than it's ever been before, but also and maybe especially because the advertising itself will be more effective because we can put data to work in a way that never could have happened in linear television. So as we see some of the legacy media companies struggle a little bit, I believe their only way out is programmatic advertising is data-driven advertising that will get them higher CPMs and it will make all of our clients compete to be on their platform, and it will get them incremental subscribers. But I think over the next two or three years, we will see the most effective advertising maybe ever emerge out of the digital advertising space.\nVasily Karasyov: Thank you.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Vasily.\nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Hey, Jeff, I just want to follow up on the question I asked you last quarter, except events have changed. And that had to do with maybe the increasing dislocation in the market related to Google and all the regulatory scrutiny. And since that time, we've obviously had a DOJ decision. We'll probably have another one in the next three to six months and probably be negative two. Google Network is now kind of negative on negative like their revenue base is declining on a base that was declining. And I just wonder if that's what you're seeing in the market and CMOs are really coming to you and looking for more aggressively for an alternative than they were in the past, particularly in light of the regulatory and legal changes that Google is almost certainly going to have to face.\nJeff Green: Thanks, Mark. I really appreciate the question, and you couldn't be more right that the world changed a lot since the last time we talked about this on this call roughly 90 days ago. So, yes, you're right, 2024 is shaping up to be a very big year on the regulatory side and there's probably almost everyone is hearing this knows the Department of Justice won in their suit or trial against Google as it relates to Google Search. And there, of course, is another upcoming trial that will begin likely in September, where the Department of Justice is suing Google over anticompetitive practice in ad tech. In my opinion, the Department of Justice's case against Google on the ad tech side is even more compelling than it was on the search side. Now the one thing that I think Google had in its favor on this most recent case, although it lost, was that it's more simple. It's simpler than the case in ad tech. The ad tech case is quite complicated. But I think it's interesting to point out that one of the things that was under the most amount of scrutiny was the focus on partnerships that were deemed illegal and the payments that Google made to Apple, for instance, that kept them on the sidelines and limited competition. And that at a moment of inflection as Cantor highlighted is a moment where market needs competition, most of all. And as we head into this trial, I believe that same discussion about partnership and especially as it relates to Jedi Blue and Facebook will come up. I think it will come up around open bidding. And the product that Google deployed called open bidding and some of the important mechanics about those auctions that I think will likely be scrutinized, but also the partnerships. But even though I do think that all of that will once again be on trial, I think, there are a bunch of things that we can predict will happen irrespective of the outcome of that trial. One is what you highlighted early on, which is we have historically competed, and I jokingly say, we competed against the 37th highest priority at Google. Not too long ago, we started competing with the 47th highest priority at Google because it was downgraded. And as you point out, the network business, essentially shrinking on shrinking, represents, I think, a deprioritization. And as they continue to upgrade their focus on Gemini and Cloud and AI and Search and YouTube, I think network and open internet is less important to them than ever. I think the cookie decision underscores that same thing as well. So what I think that does create opportunity for us that we haven't seen before in this form. I think it also makes it very possible for us to continue to service the open internet and to continue to be very focused on what we're doing. So as they downgrade their focus on the open internet, that's, of course, been our only focus since inception. So it does create room for us to do more. It does create some uncertainty, especially on the sell-side, which is where they're being challenged in this trial and how that will shape up. But I think the thing that is absolutely certain is that they will be moving more slowly and more carefully than ever. They are a weaker competitor than they've been for us in years past. And as I've often said, we've been winning in an unfair market. Imagine what we could do if we're competing in a fair market. I think as a result of that, I believe, we'll win no matter what the outcomes of this case are, but it will still be fun to watch. Thanks for the question.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks, Jeff.\nChris Toth: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nShweta Khajuria: Thank you for taking my questions. I'll try two, please. First is on Netflix. Jeff, could you please give an update on where you are with their partnership and how should we think about the time line on scaling and perhaps potential contribution as we think about 2025? And then the second one is on your earlier comments, a couple of questions ago on Trade Desk being raised up in consideration by advertisers. So is it fair to assume that the ROIs that they're seeing, the advertisers are seeing now, are very comparable, either even higher than nonsearch social ad dollars that are played and that's why you're gaining share? Thank a ton.\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks for the question. So first about Netflix. I am so excited about this partnership in part because I don't know that there is a partnership where I've had a longer relationship with the C-suite and yet waited so long to have any actual partnership with Netflix. And it's great to see that they've had some early success with ads, and I'm so excited that we now can talk about our formal partnership and the discussions that we've been having for a very long time. First of all, let me just say I'm a big fan of the leadership at Netflix and believe that they are very rational players, and I love that they, in some ways, come with a very objective and open mind as a result of not being a legacy media company of not having ever been in traditional media, but instead, of course, always been essentially a digital player. As it relates to the time lines, we have begun some testing. All we're doing really is putting -- we're putting real money and real campaigns on it, but it's just testing the pipes, nothing that has scaled. I think we'll start seeing that ramp up a little bit this year. But really it's in the next few years that I think we'll see it ramp up and really start to contribute to us and to them, but we'll spend the rest of this year sort of proving it out. And I think next year will be a very important year for the future of both of us and for the future of our partnership. So very excited about that. On the second question, where why is Trade Desk sort of rising in the consideration set for marketers? Part of it is absolutely ROI and return on ad spend and all of those performance metrics and our timing as it relates to shipping Kokai could not have been better as it relates to contributing to those performance metrics. But it's also that premium content like Netflix or Spotify or so many others are coming online and that as we have the opportunity to buy for more quality premium internet destinations, it creates more opportunity for marketers to see returns and to be associated with the most premium content on the internet. And when they have more choices and they can put more data to work because of things like UID2 just the flywheel spins faster. While at the same time, I think they're just a bit more suspicious of the metrics inside of walled gardens. But also the content itself, that user-generated content has been under greater scrutiny, especially as more alternatives pop up. So it's a bit of a double-edged sword. Thanks so much for the question.\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please proceed.\nTim Nollen: Thanks very much. Another question on CTV. I hope you don't mind, Jeff, I'm sure you don't. Given the ongoing weakness that we've seen in linear TV, even through this reporting season through Q2, there was a flood of CTV ads on Amazon Prime earlier this year, and now we've seen Netflix and Roku and others open up to more programmatic CTV. I wonder if you could comment, are you seeing more on the appetite for the CTV sellers to really adopt biddable programmatic, not just delivery of programmatic ads, but actually using auction-based bidded decision programmatic tools? And if you have any observations from the upfront markets that I think are more or less done now as toward as to the seller's appetite towards bidded programmatic. Thanks.\nJeff Green: You bet. Thanks, Tim, for the question. So there absolutely is a greater desire to lean into biddable for both buyers and sellers. So most of television has been transacted over the last few decades the same way that it was decades before that, which is martini lunches and handshakes and parties at the upfront. But you buy in bulk and it was quite literally broadcast. You buy it out and it gets broadcast to all the people in a specific place watching a specific show. And shows were a proxy for audience. You bought football because they are more likely to drink beer, but you didn't know anything about the user in an anonymized way or able to put any data to work. Biddable is the very best way to put that data to work and it's the very best way to get higher CPMs for the content owners. So while, at first, they're a little reluctant because it's a foreign way of doing business, it's just unfamiliar to those in TV, but the math and the CPMs don't lie. And as a result, you're seeing more and more of them embrace that. And as CPM costs have been high, you're seeing the advertisers say, well, why am I paying two or three times what I used to in broadcast if I'm not getting better results or are not able to bring my data to work. So the tolerance to pay high CPMs, if you don't get something more is lower than it was a year or two or three ago. So as a result, both sides are pushing towards biddable and the results are in and it's showing that it is a more effective way to buy and sell. So I think you're going to see the trends push us more and more toward biddable. It does require a lot of work to get to manage fill rates and to do forecasting and you're going to see companies on both sides, being in buy side and supply side, continue to make big investments, in part so that we can continue to run upfronts, but those upfronts will look more like forward contracts than handshakes and partners. And those forward contracts can be always on. And if they can operate in biddable environments where people just have a greater ability to choose, but they also can make commitments and intentions to spend a very large scale while at the same time, getting the right to choose. So we'll see more and more of that in years to come, but the trend is definitely towards biddable. Thanks for the question, Tim.\nTim Nollen: Thanks, Jeff.\nChris Toth: John, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Absolutely. The next question is from Brian Pitz with BMO Capital. Please proceed.\nBrian Pitz: Thank you. Jeff, a lot of discussion around bringing demand to CTV, but any thoughts on timing around bringing more demand to Retail Media and how you see partnerships developing there? And then maybe separately talking about LinkedIn post, you recently said advertisers need an identity strategy and publishers need an identity and authentication strategy. How does Trade Desk best position itself to enable these strategies and transitions essentially for both sides? Thanks.\nJeff Green: Yes. Thanks so much. So on the Retail Media side, there is definitely an opportunity for us to continue to drive spend there. And I've mentioned before that I believe the two greatest threats to walled gardens and the bringing down of their walls are number one, CTV for all the reasons we've talked about on this call, and number two, Retail Media. And the Retail Media is important because it changes the measurement game. So a few times in the prepared remarks and in the comments I've mentioned some of the flaws of measurement inside of walled gardens. But if you're actually connecting the ads that you showed to a specific user and then the purchase that they make later, it becomes much more irrefutable to show the connection between the ad shown and the purchase. And Retail just has tremendous promise for that. And not only is that good for advertisers, but that is also good for retailers who are all trying to find their way to compete in this digital world and to compete with the Amazons of the world. So our partnerships with companies like Walgreens and Walmart and Target and so many others are just great examples of the opportunities that exist in Retail Media, and we have merely scratched the surface. And I'm so proud of what we've done with those companies and the others. You're right. I did mention that every advertiser should have an identity strategy and that strategy can't just be cross your fingers and hope that cookies never go away, and for publishers, they need to have an identity strategy and an authentication strategy. And what I mean by that is when it comes to authentication, if you're not in CTV or audio where 100% of your users log-in, and that's not true of all CTV players, but that's true of most of them, then you need to find a way to get them logged in and to address consent, in other words, ask them, if you can provide them with personal content and create a quid pro quo that makes it worth it. Everybody needs to be developing that strategy, especially if you're in browser right now. So they've been given a bit more time, but they need to use that time to act. And even if Google does nothing more, you have to use that time to act simply because things like UID are so effective for CTV and audio and other channels and for those that have log-ins even in the browsing world that it will make it so that we prioritize that media over those that are just dependent on cookies or something else. So naturally, over time, it becomes very important. And this is more important for those in journalism than anywhere, just because they tend to move very slow and not be technological innovators, so it becomes really important that they respond to that. And advertisers, if you're not putting your data to work with an identity strategy, in other words, how can I use my data in a consumer-friendly way and privacy-centric way, how can I put my data to work so that I can do better marketing? If you're not thinking about that and honoring the sort of sacred relationship that you have with your customers, then you're doing it wrong, and you're likely to lose to those that are doing that. So there's a fair amount of pressure on both buy-side and sell-side to sort of get with the times. And all of this change is happening so fast, but all of that has created opportunity for us at an unprecedented pace, and that's part of the reason why we're so bullish. And when you add the deployment of what I think is our best product yet and certainly the product that I am most proud of our team for shipping in my whole career, not just at The Trade Desk. In Kokai, I just think we have such a bright future ahead. So thanks for the question and for the discussion today from all of you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeff Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank you to everyone for joining the call. As you've seen from the press release, we delivered very strong growth once again in the second quarter. Revenue was up 26% to $585 million. Our growth rate significantly outpaced the rest of the digital marketing industry, just as it has every quarter for the last few years. I'm convinced that our success has been forged on the back of consistent, strong 20% plus revenue growth year-after-year for the past several years. By comparison, our ad funded peers have gone through periods of much lower-growth and even stagnation in some cases. That means we are consistently gaining market share quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. And I firmly believe that's because we continue to bring the best innovation and best value to the market. And perhaps more important, I believe that we will continue to outpace the market in the years to come led by areas such as Connected TV, which are only getting stronger. In fact, one of the most bullish things happening in advertising today are evident in our performance. Through the first half of this year, CTV growth has accelerated versus the first half of last year. Before I get into the core of my remarks, let me make a macro observation about the marketing and advertising industry. I've recently been meeting with many CMOs from the world's leading brands around the world, including at the recent Cannes Lions Festival in France. Through all of these meetings, one thing has become very clear to me. These leaders are dealing with a lot of uncertainty. They are looking for answers and they are looking for partners who can help them. The pandemic was the nucleus of a great deal of change for them. The pandemic has been followed by several years of economic uncertainty, whether it's inflation or dramatic changes in fiscal and monetary policies around the world or supply shortages or unpredictable consumer demand. One top CMO talks about the difficulty of what he described as, the illusion of growth, where it appears that companies are doing well, stock prices are up, but the average consumer feels more constrained than ever in terms of purchasing power. That has significant implications on how companies market products from pricing to packaging to advertising. And perhaps more than anything else, it's putting a premium on the efficacy of marketing. More than ever, CMOs have to prove that what they are doing is working. And increasingly, that means revising traditional dependencies on cheap reach and all the legacy mechanisms and beliefs that support cheap reach. It means embracing the power of programmatic data-driven advertising. We are convinced that the only scaled response to all the changes CMOs and agencies are facing is to embrace data-driven buying. To get a healthy and competitive global economy, all roads require scaled programmatic advertising and that bodes well for the long-term prospects of this company, the Trade Desk. As a result of these trends, our relationships with the world's leading brands and their agencies are only getting stronger. It's one of the key reasons we continue to significantly outperform the market and why I believe we'll continue to gain share in the years ahead. I'd like to spend the bulk of my time unpacking this a little. Because I think for most leading CMOs, there is a growing bifurcation in the market. It's being driven by efficacy of new channels such as CTV, by the emergence of new conversion data such as retail data by a growing focus on premium inventory and by rapid advances in the innovation of our industry. Let me start with this point around efficacy. I often talk about how we compete against walled gardens. And to give them due credit, it's very easy for companies to work with big tech walled gardens. They offer easy on-ramps to massive scale in terms of ad impressions with the promise of easy mass reach. And of course, for the most part, they also control the scorecard. So it's very easy for walled gardens to take credit for things like last touch attribution or last click attribution. While in the process, disintermediating a brand and their customer and giving little or no credit to the rest of the marketing funnel. For many marketers dealing with macro uncertainty over the last few years, this cheap reach solution has been attractive. But more and more CMOs, especially those at the world's leading brands have become concerned with the flaws in this strategy for a number of reasons. A few of those. First, much of the mass scale is predicated on cheap, owned and operated content, which is often just user generated videos or social content that is essentially free to produce and ultimately mostly lower quality and higher risk for large advertisers The big tech owners of this content have an inherent incentive to direct demand toward it because the margins on it are so significant. But it's often not where the marketers target customers spend most of their time nor where they're the most leaned in. Second, after several years of uncertainty, the business flaws of cheap reach are more apparent than ever. If a CMO has been going to the CEO or CFO and saying, look, I was able to drive down costs, and the scorecard says it's working. But then a couple of years later down the road, business results are not consistent with those marketing metrics. And as a result, there's a disconnect. This is arguably one of the main reasons that CMOs have the shortest tenure on the C-suite, marketing performance data predicated on cheap reach that doesn't match up with the business outcomes over time. And last leading CMOs at large brands have been leaning into alternatives to this cheap reach that offer much greater efficacy, and by extension, a much closer correlation to business performance. At the center of this is the revolution in TV advertising, driven by the mass shift to streaming TV where advertisers get to target based on authenticated logged-in users. And building on that is the emergence and availability of new kinds of marketing conversion data such as retail data, where advertisers can understand the impact of campaign spend on actual customer outcomes much more clearly. Take HP. They recently came to us to test the efficacy of CTV advertising using UID2. Buying on Disney+ and Hulu on our platform, they were able to drive a 23% reduction in cost per unique household reach, with much greater precision and frequency management. As HP's North America Head of Programmatic, Caitlin Nardi said, using the Trade Desk UID2 solution with our first-party data helped us increase our unique audience reach, boost our cost efficacy and improve how we measure conversions and sales. That's a really great affirmation of the case for the efficacy of CTV, in part because of the embrace of UID2 by most of the major streaming companies. But layer in new data elements such as retail conversion data, and the story gets even stronger. Rossmann is one of the largest retailers in Germany. It's something like CVS in the United States. They worked with us to drive demand for one of their diaper ranges. Using CTV, they were able to drive 170% incremental reach improvement. In addition to that, they were able to understand with precision that every 1,000 impressions served resulted in 20 actual sales. That's a very impressive return on ad spend. They were also able to see the impact of using their own first-party data. When they use that data as their targeting seed, every dollar was between three to four times more likely to drive a sale. When you compare these kinds of efficacy results to the murkiness of cheap reach, it's easy to understand why CMOs are increasingly looking to unlock the power of programmatic on the open premium internet. Let me touch on this point too, the open premium internet. Since we last spoke, we put out a report, the Sellers and Publishers Report. The report kicked off more discussion in our industry than anything we'd ever put out there and I encourage you to download it if you haven't already. The level of industry discussion actually surprised me, in part because I think the report highlighted many of the trends we've been talking about for some time, in particular, where value is shifting on the internet. One of the trends that, that report showcases is the massive shift over the last four years in terms of where consumers are spending their digital time. It used to be that consumers spend about 60% of their time within walled gardens and 40% on the open internet. That trend has completely reversed since the pandemic. Why? Well, in large part, it's because of the mass consumer shift to emerging premium open internet channels such as CTV and digital audio. In the US, over the last decade or so, consumers have doubled the time they spend in these two channels alone to around five hours per day, significantly more than they spend on social media. Companies like Spotify, Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros, Discovery and others have fundamentally changed the way that consumers behave. I would also add that the time that consumers spend in these channels is much more leaned in and engaged than the time spent on channels such as social media. You're much more leaned in when watching the latest hit show or the Olympics or listening to your favorite podcast than you are watching endless short videos of teenagers pulling wheelies on the West Side Highway. To come back to my earlier point, while walled gardens have always done a good job of providing easy access to ad impressions at scale with their own reporting system, today, advertisers have an alternative. For large brands, the premium open internet now rivals walled gardens in terms of scale, thanks to advances in key channels like CTV and audio. But that's where the similarities end. On the open internet, advertisers get to showcase their brands against premium content where their targeted audience is highly engaged and they get to measure campaign performance with much greater rigor based on high levels of authentication and actual consumer conversion data. So while walled gardens still account for the bulk of global advertising spend, we're starting to see many cases where the open internet is commanding the first dollar. CMOs of the world's leading brands also recognize that certain channels, especially digital audio, represent tremendous value, considering the amount of consumer engagement in those channels. On average, in the US, consumers spend around three hours per day listening to music, podcasts and other types of digital audio. And yet digital audio commands a small fraction, by comparison of advertising demand. But that's beginning to change, especially as companies like Spotify make investments to enable more programmatic and automated buying as they highlighted in their most recent earnings call. I would be remiss not to touch on the ever-evolving identity landscape in the context of all of this. What I hope you've noticed in many of our recent reports, including recent earnings reports is that UID2 has been embraced across the digital advertising ecosystem, but perhaps most aggressively by channels that never relied on cookies to begin with, particularly in CTV. UID2 has never been a direct cookie replacement. UID2 has always been about building an identity framework that is much better than cookies could ever aspire to be. It's addressing much bigger issues and is expected to have more ubiquity than cookies ever did or do, an identity framework that works across all digital advertising channels, not just display, and distributes control among many advertisers, publishers and consumers, not just a couple of walled gardens that own browsers. UID2 improves consumer privacy controls while preserving the value exchange of relevant advertising for free content, the essential value exchange of the internet. As most of you probably know, recently, Google announced a change in their long-promoted plans. They reversed their plans and suggested they're no longer getting rid of third-party cookies. I have long predicted that Google would never deprecate cookies. I've never believed it would make much strategic sense for them to do so, and we're seeing that play out now. It's really hard to claim leadership on privacy while also consolidating control over identity, especially when that control is so important to preserving your ad demand in channels such as YouTube all derived from search. I don't know where Google goes from here. We've gone from cookie deprecation to flock to privacy sandbox and back to no cookie deprecation. If you're a company in the ad business that's dependent on Google, and there are many of them, this must be maddening. Understandably so. Google offers are not very compelling and often repeated argument to both the advertising industry and the regulators, both regulators addressing privacy and competition. They argued that privacy sandbox complexity and deprecation of internet functionality was good for everyone. But for The Trade Desk, it doesn't really matter. Our plans haven't changed. We, along with many others, have created the new identity fabric of the open internet, one that is so much more fit for purpose than cookies could ever be. UID2 has already reached a critical mass of adoption, which has made it an essential identity signal, and UID2 continues to gain strong adoption across publishers, data partners and advertisers. For example, FOX is scaling UID2 and OpenPath deployment across their entire digital portfolio, having started with Tubi three years ago. And in recent weeks, we've seen Roku and DIRECTV adopt UID2. These are significant steps forward. Similarly, in Europe, EUID is gaining momentum, with adoption from publishers such as Le Figaro in France, and Reach in the UK, a publisher who boast more than 130 UK newspapers, including The Mirror and The Express. All of this brings me to my third point, the value of innovation in our business. In order to help advertisers think about efficacy in new ways and to help them take advantage of the premium open internet where consumers are most leaned in. After years of development, we launched our most ambitious platform to date, Kokai. Kokai allows our clients to deploy data about their most loyal customers and then use that data as a seed to grow and harvest the next generation of loyal customers. Kokai helps them target those new audiences across the many thousands of destinations that comprise the best of the open internet, and it leverages AI to help them make sense of the roughly 15 million ad opportunities we see every second and the hundreds of variables associated with each one of them. And all of this happens in the context of what any given client's unique business growth goals are. I've been incredibly encouraged by the early results from Kokai. For those campaigns that have moved from Solimar to Kokai in aggregate, incremental reach is up more than 70%. Cost per acquisition has improved by about 27% as data elements per impression have gone up by about 30%. In addition, performance metrics have improved by about 25%, helping to unlock performance budgets on our platform for years to come. So our clients are getting more precise, more cost efficient and then they're able to reinvest for even more reach and drive a much better return on ad spend. Given everything I said about what CMOs today are trying to accomplish and the pressures that they are under, I firmly believe that we have met the moment with Kokai. We are still in the very early days of programmatic advertising. We are just getting started in terms of how data-driven precision will help advertisers optimize every dollar of their ad spend. At end state, all of the rapidly approaching $1 trillion advertising TAM will be digital or at least transacted digitally and the vast bulk of it will be transacted programmatically. And we are thrilled and thankful to be partnering with the world's most forward-thinking marketers as we bring that value to life. We believe we've aligned our interest with theirs, creating a very bright future for both of us. Let me bring my remarks to a close by summarizing what all of this means for us and why I believe The Trade Desk is positioned so well to capture more than our fair share of that $1 trillion TAM. We're in the midst of a period of tremendous change in our industry, change that's the result of macro market pressures as well as rapid innovation such as Kokai. A powerful open internet advertising ecosystem is coming of age, one that provides a compelling alternative to the cheap reach dynamics of walled gardens. That ecosystem includes the world's leading streaming TV and digital audio companies, almost all of whom are partnering with us in new ways. From Disney to Netflix to Roku to FOX to NBC with the Olympics, these companies are trusting The Trade Desk to bring them the most valuable advertising demand. The world's leading retailers and commerce data companies are partnering with us to help advertisers close the loop on campaign spend to consumer purchase. Partners across the ecosystem are working with us to build the new identity fabric of the open internet and we're pioneering new innovations that help advertisers take advantage of their data, target new audiences with efficacy, leverage AI as a copilot and embrace the very best of the open internet. In doing so, we are offering premium value to our clients. And as a result, we are solidifying our position as the default DSP of the open internet. As I've said many times before on these calls, our profitable business model gives us incredible flexibility to make investments and continue to drive growth and to always think about driving innovation and value for the long-term, not just this year or next. Working with our clients and with their needs in mind, we are not afraid to make the big calls. And you see that every day in how we develop our partner ecosystem, how we innovate and how we help clients harness the value of the open internet. I could not be more excited and confident about the powerful alternative we provide to the marketplace today. With that, I'll hand it over to Laura, who will take you through more of the financial details. Thanks, Shyam. Really appreciate the question. So first let me just talk about our company before I talk about the macro environment. I don't know that I have ever been more proud of our team across the board, not just in our go-to-market teams, but of course, our engineering team and throughout the entire company. I don't know that we've ever been firing on all cylinders in the way that we are right now. And that has absolutely been essential in this environment, because we've never had more change, especially in CTV in a three to four month period than we've had. All good things coming at us, just lots of opportunity, but responding to it all and adjusting to it all is something that I think our team has done really, really well. One thing that I do want to highlight at a macro level that I think makes us different than other players in the space is that we are not a destination and we are not sell-side. So often we get compared to other companies that are dependent on ads, but they are destinations, whether they are an app or whether they're a mobile company or whether they're a website. People are trying to go to those destinations and then they have added inventory that they have to sell in those moments. We are not a destination or a B2B company that represents buyers. So there is a big difference right now between the sell-side and the buy-side. And we're seeing some changes on the sell-side in almost every category, but we are not on the sell-side. We are on the buy-side. And as a result of that, I believe that The Trade Desk is in a stronger position than we have ever been before. CMOs are facing a greater degree of uncertainty than they have generally, but it's really important, I think, to note that we see a relatively stable digital advertising environment, especially when we're comparing that to the macro. Nonetheless, CMOs are being asked from CFOs to deliver growth. CFOs are saying we have to have real growth now and that puts more pressure on the CMOs than ever. And of course they're in an environment with inflation and some consumer weakness and some higher interest rates and a bunch of other macro themes that investors know all too well. But those pressures are actually creating a better macro environment for us. All of those things, including some of the pressures on the sell-side, create a buyer's market. And the pressures on CMOs create data-driven, rational buying, and they're looking to us to help them put their data to work and make more informed decisions. They're being asked to do more with less. They're being asked by their CFO to prove that the ROI is better. It's no wonder they're coming to us asking for joint business plans and say how can we build long into the future, especially when there seems to be no other company in the world more focused on the open internet and helping to monetize that for all the great premium content owners on the open internet, but of course, representing the buyer to help them figure out what is best for them. Of course, we're not immune to the macro changes that we've seen over the last few years, but we are convinced that with our model, our approach and the fact that we're focused on the buy-side, that we will continue to gain share in any environment. It is a buyer's market. We believe it always have been and always will be, in digital advertising, and so as a result, we're in a better position than we've ever been before. Thanks, Shyam. You bet. Thanks so much for the question. So I just want to underline what I said in answer to the last question, which is that we are not a destination, which, of course, is a sell-side function of where you're a content owner and trying to monetize that content. We're instead partnering with all of those and trying to figure out what to buy on behalf of the biggest brands in the world. And by representing the buyers in a buyer's market, we think we're in a stronger position than we've ever been before. As it relates to the competitive nature of the ad environment, I mentioned also in the last question that I don't know that we've had a three or four month period where we've seen more change. I think it's worth highlighting a couple of those. So Netflix announced in that time frame that they will expand their buying capabilities to include The Trade Desk as one of its main programmatic partners going forward. FOX announced an expanded partnership, which I intently work with them personally on this to expand to UID2, of course, and OpenPath across all of FOX brands and the AdRise technology platform. E.W. Scripps is one of the first CTV content owners to adopt OpenPass, which is a new single sign-on that we are launching or just launched. Roku is adopting UID2, of course, allowing advertisers to implement more precise targeting and put their data to work as they're buying media on the Roku platform. And of course, in EMEA, CTV is leading the EUID adoption, with major players like TF1 and M6 in France, for instance. So those that's all just in the last three or four months. But of course that sets a contrast to what you're seeing at Amazon, which I would just say is another rollout of a walled garden. And the reason I say that's in contrast is because all those companies I just mentioned, I would argue that the decisions that they made are to join the open internet, and to recognize that the walled garden playbook doesn't really work in CTV. And the reason why the walled garden playbook doesn't work in CTV is because nobody has enough share to be draconian or even to target well, even to be effective, because of the fact that TV is fragmented. There is no one single player that has anything close to what Facebook does in social or what Google has in search. So as a result, if you house a bunch of inventory there and then don't enable people to bring data to work from other places, it will not perform as well. And so it is true that more inventory has been coming online in CTV, but what sometimes I think is lost, especially in discussions about CPMs is that there is a greater desire for marketers to find their exact audiences than they've ever been or than there has ever been. And they're look they have to look across all these different pools of inventory in order to find the small pieces in each of them that give them the efficacy that they need to be effective and to put their dollars to work as effectively as possible. That's only possible when you're looking across the entire open internet. And when you consider the fact that perhaps our greatest strategic asset is that we are objective that we don't own media. And so as a result, we can help the biggest brands in the world objectively figure out whether they should buy Hulu or Netflix or Spotify or Yahoo. And that objectivity is in greater compromise, I would argue, at Amazon than anywhere. And that's in large part because not only does Amazon have its own owned and operated inventory as it relates to CTV inventory. It also operates as the second largest search engine in the English-speaking world and then it also competes in building products with almost every major advertiser in the world. So that conflict of interest, I think, makes it very difficult. But a biddable marketplace with price discovery, with competition and data is where everybody is heading and I believe that there's no one better positioned to capture the value of that than us. Thanks for the question. Thanks so much, Justin, and next time we speak, I'll show you more photos but I appreciate the shout out then and appreciate the question today. First, I don't know that there's a lot more to say about cookies than what I've already said, only because as was pointed out to me by somebody I was interviewing recently and respect a lot. He said one of the things that I love talking to you is it doesn't matter what clips I take from the past. They're always consistent. You said the same thing four years ago that you're saying today. I said in 2020, it was not a good idea for Google to get rid of cookies for that. And I stand by that today. And so because that message has been consistent, there's not a lot new to say. But just to reiterate some of the highlights, cookies were never the best technology to provide personalization. And in a privacy-centric environment, they need to be upgraded. It is not a surprise that privacy sandbox is dead that when you complicate the open internet and deprecate it at the same time and then ask the internet to make huge investments in it, even if you pay them $5 million each, it apparently doesn't work, and that is something that we predicted as they were rolling it out and offered that criticism in private and in public. But I want to be super clear, because occasionally, this point gets lost despite the fact that we've made it again and again. We did not build UID2 as a replacement for cookies. It is way bigger than that. We actually wanted to build an identity framework that can live on irrespective of what Google or Apple or anybody else does. And if there's anything that we've learned from the changes in the last four or five years, it's that Google, in particular, but also Apple, can't be trusted on these issues. And that anybody whose strategy is simply to depend on them and hope for the best, they ought to rethink or at least consider getting a backup plan. And so we built UID2 with the purpose of making something that could live irrespective of the decisions made at Google or Apple. and as a result, it's quickly becoming ubiquitous. Now when I say it's becoming ubiquitous, I especially mean in CTV and in audio, in places where people are logged on. Where there are log-ins, UID2 have been extremely valuable and it is quickly becoming ubiquitous. Where there are not log-ins, which includes, in most browsers, namely Safari as well as Chrome, there's still a lot of work to do in creating authentication, consent and personalization that makes the advertising effective enough to replace the CPMs the way that Google wanted to in deprecating cookies. I believe that's part of the reason why they have created some delay, but that also is a bit of a double edged sword because it could give publishers a sense that they can slow down and take their time, which is not a good idea. Given the efficacy of things like UID2, in order for them to compete, they need to adopt a more sophisticated technology, which puts some pressure on them to continue to change. So hopefully, this doesn't slow them down in that regard. But the bottom line for this, for us, is how does our strategy change is the result of cookie deprecation? Not at all. Thank you so much for the question. Thanks so much for the question. So I truly believe that The Trade Desk is in a stronger position than it's ever been and I think we might be in the very best position of any player in the market to benefit from the changes in streaming and the move to connect television. I mentioned to the team all the time. I'm way more concerned about the tidal wave of opportunity being too big and that's not being equipped to handle all of the opportunity that comes to us than I am that the wave doesn't exist or it's too small. But if you step back for a second, I believe there's a macro changing of the guard that is happening. It used to be that the first dollar that went to digital went to Google and to Facebook, and that's partly because they built such easy on-ramps, partly because they had so much to scale. They did a lot of things right. But that's changing for a bunch of reasons and not least of which is that most of their content outside of search is not premium. It is user-generated content. And the only reason why I believe that not so many dollars is both because of the easy on-ramp, but especially because it had so much scale and there's nowhere else to go. Now there is. Now there's premium content and the premium content is becoming more and more available. So when the largest brands in the world get to choose between a variety of different premium content owners and then compare that with user-generated content, with measurement that is somewhat suspect to them, it just becomes easier and easier for them to put the first dollar in the open internet, led by CTV and audio, which I would argue those two are the most premium content on the internet altogether. It's no wonder that as they put the first dollar there, that it creates this incredible opportunity for us. Now for a long time, CPMs were very high for these content owners because there was scarcity of supply, especially early on in the pandemic. But as a result of all of them seeing the benefits of ad funded models or at least hybrids where you can have a subscription and also ads and let the consumer pay however they want, they're seeing that they can get incremental subscribers by offering them ads in part because many of them have subscription fatigue and had so many different options to choose from. But we've seen a little bit more of a surge of inventory than we've seen in the past. And so as a result, that requires some restabilizing or rebalancing of CPMs and what gets bought and what doesn't. You ask what's going to happen over the next couple of years. I believe they're all going to get the balance right. They're not going to get too many ads in the commercial breaks and also not too few and consumers are going to be able to pay however they want. And they're going to have access to more subscriptions than they have today. And that will, in large part, be brought to you by ads that will be more effective than they've ever been in television history. And so when you put all of that together, I really believe that we're on the early path to the most effective television ecosystem ever, where you have premium content that is getting funded at rates that we've seen in recent years, but not just on speculation, it's actually being funded and paid for because of these dialed-in hybrid ways that I believe will be better than it's ever been before in part because the content is better than it's ever been before, but also and maybe especially because the advertising itself will be more effective because we can put data to work in a way that never could have happened in linear television. So as we see some of the legacy media companies struggle a little bit, I believe their only way out is programmatic advertising is data-driven advertising that will get them higher CPMs and it will make all of our clients compete to be on their platform, and it will get them incremental subscribers. But I think over the next two or three years, we will see the most effective advertising maybe ever emerge out of the digital advertising space. Thanks, Mark. I really appreciate the question, and you couldn't be more right that the world changed a lot since the last time we talked about this on this call roughly 90 days ago. So, yes, you're right, 2024 is shaping up to be a very big year on the regulatory side and there's probably almost everyone is hearing this knows the Department of Justice won in their suit or trial against Google as it relates to Google Search. And there, of course, is another upcoming trial that will begin likely in September, where the Department of Justice is suing Google over anticompetitive practice in ad tech. In my opinion, the Department of Justice's case against Google on the ad tech side is even more compelling than it was on the search side. Now the one thing that I think Google had in its favor on this most recent case, although it lost, was that it's more simple. It's simpler than the case in ad tech. The ad tech case is quite complicated. But I think it's interesting to point out that one of the things that was under the most amount of scrutiny was the focus on partnerships that were deemed illegal and the payments that Google made to Apple, for instance, that kept them on the sidelines and limited competition. And that at a moment of inflection as Cantor highlighted is a moment where market needs competition, most of all. And as we head into this trial, I believe that same discussion about partnership and especially as it relates to Jedi Blue and Facebook will come up. I think it will come up around open bidding. And the product that Google deployed called open bidding and some of the important mechanics about those auctions that I think will likely be scrutinized, but also the partnerships. But even though I do think that all of that will once again be on trial, I think, there are a bunch of things that we can predict will happen irrespective of the outcome of that trial. One is what you highlighted early on, which is we have historically competed, and I jokingly say, we competed against the 37th highest priority at Google. Not too long ago, we started competing with the 47th highest priority at Google because it was downgraded. And as you point out, the network business, essentially shrinking on shrinking, represents, I think, a deprioritization. And as they continue to upgrade their focus on Gemini and Cloud and AI and Search and YouTube, I think network and open internet is less important to them than ever. I think the cookie decision underscores that same thing as well. So what I think that does create opportunity for us that we haven't seen before in this form. I think it also makes it very possible for us to continue to service the open internet and to continue to be very focused on what we're doing. So as they downgrade their focus on the open internet, that's, of course, been our only focus since inception. So it does create room for us to do more. It does create some uncertainty, especially on the sell-side, which is where they're being challenged in this trial and how that will shape up. But I think the thing that is absolutely certain is that they will be moving more slowly and more carefully than ever. They are a weaker competitor than they've been for us in years past. And as I've often said, we've been winning in an unfair market. Imagine what we could do if we're competing in a fair market. I think as a result of that, I believe, we'll win no matter what the outcomes of this case are, but it will still be fun to watch. Thanks for the question. You bet. Thanks for the question. So first about Netflix. I am so excited about this partnership in part because I don't know that there is a partnership where I've had a longer relationship with the C-suite and yet waited so long to have any actual partnership with Netflix. And it's great to see that they've had some early success with ads, and I'm so excited that we now can talk about our formal partnership and the discussions that we've been having for a very long time. First of all, let me just say I'm a big fan of the leadership at Netflix and believe that they are very rational players, and I love that they, in some ways, come with a very objective and open mind as a result of not being a legacy media company of not having ever been in traditional media, but instead, of course, always been essentially a digital player. As it relates to the time lines, we have begun some testing. All we're doing really is putting -- we're putting real money and real campaigns on it, but it's just testing the pipes, nothing that has scaled. I think we'll start seeing that ramp up a little bit this year. But really it's in the next few years that I think we'll see it ramp up and really start to contribute to us and to them, but we'll spend the rest of this year sort of proving it out. And I think next year will be a very important year for the future of both of us and for the future of our partnership. So very excited about that. On the second question, where why is Trade Desk sort of rising in the consideration set for marketers? Part of it is absolutely ROI and return on ad spend and all of those performance metrics and our timing as it relates to shipping Kokai could not have been better as it relates to contributing to those performance metrics. But it's also that premium content like Netflix or Spotify or so many others are coming online and that as we have the opportunity to buy for more quality premium internet destinations, it creates more opportunity for marketers to see returns and to be associated with the most premium content on the internet. And when they have more choices and they can put more data to work because of things like UID2 just the flywheel spins faster. While at the same time, I think they're just a bit more suspicious of the metrics inside of walled gardens. But also the content itself, that user-generated content has been under greater scrutiny, especially as more alternatives pop up. So it's a bit of a double-edged sword. Thanks so much for the question. You bet. Thanks, Tim, for the question. So there absolutely is a greater desire to lean into biddable for both buyers and sellers. So most of television has been transacted over the last few decades the same way that it was decades before that, which is martini lunches and handshakes and parties at the upfront. But you buy in bulk and it was quite literally broadcast. You buy it out and it gets broadcast to all the people in a specific place watching a specific show. And shows were a proxy for audience. You bought football because they are more likely to drink beer, but you didn't know anything about the user in an anonymized way or able to put any data to work. Biddable is the very best way to put that data to work and it's the very best way to get higher CPMs for the content owners. So while, at first, they're a little reluctant because it's a foreign way of doing business, it's just unfamiliar to those in TV, but the math and the CPMs don't lie. And as a result, you're seeing more and more of them embrace that. And as CPM costs have been high, you're seeing the advertisers say, well, why am I paying two or three times what I used to in broadcast if I'm not getting better results or are not able to bring my data to work. So the tolerance to pay high CPMs, if you don't get something more is lower than it was a year or two or three ago. So as a result, both sides are pushing towards biddable and the results are in and it's showing that it is a more effective way to buy and sell. So I think you're going to see the trends push us more and more toward biddable. It does require a lot of work to get to manage fill rates and to do forecasting and you're going to see companies on both sides, being in buy side and supply side, continue to make big investments, in part so that we can continue to run upfronts, but those upfronts will look more like forward contracts than handshakes and partners. And those forward contracts can be always on. And if they can operate in biddable environments where people just have a greater ability to choose, but they also can make commitments and intentions to spend a very large scale while at the same time, getting the right to choose. So we'll see more and more of that in years to come, but the trend is definitely towards biddable. Thanks for the question, Tim. Yes. Thanks so much. So on the Retail Media side, there is definitely an opportunity for us to continue to drive spend there. And I've mentioned before that I believe the two greatest threats to walled gardens and the bringing down of their walls are number one, CTV for all the reasons we've talked about on this call, and number two, Retail Media. And the Retail Media is important because it changes the measurement game. So a few times in the prepared remarks and in the comments I've mentioned some of the flaws of measurement inside of walled gardens. But if you're actually connecting the ads that you showed to a specific user and then the purchase that they make later, it becomes much more irrefutable to show the connection between the ad shown and the purchase. And Retail just has tremendous promise for that. And not only is that good for advertisers, but that is also good for retailers who are all trying to find their way to compete in this digital world and to compete with the Amazons of the world. So our partnerships with companies like Walgreens and Walmart and Target and so many others are just great examples of the opportunities that exist in Retail Media, and we have merely scratched the surface. And I'm so proud of what we've done with those companies and the others. You're right. I did mention that every advertiser should have an identity strategy and that strategy can't just be cross your fingers and hope that cookies never go away, and for publishers, they need to have an identity strategy and an authentication strategy. And what I mean by that is when it comes to authentication, if you're not in CTV or audio where 100% of your users log-in, and that's not true of all CTV players, but that's true of most of them, then you need to find a way to get them logged in and to address consent, in other words, ask them, if you can provide them with personal content and create a quid pro quo that makes it worth it. Everybody needs to be developing that strategy, especially if you're in browser right now. So they've been given a bit more time, but they need to use that time to act. And even if Google does nothing more, you have to use that time to act simply because things like UID are so effective for CTV and audio and other channels and for those that have log-ins even in the browsing world that it will make it so that we prioritize that media over those that are just dependent on cookies or something else. So naturally, over time, it becomes very important. And this is more important for those in journalism than anywhere, just because they tend to move very slow and not be technological innovators, so it becomes really important that they respond to that. And advertisers, if you're not putting your data to work with an identity strategy, in other words, how can I use my data in a consumer-friendly way and privacy-centric way, how can I put my data to work so that I can do better marketing? If you're not thinking about that and honoring the sort of sacred relationship that you have with your customers, then you're doing it wrong, and you're likely to lose to those that are doing that. So there's a fair amount of pressure on both buy-side and sell-side to sort of get with the times. And all of this change is happening so fast, but all of that has created opportunity for us at an unprecedented pace, and that's part of the reason why we're so bullish. And when you add the deployment of what I think is our best product yet and certainly the product that I am most proud of our team for shipping in my whole career, not just at The Trade Desk. In Kokai, I just think we have such a bright future ahead. So thanks for the question and for the discussion today from all of you."

            "name": "Laura Schenkein",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong second quarter with revenue of $585 million, representing 26% year-over-year growth. During the quarter, we benefited from a relatively stable digital advertising environment supported by both agencies and brands. We continue to gain market share as more advertisers sought greater efficiency and measurable results, particularly in CTV and Retail Media. Our business model, with its wide range of large advertisers and vertical markets, also contributed to our success. Additionally, our growing access to premium inventory, including major events like the Olympics for the first time through NBCU as well as gaining access to platforms like Roku and Netflix also help ensure long-term durability and success, something we take great pride in. With the strong top line performance in Q2, we generated approximately $242 million in adjusted EBITDA or about 41% of revenue. When we outperform on the top line, we often see that outperformance throughout our financial statements as was the case again in Q2. I'm proud of our focused efforts to consistently generate meaningful positive EBITDA and free cash flow while continuing to invest in the critical areas of the business that will drive our future growth. From a scale channel perspective, CTV, by a wide margin, led our growth again during the quarter. In Q2, video, which includes CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter. Display continued to represent a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of our business in Q2 and international represented about 12%. We're pleased that international growth outpaced North America for the sixth quarter in a row. Across both EMEA and Asia Pacific, CTV continued to drive our growth. While still small relative to the share of CTV spend produced in North America, we see significant opportunities to capture share in these verticals. In terms of the verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, growth was broad-based again this quarter. We saw strong performance in the majority of our verticals, particularly in home and garden, food and drink and shopping. Family relationships and healthy living verticals were both below average. Overall, we continue to see healthy trends across our verticals and we continue to believe there is opportunity for us to gain share in the verticals we serve. Turning now to expenses. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses in Q2 were $363 million, up 19% year-over-year. While there are ample opportunities to achieve more leverage within our operating expenses, our primary objective remains on growing spend on our platform and gaining more share of the global advertising market. During the second quarter, we continued to invest in our team, our platform and our infrastructure to support sustained growth. Thanks to our careful management of operating expenses in recent years, we are well positioned to innovate our platform, invest in cutting-edge technologies like AI, expand our teams and further distance ourselves from competitors. Income tax expense was $27 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by our pretax profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income was $197 million or $0.39 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $81 million for Q2 and free cash flow was $57 million. DSOs exiting the quarter were 90 days, down about two days from a year ago. DPOs were 75 days, down about one day from a year ago. We exited the second quarter with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. In Q2, we did not repurchase any shares of our Class A common stock. We will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities. Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We continue to see strong spend in key areas, including CTV and Retail Media. We estimate Q3 revenue to be at least $618 million, which would represent growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $248 million in Q3. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter and throughout the first half of the year. The opportunity ahead of us has never been more promising. We are positioned within a large and expanding market, supported by a business model that consistently delivers robust top line growth, significant profitability and strong cash flow. With key growth drivers such as CTV, Retail Media, International expansion, a strong identity strategy and a major product upgrade with Kokai, we remain confident and optimistic about our future as we navigate the second half of this year and look forward to 2025 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.  \n I will now turn the conference over to your host, Chris Toth. You may begin. \nChris Toth: Thank you, operator. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to The Trade Desk First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Founder and CEO, Jeff Green; and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Schenkein.  \n A copy of our earnings press release can be found on our website at thetradedesk.com in the Investor Relations section.  \n Before we begin, I would like to remind you that except for historical information, some of the discussion and our responses in Q&A may contain forward-looking statements, which are dependent upon certain risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. Actual results may vary significantly, and we assume no obligations to update any of our forward-looking statements.  \n Should any of our beliefs or assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. I encourage you to refer to the risk factors referenced in our press release and included in our most recent SEC filings. In addition to reporting our GAAP financial results, we present supplemental non-GAAP financial data. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures, combined with our GAAP results, provides a more meaningful representation of the company's operational performance.  \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Founder and CEO, Jeff Green. Jeff? \nJeffrey  Green: Thanks, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. As you have seen from the press release, we are off to a very promising start once again this year. For the first quarter, revenue grew 28% compared with last year, marking strong revenue growth acceleration on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, outpacing the industry for a quarter or 2 is a great accomplishment, but I'm so proud of our team for now having outpaced the digital advertising industry for a couple of years straight.  \n I believe our revenue growth acceleration in the first quarter speaks to the innovation and value that we are delivering to our clients with Kokai. It also reflects growing awareness among the world's leading advertisers of the value and power of the best of the open Internet. To put a finer point on this, more than 90% of the Ad Age Top 200, the largest 200 advertisers in the world have run advertising campaigns on our platform over the last 12 months.  \n Even with this considerable size, CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel. Over the past few months, industry giants like Disney, NBCU, Walmart, Amazon and now Roku and LG Electronics have all made deeper pivots into CTV. Many of them in partnership with us, bringing more opportunity for advertisers. \n UID2 has become ubiquitous across the premium parts of the open Internet and along with greater first-party data deployment and advances in emerging data markets, especially retail data, we are building the new identity and authentication fabric of the Internet. In doing so, the open Internet is getting replumbed and revalued, especially in contrast to the value offered by walled gardens.  \n And the innovations in our Kokai platform will help our clients take advantage of this revaluation and fully leverage data-driven buying to fuel their own business growth. As a result, I've never been more optimistic about the future of the open Internet and our ability to gain more than our fair share of the nearly $1 trillion advertising TAM.  \n Let me dig into this a little deeper. I'd like to frame my remarks with just a little context on how our industry has advanced over the years, at least in part because of some of the significant and disruptive events today. I think this framing is important because I believe we may be in the midst of another period of major disruption right now. And perhaps most important, I believe our ability to anticipate and innovate in these moments positions us very well moving forward.  \n I've often said that the programmatic industry as we know it today, came to life as a result of the global financial crisis just over 15 years ago. At that time, there was tremendous pressure on all businesses to do more with less and to find new ways to differentiate, automate and grow more efficiently. With those pressures, the precision and value of programmatic became more immediately apparent to major brand advertisers and this proved to be a fertile environment for our business and so many others.  \n Similarly, the rapid rise of CTV as the driving force of programmatic would not have happened so quickly were it not for the COVID pandemic. With stay at home directives around the world, consumers shift en mass for the convenience of streaming, and the media world hasn't been the same since. TV has always been the central element of major brand advertising campaigns, so the shift from linear to CTV was always going to be disruptive.  \n What's perhaps more important is how quickly the TV industry has evolved as a result. CTV is now a driving force in how we think about things like authentication, identity, the use of retail data, relevance and attribution in advertising. And while it may not be as apparent as a global financial crisis or a global pandemic, I believe we're now in the middle of another great disruption in our industry. This disruption is very different because it is driven from major tectonic shifts within our own industry instead of from macroeconomic and pandemic forces.  \n Today's shift is largely driven from the conflict Apple and Google are having with governments and domino effects that are coming from new draconian policies and tactics coming from wounded big tech. For the last couple of years now, we've delivered consistent, durable revenue growth over 20%, significantly outpacing the broader market, including the major walled gardens. And it's because of the contrast between the best of the open Internet, what you might call the premium Internet and the content and characteristics of walled gardens has never been more apparent.  \n The details of the Texas Attorney General suit against Google and the approaching trial of the Department of Justice versus Google have shined a light on a few things inside of Google but has created a lot of clarity on things outside of Google as well. There is a wider understanding of a few immediate themes facing advertising. First, there is a broader understanding of the role that walled gardens are playing as major purveyors of low-grade made for advertising inventory.  \n Second, there is a much wider understanding of how bad ad to content ratios within walled gardens and the brand suitability risk of user-generated content, or UGC. This is in part due to the stark contrast that premium content has right now to UGC. The industry has growing awareness that consumers spend most of their quality time with premium content on the open Internet versus the walled gardens. Advertisers are making better use of their first-party data and retail data as they explore contemporary cross-channel alternatives to cookies.  \n And lastly, in advertising and marketing, like in many other sectors, there is a broad industry frenzy around AI and what it means for our industry. Taken together, I don't know that I've ever seen the industry in such a state of transition. In some corners of our industry, I also sense some panic and confusion about what to do next. But for us, this gives context to our recent outperformance as well as our conviction for why I'm so confident about the opportunity in front of us in 2024 and the years ahead.  \n One insight that reinforces the shift that is happening is founded where I'm spending my time. Over the last 6 months or so, I've been spending more and more of my time with CEOs, CMOs and heads of media companies, helping them make sense of the issues that I just outlined. And the bottom line across all of these discussions, there is consensus that the value is shifting to the open Internet.  \n But perhaps I should be more specific. It's shifting to the best of the open Internet, what we might call the premium Internet. It won't all happen overnight, but it is starting. In 2022, have marked the first year in a decade that the majority of digital ad spending took place outside of Meta and Google. With the proliferation of CTV and Retail Media, that trend accelerated last year, and I believe the trend will only continue moving forward.  \n The role of CTV and digital audio and all of this should not be understated. For many people, movie, TV and audio consumption is a very important part of their daily lives. It's premium quality content that captivate consumers who spend significant amounts of time engaging with it. No one watches Mandalorian or Curb Your Enthusiasm or March Madness casually. No one listens to their favorite podcast passively. I found in every aspect of my life, I can't talk to anyone about premium CTV content or the best of music without people sharing a passion for some form of those mediums. We are all highly invested in it.  \n That's very different than how consumers engage or talk about social media content, which is often short form UGC video, such as cat videos or 14-year-olds filming themselves falling off of bicycles. However, people spend much more time with premium content such as streaming TV and digital audio than they do with UGC. Our research shows consumers spend about 60% of their online time on the open Internet. The ad to content ratios are much better and therefore, the experience is much better.  \n But walled gardens still command the bulk of digital advertising spend because those tech giants have made it super easy to reach consumers at map scale, and the performance results are equally simplified. Hey, look, your ads did great. We told you so, so it must be true. But that's changing. Advertisers now have scaled alternatives on the open Internet. One of the major innovations in Kokai is the sellers and publishers 500 plus. This is a curated marketplace that represents the best of the open Internet, the premium Internet, where consumers spend the majority of their time online.  \n Its live sports events such as March Madness, where we saw a 200% increase in spend compared to a year ago. It's the latest movies and hot TV shows, it's music and podcasts on platforms like Spotify, it's trusted journalism. Now our advertisers can access that premium marketplace at scale easily and with confidence. In doing so, they don't have to see control of their valuable first-party data they get to measure effectively, and they can be sure that their ads are showing up against high quality content that's consistent with their brand. Advertisers now have a scaled way to control their own future.  \n Of course, our ability to buy the best of the open Internet is based on close working relationships with the world's leading publishers. Across the board, publishers are working with us to make advertiser access to their inventory as attractive as possible, which means making it as transparent and objective as possible. You only have to look at the list of expanded partnerships that we've signed over the last few weeks. We are integrating directly with the Disney Real-time Ad Exchange, which includes Hulu and Disney+ via our OpenPath technology. For the first time ever, NBCU will make the Olympics available programmatically to advertisers and is doing so with The Trade Desk.  \n LG Electronics has adopted UID2, VIZIO and Cox Media Group are connecting with us via OpenPath. TF1 and M6, 2 of the largest broadcasters in France, have integrated EUID as they make their content available programmatically. And just a week ago, Roku announced that it is expanding its demand strategy to include The Trade Desk for its premium content. \n Just to go one click deeper on Roku. I think it makes a ton of sense for Roku to embrace the open Internet with their premium content. Early on CTV inventory was scarce, it made sense for many of the premium CTV streamers to sell most of the inventory themselves. With the proliferation of CTV content over the last couple of years, those same companies now need to find ways to maximize advertiser demand and that means opening up to a broader range of demand sources such as The Trade Desk and embracing solutions such as UID2, which help advertisers find their target audience as accurately as possible. We are excited to be Roku's partner in this, and we believe this move is a win-win-win for Roku, for advertisers and for The Trade Desk. \n As a reminder, last year on 66, we started shipping Kokai. This platform launch is different for us because 66 last year marked just the beginning, and we've been shipping new features ever since. We are quickly approaching some of the biggest UX and product rollouts of Kokai that nearly all of our customers will begin to use and see benefits from over the next few quarters, including a game-changing AI-fueled forecasting tool.  \n Another major innovation that we're bringing to market with Kokai is a completely new approach to audience-based buying. We're able to do this because of the broad availability of new identifiers such as UID2, along with easier on-ramps for first-party data. This means advertisers can now take what they know about their most loyal customers and by new customers who look just like the loyal ones and find them anywhere across the open Internet.  \n Advertisers no longer have to use content as a proxy for audience. Instead of simply advertising against the NBA playoffs to reach pizza lovers, advertisers can find pizza lovers wherever they are across all digital channels. In Asia, Unilever and their agency, PHD, leverage our retail partnership in Kokai with Foodpanda to increase sales of their Knorr food sauces. Unilever was able to onboard its own first-party data on our platform then do look-alike modeling for Foodpanda's retail conversion and loyalty data to target new customers more precisely on the open Internet.  \n This new audience-based approach resulted in a 229% improvement in customers adding Knorr products to their shopping basket and an 81% improvement in customer conversion. \n Just like Unilever more and more advertisers are prioritizing ad opportunities where they can be sure they are reaching their target audience. And increasingly, that means activating their first-party data effectively and leveraging ad impressions where UID2 is present. This is the new identity fabric of the Internet taking shape, and it's revaluing the Internet and the process. Recently, Target Australia and their agency OMD worked with us to upload their first-party customer data into our platform, then targeted new customers using UID2. Their conversion rate improved 66% versus using traditional identifiers, and their cost per action decreased 36%.  \n And there are huge benefits to publishers who offer transparency and authenticated audience data to advertisers. Unwind Media is one of the world's leading gaming platforms. They recently reported that they saw a 47% improvement in the value of ad impressions when deterministic identifiers such as UID2 are present, and 107% improvement when users are authenticated with SSOs such as Open Path.  \n Let me also spend a moment on AI, not because we're trying to get on the bandwagon. We've been deploying AI in our platform since we launched Koa in 2016. Given the frenzy around AI, I think it's important to talk about how it is actually helping advance the work of programmatic advertising. Too much discussion on AI today is about AI and the abstract instead of practical details about implementation. We are starting to get better at explaining how our AI investments will actually help people do their jobs better.  \n To that end, we've known since before our company existed, that the complexity of assessing millions of ad opportunities every second, along with hundreds of variables for each impression is beyond the scope of any individual human. We have always thought about AI as a copilot for our hands-on keyboard traders. And with Kokai, we are bringing the power of AI to a broader range of key decision points than ever, whether it's in relevant scoring, forecasting, budget optimization, frequency management or upgraded measurement.  \n AI is also incorporated into a series of new indices that score relevance, which advertisers can use to better understand the relevance of different ad impressions in reaching their target audience. For example, UScellular worked with their agency, Harmelin Media, to leverage our TV quality index to better reach new customers. Their conversion rates improved 71%. They reached 66% more households by optimizing frequency management and their cost per acquisition decreased 24%.  \n I think it's important to understand how we're putting AI to work in Kokai because this kind of tech dislocation will bring new innovators. We see that now where major tech players are inviting scrutiny because they're behind the innovation curve on AI and more agile players, and I would include The Trade Desk in that bucket, are figuring out how to apply it to help humans make better, more data-driven decisions. We are also developing AI branded with Koa to make data-driven refinements on its own within the confines of human defined guardrails.  \n Let me close by trying to bring all of this together and help you understand why I believe this positions The Trade Desk so well going forward. I can't explain that any better than Jamie Power, the SVP of addressable sales at Disney, who spoke at our recent FORWARD '24 event in New York City. Disney is one of the pioneers of CTV technology, and Jamie talked about how UID2 is helping Disney offer advertiser match rates that are 3 to 4x higher than when UID2 is not present, and higher CPMs are clearly following higher match rates. That's a pretty astonishing statement about where the Internet is heading. Disney deals with an authenticated audience and they're leveraging UID2 so advertisers can find the right customers with much more precision in TV than ever before, against what many would consider some of the most premium content on the open Internet.  \n With the growing ubiquity of UID2, with new approaches to authentication, with better deployment of first-party data, with easier access to the premium Internet, and with major advances in AI, the ability for advertisers to reach the right audience at the right time and the right place and convert those customers has never been greater. And all of that's happening in our platform. And all of that happens with the advertiser in control of their data, understanding more precisely where their dollars are going, how they should optimize and how those ads are performing in service of their KPIs.  \n None of what I just ran through is really possible in a walled garden. I might not go as far as to say, we're seeing the early days of the fall of Rome, but the current macro and tech forces are creating an important moment of the reckoning for everyone in our industry, and advertisers are shifting more dollars to us as a result. Advertisers want a competitive market with price discovery because they want to own their own future. It is easier than ever for advertisers to understand who is delivering value at all points of the digital advertising supply chain. And they will increasingly gravitate to those who are helping them make the most of every advertising dollar with transparency and objectivity.  \n Of course, this is all made possible by our profitable business model which generates significant cash flow, which in turn allows us to invest in the major platform upgrades that characterize Kokai. \n So while I believe 2024 will be remembered as a year of great tech-driven disruption in our industry, I also believe it is a year that The Trade Desk will continue to differentiate itself from its competitors and continue to outpace the market. As the industry races to $1 trillion TAM, we are incredibly well positioned to take more than our fair share.  \n With that, I will hand it over to Laura, who will take you through more of the financial details. \nLaura Schenkein: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. The Trade Desk delivered another strong quarter as revenue was $491 million, a 28% increase year-over-year. Our growth is further evidence of the durable value that The Trade Desk brings our clients, and we continue to outperform the industry as a result.  \n All of our progress in areas such as CTV, Retail Media, Kokai and UID2 helped deliver another quarter of consistently strong growth and profitability to start 2024. In addition to strong top line performance, I'm proud of the $162 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter. representing a margin of 33%. Our strong growth in Q1 was broad-based in terms of geography and channel [ geography ].  \n Strength in CTV continued as the channel led our growth from a scale channel perspective once again. We also continue to see strong momentum in Retail Media as we continue to win shopper marketing budgets and as more of our existing clients utilize third-party retail data for targeting and measurement.  \n UID2 is being deployed by major advertisers and publishers at a larger scale than ever. And we continue to see the benefits from strengthening our relationships with major brands and their agencies.  \n From a scale channel perspective in Q1, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40% share of our business and continue to grow as a percent of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30% share spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%.  \n Geographically, North America represented about 88% of spend, and international represented about 12% of spend for the first quarter. We saw strong consistent year-over-year growth across all of our regions in Q1 with international growth outpacing North America for the fifth quarter in a row.  \n We continue to execute our growth playbook internationally, led by CTV and Retail Media. We remain optimistic that our business outside North America continues to be a strong contributor to our overall growth this year and for years to come.  \n In terms of verticals, every category greater than 1% of spend grew double digits in Q1. It's exciting to deliver such consistent growth across the business, and we're proud to see the value of the open Internet for premium Internet resonating with clients for many industries.  \n Turning now to expenses. Q1 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $352 million, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and platform operations as we position the organization for long-term growth. Income tax expense was $14 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation.  \n Adjusted net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $185 million and free cash flow was $176 million in Q1. DSOs exiting Q1 were 86 days, down 2 days from a year ago. DPOs were 70 days, down 2 days from a year ago.  \n We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Finally, in Q1, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $125 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities.  \n Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and Retail Media. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $575 million, which would represent growth of approximately 24% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $223 million in Q2.  \n In closing, we are encouraged about the momentum of our business. We're executing on large long-term growth drivers, including CTV, international expansion, Retail Media, our recent platform upgrade in Kokai, UID2 as well as the upcoming U.S. election cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow for our headcount efficiently and maintain a balance sheet that positions us to continue investing and achieving durable growth. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business in the remainder of 2024 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks.  \n And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. \nJustin Patterson: Great. Jeff, at the last Investor Day, you spoke about Connected TV forming a tidal wave. We're now starting to see Disney, Roku and even NBC with the Olympics leaning more on programmatic, suggesting that CTV won't be just a walled garden world here. It will actually be more open. So where do you think you are right now in just that tipping point from linear TV spend flowing into connected TV? And how are you thinking about the right investment level to seize that opportunity? \nJeffrey  Green: Thanks, Justin. I appreciate the question. So first, I think it's just important to take a step back and just look at where we've come from. It's been a few years. It wasn't that long ago that people were saying, oh, cable has got a long life. It's not going to be that long, and then the pandemic accelerated everything. Then we started talking about a new currency like UID2 and there was a fair amount of, well, are you sure you can get adoption on that? It seems like CTV has a lot of defenses or ways that it's going to be reluctant to adopt something new.  \n When you look at it now, and every streaming service has an AVOD offering, except for Apple. We've been saying for almost 10 years that Netflix would be showing ads and of course, they are today. In the last months, we've talked about how Disney+, the Olympics are coming to NBC, but they're also coming to programmatic for the first time, and they're doing that via The Trade Desk. And then, of course, our Roku partnership, and I think even during the height of the pandemic. People would not have predicted that we would be in the place that we are.  \n Those 3 big announcements, our Disney+ announcement being to integrate directly with them have all come in roughly the last month. And then, of course, UID2 is the primary currency of connected television. And so with that backdrop, I think we're in a phenomenal position. And once again, the consumer is leading in the sense that as they move away from traditional television, cable and linear television, they're moving in to streaming and connected TV and all of those are filled with ad options.  \n So the content owners and the streaming wars are more dependent on programmatic than ever. As we're seeing things like profitability, and Hulu and Disney excel in large part because of them leaning into programmatic, and we're super proud of our partnership there and across the board. As I said last quarter, I believe there will be an increase in inventory this year. I think we've heard that theme from most of the content owners throughout the year.  \n And the scale of identity is going to continue to go up, and that's in part because of that inventory going up. And I think all of that tips the scales even more towards the buyer's market. There is going to be more supply, and it makes it so that buyers can be more selective in what they buy. That makes it more important for everything to be layered with UID2, but also makes it more important for them to be very deliberate about what they're buying. And most of the streamers have to rely on programmatic so that they don't add to the ad load and, therefore, shrink or slow their growth.  \n So I think that puts us in a tremendous place to thrive, and we're seeing more and more pressure on anybody who tries to create a walled garden like strategy in CTV. And so I think you're going to see more and more of the open Internet led by connected television. And I think this year, so far, even just the headlines from this year so far are underlining that point. \nOperator: The next question comes from Shyam Patil with SIG. \nShyam Patil: Congrats on another really strong quarter and outlook. I had a 2-part question. Jeff, I guess, following up on the first question, how do you think about the impact of Amazon's ad-supported Prime video offering from a competitive perspective? And then for the second part, this is related. Disney called out in their earnings call that there's a lot more supply in the market as a result of the competitor entering the ad-supported tier. And I think everyone's assuming that that's Amazon. And there are just some concerns out there that a massive influx of CTV inventory at lower CPMs, good depressed the CTV market overall without necessarily driving more demand. So I'm just curious kind of your thoughts on how all of this affects you guys and the industry. \nJeffrey  Green: You bet. So can you remind me of the first part of your question? So how does the increase in supply -- I get on the second part. Remind me of the first part of your question? \nShyam Patil: Yes. Yes, I know it's a long one. Yes, the first part was just how you're thinking about the impact of Amazon's ad-supported prime video offering from a competitive perspective. \nJeffrey  Green: Yes. So today, we don't buy Amazon Prime video. That's only available from Amazon selling it themselves. And as you point out, I believe they're adding a significant amount of supply but then only selling it themselves, which does put some pressure on the objectivity problem that their DSP in particular has. And when I say the objectivity problem, I mean, it is very difficult to go to a buyer and say, give me your money, and I will help you objectively figure out where to put it. And by the way, I own a lot of it. And so I would, of course, bias towards selling my own. \n Everybody who does that tends to have a problem when they're repping other people's inventory, it makes it difficult for them to partner with. But their objectivity problem that I just described is it could also would be similar to a Google or somebody else. But they take it even one step further, which is that at Google, they don't make products that compete with all of these people that are selling. And because they white label soap and baby wipes and diapers and whatever else at Amazon, that also competes with many of the CPGs who are doing all the advertising. And so it makes it even more difficult. \n So when you have more supply than you have demand and you have an objectivity problem, I think it puts a fair amount of pressure on them. What I do think is likely to happen over time, though, and we're seeing this happen inside of Amazon is them creating more separation between their different entities. I don't think it's good for Amazon or Amazon users for the ad experience to be inferior simply because they own the DSP. And what I anticipate will happen over time is that they will make their inventory available to everyone. That's what I would love to see. \n I'd love to have access to the inventory, and I would love for them to adopt UID2 and tell them I believe they're operating an anemic market. I think they are going to struggle because UID2 has become a ubiquitous currency for everyone in the CTV space, because advertisers want to bring their own data to the table and they want to buy very deliberately and make certain that it's going to work. And with the objectivity problem I just described, they are going to struggle to get the high CPMs and the data-driven high CPMs that could come if they were operating a more objective ecosystem. \n So I'd love to see them evolve, actually, not too dissimilarly from what we've seen from Roku. To see them evolve to a place where they embrace the open Internet, embrace those common currencies so that advertisers can bring their own data to bear, and then they would get higher CPMs. They could have a lighter ad load. They could have a better ad experience and all of that would be good for Prime video customers. But there's a lot that has to happen. \n Until that happens, I actually don't think they're that competitive. And I think all the other players have a much more competitive offering to the most premium advertisers, which is what television is really all about. So -- and tell them, I think the premium supply doesn't have quite as much of a surplus as there could be if Amazon embrace that, and I think we're going to see it take a little while before we get there. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. \nBrian Fitzgerald: Jeff, it looks like third-party cookies won't be going away now for at least until '25. What are your thoughts on the cookie deprecation delay once again? And how, if at all, it impacts the industry? And then maybe secondarily, could the continued delays have any impacts, positive or negative, on UID 2.0 adoption? \nJeffrey  Green: Great. And so first, I'm glad to get this question on cookie deprecation not because I haven't heard it before but in an effort to hopefully put it to bed for at least a little while until the next headline hit. I've been blown away by how much in trade press, there has been discussion about cookies. And maybe it's because I felt like it was a very important topic to talk about 2 or 3 years ago, but I just feel like we already had all these conversations. \n So I was on record, I remember during the pandemic of saying, I think it is a strategic mistake for Google to deprecate cookies. I don't think the risk/reward is worth it for them. And I would not be surprised to see them delay this again and again as they continue to buy more time. I think that's exactly what we saw because we weren't surprised by this. We predicted this. We have just been sort of quick to move on. \n I do want to give Google a little bit of credit, though. I mean Apple took away cookies and said nothing, gave no announcement, offered no alternatives. Google said we're going to take away cookies, they gave some head start. Now they moved the data a bunch both forward and backward, which to me didn't make any sense. But they did at least try to propose something else, which was a privacy sandbox. The unfortunate thing was what they proposed was half bake and not a [ great ] solution. \n And so the industry has just been criticizing, us included, for the better part of the year because those criticisms, I think, were pretty unanimous even from industry bodies like the IAB that I've never expected to take such a strong position on privacy sandbox. I think it forced Google's hand to delay cookie deprecation. \n So we were not surprised by it. The net effect of that is that it gives the open Internet a bit more runway to adopt things like UID2, and come up with authentication and identity strategies so that they can drive an environment outside of cookies. \n I think this is very good for some of those that move slow. Some of the legacy media companies, especially those in journalism, I mean, journalism is being hit from so many side, especially in the big tech sort of pulling away from them which makes it harder and harder for them to monetize and they had a whole pile of problem before their CPMs went down. So I do think that this delay makes it so that things will function a little bit longer. \n But I don't think it actually slows down UID2 adoption. We haven't seen any of that. And the reason why I don't think it slows it down is because the world knows they're serious. The world knows that it's not going to last forever. They are looking for a way to get out of this. And so I think the average publisher is saying exactly what we were saying 4 or 5 years ago, that while we think it's a strategic mistake for Google to get rid of cookies, we also think it's a strategic mistake for all the rest of us to do nothing. \n And so everyone else, I think, has bought into that strategic fact that everyone has to be moving and operating and adjusting. So I do think that prevents any sort of dips or drop-offs where some 20% of slow adopters get meaningfully hurt. I think it helps give them a bit more runway. But I don't think it decelerates the adoption of UID2 in any way in part because UID2 adoption has been led by CTV, and CTV providers are competing with each other. \n And that is a way that they differentiate from one another is, do I make it easy for the biggest brands in the world to put their own data to work as they buy my media? And if I do that, I won't get higher CPMs. All of them need that at streamer X, Y and Z irrespective of what happens at the New York Times or the LA Times or anywhere else like that. So hopefully, that answers the question on cookie deprecation. I'm excited to be moving on from this. \nOperator: The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. \nVasily Karasyov: Jeff, I would like to ask you to talk about the deeper partnership with Roku that was announced last week. We heard some commentary from Roku. And from your perspective, what would you highlight for us that is significant for the Street to know? And in addition, as this progresses, I think the time line is a couple of quarters out. Can this lead to increased volume of CTV advertising for The Trade Desk? And if so, how would that mechanics work? \nJeffrey  Green: Thanks. So it's early days in the specifics of our partnership, but we're very excited about the long-standing relationship that we've had with Roku and seeing it finally materialize into something meaningful. And I do believe this is something meaningful. The Roku Channel has grown tremendously over the last couple of years. So as they become more and more into content, and that includes having more ads, we're excited to have access to those in large part because we view Roku as a key premium publisher in the connected television space. \n A couple of things that I think are incremental about the partnership. We anticipate their adoption of UID2, so we think that will be important. Our relationship has strengthened during the most recent discussions, and we believe that we will play the role as their most strategic demand partner. I think for the first time ever, advertisers can get access to Roku's ACR data directly in The Trade Desk platform. \n And perhaps as significantly as any of those things, I think us getting access to biddable inventory is a very big deal. Too much of CTV is still sold on a programmatic guarantee basis or a fixed rate basis and that is becoming increasingly undesirable. As more inventory comes online, buyers want the option to pick and choose. That is why they will pay a premium. That is the way to get a premium, and that requires a strong persistent sense of identity or identity currency. And that also means making the inventory biddable. \n So the strength of the partnership and the relationship is the best that it's ever been with Roku. I'm really excited about the change that this represents for them. And we're excited at the partnership and excited for what it means for the future. \nOperator: The next question comes from James Heaney with Jefferies. \nJames Heaney: Can you just talk more about the expanded OpenPath partnership with Disney's streaming properties? Curious how this impacts just the amount of CTV inventory that you're now able to access compared to what you had before? \nJeffrey  Green: You bet. So let me just take a step back to explain what OpenPath is. Over the years, the supply path in digital advertising has gotten more and more convoluted. And sometimes it's because of the tactics used in companies like Google, where the DoubleClick Ad Exchange was once a pure theme and then they introduced things like Open Bidding and Open Bidding is really the backdrop whereby they created a lot of funky options that are described in the Texas Attorney General's complaint. \n So I think there's been a whole bunch of things that have made the supply chain complicated, not least of which is Google, but also the incentives that, that has created for SSPs and the way that they process auctions. In an effort to make the supply chain more efficient, we created an offering called OpenPath which is essentially going to the largest publishers in the world, often in connected television, but in any channel where they want to plug in directly with us. \n So I want to be super clear, we are not in the yield management business. That is a function for publishers and their technological representatives. We are representing the buyers, but we're willing to give them visibility into our demand directly so that an intermediary can't make it more convoluted, more opaque and in some cases, charge more than they're adding in value. So we've connected OpenPath this pure pipe of visibility into our demand directly in to Disney's DRAX so that they have UID tied directly to them, and we have better visibility into the way that the auction works. \n We expect 100% visibility eventually at Disney. We're moving in that direction. We -- they said on stage at FORWARD '24, by the way, that 50% of the business is automated and addressable. And by 2027, they expect that to be 75%. So we're on the path toward to 100%, but that is all made possible by us plugging in directly and having a clear sense of where is UID present, where is it not, how can we make things more addressable and how do we make the connection between us or said another way, how do we make the supply path as clean, clear, transparent and efficient as possible. And by us plugging in directly with Disney, I think we're setting yet another model for the way that the most optimal integrations can be done in connected television. So very excited to be doing that with one of the biggest in the space. So thanks for the question. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. \nJason Helfstein: I want to ask a question about social video. It seems that it's been gaining share and as linear dollars are just kind of leaving linear, like it's definitely competing with CTV for a share of those dollars. Just any thoughts about how you think about that, how you can kind of utilize that channel for your customers? And then it also seems to be perhaps pushing CTV to embrace more data to try to be competitive with that. And so maybe comment on that, agree, disagree, et cetera. \nJeffrey  Green: You bet. So in the move from offline advertising, which, of course, pre-Internet was everything. And in the world of digital, everything has been shifting towards digitization and eventually we think all advertising will be transacted digitally even for the small minority of that, that has not actually executed digitally. So we'll use digital pipes even if we're going to run an ad in print, for instance. So everything is moving to digital. \n As it's been moving to digital, it's gone in -- there's been sort of 2 poles or 2 centers of gravity. One is around user-generated content that has exponentially more supply than demand. Orders of magnitude, more supply than demand because they're uploading thousands of hours every second or whatever, whether it's on TikTok or YouTube, the amount of content is off the charts. And what those platforms have often done really well is made it really easy for you to spend money and then they often report the results on their own, in other words, grading their own homework to tell you how they did. \n When you use those metrics and partly because of the supply/demand, the reach is really cheap. And when you contrast that to premium content, it can seem very cheap, especially when you're relying on the metrics that are provided by the companies that are selling you the inventory. We have focused all of our efforts on the premium side of the Internet. And more and more, you will hear us talk about our goal is to monetize the premium side of the Internet, in large part because that's where people spend all their time. \n We mentioned in the prepared remarks that the ad to content ratio in user-generated content is worse than it's ever been. We think that is going to continue to get worse even though the amount of inventory goes up. And as a result, you're seeing more and more advertisers sort of flee to safety. I want to be associated with premium content. And I want to be associated with ads that I know are getting visibility. And as they are getting to be more and more of those ads, it makes it easier for them to say I want to be associated with those where I know I'm getting the 30-second spot. I know I'm getting people's attention. I know they're not skipping it. I know they don't hate my ad in front of that 14-year-old falling off of something. \n So increasingly, you'll see us talk about the premium side of the Internet because we know that that's where the most premium advertisers in the world want to go. And there's more and more question about UGC as it becomes more and more the epicenter for hate speech and all the worst parts of the Internet. So I expect that separation to continue. It doesn't mean that there won't be budgets going there. But I think the majority of the growth is going to go to the premium side of the Internet because the premium side of the Internet is getting so much better at making those available in a data-driven way, which kind of gets to the second part of your question. \n You're exactly right, actually, that one advantage to sort of the social media video as you put it, is that the supply chain is one company end-to-end in large part. So they go get demand and then they execute it themselves. And so while the -- while we can criticize them for not having objectivity, we have to -- it's like [ crave and ] to some extent, for making it super easy and it's easier when your ecosystem is really just one company. \n Because now we're doing integrations like the one we just talked about with Disney, we're making the supply chain of the open Internet so much more effective that when you couple that with the most premium content, whether we're talking about in music or in journalism or especially in CTV, all of those things make the premium Internet more accessible to the most premium advertisers in the world. And as the amount of inventory goes up in that world, we also expect more of the dollars to do that -- to move in that direction. \n So I think all of this is good for us, but I just wanted to paint a picture of that contrast. There are those 2 centers of gravity they will continue to get spend. But the one that is growing most, I believe, is the premium side of the Internet. \nOperator: The next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham. \nLaura Martin: Jeff, I believe that great leadership creates great value, and I really appreciate your leadership at the open Internet. So I wanted to say that first. My question is on CTV full funnel. So it feels to me like with your deal with Walmart on RMN and then buying VIZIO and Amazon turning all of its 200 million Prime video [indiscernible] driven. It feels like the TAM expansion going on in CTV is bottom of funnel, which is making connected television an omni-funnel channel, not just top of funnel, which was sort of the historical thesis. My question is, is part of your growth, this 28% industry-leading growth you're reporting, because you actually have a full funnel option in connected television? \nJeffrey  Green: The short answer is yes. So it is true that the easiest dollars to move over are top of funnel because that is, of course, where the biggest advertisers in the world have historically spent. And so they are moving over budget, but previously they'd put in linear and those would come over to CTV. They're taking the same assets and in some cases, even the same way of thinking about it. Well, it improved the metrics a bit and then they improved the targeting a lot. And therein is the new sort of ported over TV budgets. \n However, as you point out, you don't have to spend that way very long to say, now what do we do next? How can we improve on that? And that's why we're bringing retail data to bear really is just showing amazing advantages for those that have historically sold in brick-and-mortar stores that have historically had difficulty getting data online but now they can partner with many of the biggest retailers in the world who are also trying to compete with big tech and in large part, they're trying to compete with the Amazons of the world. \n So all of them are saying, how can I put my data to work so that we can sell more product at a Walgreens or Dollar General or a Walmart or a Target or so many others, Albertson, so many others, Krogers, so many. But if they can sell more product in their stores by making their data available on our platform, then the advertiser is getting a bit more bottom of the funnel, the retailer is being able to provide proof that their data is actually selling more product in their own 4 walls, and that makes it easier for them holistically to spin their flywheel faster, which is exactly the way they think about it in places like Amazon. \n So it ends up being a win-win between the retailer as well as the advertiser as they get data and insights and efficiencies that they haven't had before. And that is, by its very nature, a bit more bottom of the funnel. I think we've merely scratched the surface on what's possible there. I think there's so much ahead for that. Not dissimilar from what we were just talking about in supply chains. There's a lot of work we need to do to unlock that data to make it easier. \n There's way too many manual processes today. We -- I had a meeting with a very large data company today about just making certain that the pipes are very connected so that we can make it easier for the biggest advertisers in the world to use their own data to keep it safe, to do only things that they would want to do with it that are respecting the very sacred relationship that they have with consumers so that they can leverage that data top and bottom of the funnel to be more efficient and the amount of unlocked and things that are possible in large part started by retail media are just things that we haven't even imagined even just a couple of years ago. So it's a really exciting time. \nOperator: Next question comes from Mark Zgutowicz with the Benchmark Company. \nMark Zgutowicz: Just maybe a follow-up to Jason's question on social walled gardens. If you look at your mix across all of your ad categories, it's been relatively unchanged since December of '22. This quarter, you indicated mobile dropped from a high 30% to mid-30s, but we haven't seen video move up from the mid-40s since December '22. So I'm just curious what's sort of driving that dynamic would have, I guess, expect to see video mix moving higher as all these CTV initiatives are implied? \nJeffrey  Green: Honestly, I don't spend that much time on measuring the mix. Of course, I'm very interested in seeing CTV continue to grow, and I am interested in the overall growth rate. But because when you're looking at the growth rates against each other, when one is doing really well, it doesn't necessarily mean the other is doing badly, even though the slice of the pie goes down. Because the pie is getting bigger, we're excited about that growth across the board. So whether it's high 30s to mid-30s in mobile and whatnot, we're still heading in an amazing direction of growth. \n And honestly, we spend a lot of time trying to actually properly categorize inside of things like video and sometimes small moves like people watching video on phones or offline versus watching them on CTV have an effect on what we described as growth in CTV versus video or otherwise. When the content is almost the same, it's just a device. \n And so creating distinction between premium content and devices can sometimes muddy the waters and the numbers, which is not ever what we intend to do. We're simply just trying to show the value of premium content. We know that, that trend overall is very good, irrespective of what devices they're used on. And in fact, even if you look at it on a device basis, the trends are also very good. So the small changes that you're describing, I honestly don't spend that much time thinking about it. \nLaura Schenkein: Yes. And Mark, this is Laura. I would just add that video does continue to increase. We just don't break out the exact percentages. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. \nMark Stephen Mahaney: [indiscernible] from analogy. There's been rising regulatory scrutiny of Google, I think, and I know and I met it for a couple of years, but it's really kind of come home this year. You mentioned some of the stuff that's been disclosed, you've got 2 trials that will probably have decisions between now and the end of the year. So was that actually causing a notable material acceleration or shift of ad budgets away from Google towards The Trade Desk? Have you actually seen that now that the -- whatever the right now, the chickens have come home to roost? \nJeffrey  Green: Yes. Thanks, Mark. I really appreciate the question. So when you get an incremental dollar, it's sometimes hard to figure out why you got it or where it came from. But -- so it's hard for us to attribute how much of that is coming from people's fear of Google. I mean I know that we win money from Google CFP all the time. Sometimes, we think that's because our product is better. Sometimes, I think it's because our objectivity is better. Sometimes, it's because we're not going to spend most of your money on YouTube. \n There's a whole bunch of reasons why that's the case and regulatory scrutiny is one of those. But I will speak to the sentiment, which I think is just easier to speak to. As I have more and more conversations with C-suites at some of the biggest companies in the world and talk about it in the context of either partnership or seeking their advertising dollars. The acknowledgment that handing over your data and your money to Google and hoping for the best and especially when that is a critical part of your future is increasingly viewed as a risky strategy that people have to take their own faith in their own hands. \n And that's one of the things that I think is so compelling about our offering right now, is that we are not saying trust us instead of them, and we will do the same thing they do just with more focus because we don't own YouTube. That's not what we do. We actually tell them we will give you the details of all of your performance. It's your data, you take it with you, you own it. And that way, you learn and you always own your future. That part where advertisers want to own their own future. \n It feels like that is more important to them than it ever has been, and I do believe that the regulatory scrutiny and all the -- there are a lot of people that have read the Texas Attorney General's complaint and have thought about the effect that, that has on the ecosystem, and it does make them want to be more deliberate about where they spend, and it does make them, in many cases, I think, a better partner for us, and it helps us to see what kind of partner we want to be to them. But I do believe it is contributing to our growth, but it's really hard to quantify is the short answer. \nChris Toth: And then one last question, John. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. \nMatthew Swanson: Yes. Great. Jeff, I feel like we've spent a lot of time on the call kind of thinking through CTV publishers and why strategically it makes sense for them to open up more. But I guess, thinking of it from the advertiser side, as CTV continues to scale and just the complexity of buying gets larger, how important is it for them to get back to a single pane of glass? And you've used this term currency a bunch in terms of beta consistency and kind of how can that drive more programmatic versus direct as maybe advertisers start to pressure those publishers? \nJeffrey  Green: When you say a single pane of glass, can you elaborate? What -- did you mean just spending on CTV? \nMatthew Swanson: Yes. So in CTV, as opposed to the idea of when your budgets are small, direct might seem more feasible? And as CTV budgets grow and the complexity grows and the number of suppliers grow, how much more important it is to them to start to create more automated processes. \nJeffrey  Green: I see. I love this question. Thank you. So when you -- it wasn't that long ago that as consumers, we were just using 1 or 2 apps on a Roku, where at least 5, 6, 7, maybe 10 years ago, I just used the Amazon and Netflix. And now there's a lot more options and almost all of them have ads. It wasn't that long ago that it was 1 or 2, and then it was only a few others, and then most of them had limited ads. And now there's a lot more and they all have ads. So if you're an advertiser, you can't just go to one company and say, I want to buy some ads and then have an understanding of the way of frequency caps in particular, will be used. \n You have to be thinking across all of these apps and you have to think about how many times am I showing the same user this ad irrespective of what show or what profile or what app they're using to watch it on. And so as the number of options goes up, and the amount of ad inventory goes up, the need to automate and be data-driven and have a persistent sense of anonymized identity is greater than it's ever been before. And that's partly because the ad prices haven't gone down. And in fact, for the premium stuff, for the things they really want, they've gone up. And that's not necessarily any longer because of scarcity. \n The scarcity has actually gone away. The amount of inventory has gone up, but there is scarcity when it relates to having all the meta data that you want in order to make an informed decision. And there will, to some extent, always be scarcity around the exact audience that people want to reach. And so by making that more available, that's how you get the premium. And so all of the streamers have figured this out. This is the way to get the premium. And I think they're all on a path that to me makes sense, like all of them are doing the right things. \n And that is one of the things that we have said about CTV really from the beginning is that it's perfectly fragmented. It is fragmented enough that no one could be draconian and create a walled garden. People doubted us when we said that initially, and I think that's proven to be true. But it also is consolidated enough is that you have very smart people running those, and they're going to be hyper rational. And as a result, we're seeing them all do, in my view, what is the right thing. \n Some of them are different parts of the sort of adoption or innovation curve. They're on different parts of the journey, in different places in the journey but they're all on the right path. So I'm very excited about the state of CTV. I really do think it has huge implications on the entire open Internet. I do think it's leading the open Internet as it relates to the premium content. And I'm optimistic that digital audio is right behind it. There are lots of leaders in digital audio that are doing more than what CTV has done, but there's still a lot of catching up to do as well. \n And I'm super optimistic about what that means for things like journalism as they're really starting to think about it the right way. But very optimistic about the open Internet led by CTV. Really appreciate the question. \nChris Toth: Thanks so much, Matt. You can close out the call now, John. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Laura Schenkein",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. The Trade Desk delivered another strong quarter as revenue was $491 million, a 28% increase year-over-year. Our growth is further evidence of the durable value that The Trade Desk brings our clients, and we continue to outperform the industry as a result.  \n All of our progress in areas such as CTV, Retail Media, Kokai and UID2 helped deliver another quarter of consistently strong growth and profitability to start 2024. In addition to strong top line performance, I'm proud of the $162 million of adjusted EBITDA we generated during the quarter. representing a margin of 33%. Our strong growth in Q1 was broad-based in terms of geography and channel [ geography ].  \n Strength in CTV continued as the channel led our growth from a scale channel perspective once again. We also continue to see strong momentum in Retail Media as we continue to win shopper marketing budgets and as more of our existing clients utilize third-party retail data for targeting and measurement.  \n UID2 is being deployed by major advertisers and publishers at a larger scale than ever. And we continue to see the benefits from strengthening our relationships with major brands and their agencies.  \n From a scale channel perspective in Q1, video, which includes CTV represented a mid-40% share of our business and continue to grow as a percent of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30% share spend during the quarter. Display represented a low double-digit percent share of our business and audio represented around 5%.  \n Geographically, North America represented about 88% of spend, and international represented about 12% of spend for the first quarter. We saw strong consistent year-over-year growth across all of our regions in Q1 with international growth outpacing North America for the fifth quarter in a row.  \n We continue to execute our growth playbook internationally, led by CTV and Retail Media. We remain optimistic that our business outside North America continues to be a strong contributor to our overall growth this year and for years to come.  \n In terms of verticals, every category greater than 1% of spend grew double digits in Q1. It's exciting to deliver such consistent growth across the business, and we're proud to see the value of the open Internet for premium Internet resonating with clients for many industries.  \n Turning now to expenses. Q1 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $352 million, up 20% year-over-year. We continue to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and platform operations as we position the organization for long-term growth. Income tax expense was $14 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and nondeductible stock-based compensation.  \n Adjusted net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $185 million and free cash flow was $176 million in Q1. DSOs exiting Q1 were 86 days, down 2 days from a year ago. DPOs were 70 days, down 2 days from a year ago.  \n We exited Q1 with a strong cash and liquidity position. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Finally, in Q1, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $125 million. The company will continue to approach the repurchase program opportunistically depending on market conditions and capital priorities.  \n Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We continue to see strong spend in our key areas such as CTV and Retail Media. We estimate Q2 revenue to be at least $575 million, which would represent growth of approximately 24% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $223 million in Q2.  \n In closing, we are encouraged about the momentum of our business. We're executing on large long-term growth drivers, including CTV, international expansion, Retail Media, our recent platform upgrade in Kokai, UID2 as well as the upcoming U.S. election cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow for our headcount efficiently and maintain a balance sheet that positions us to continue investing and achieving durable growth. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business in the remainder of 2024 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks.  \n And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Yes. And Mark, this is Laura. I would just add that video does continue to increase. We just don't break out the exact percentages."
