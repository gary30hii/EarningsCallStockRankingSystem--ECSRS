At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 19, 2020 [Sic] [2021]. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties. Please go ahead.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter 2020 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, project, or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information available on the VICI Properties website. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, Samantha, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. If for any reason you hang up or the line goes dead in the next 30 seconds, here's the one message I want you to take away from this call. In 2020, according to FactSet consensus, two-thirds or 14 of 21 U.S. triple-net REITs are projected to post year-over-year declines in AFFO per share. In 2020, as David Kieske will elaborate on in a moment, VICI's AFFO per share grew 10.8% for the year as a whole, and grew 24.3% in the fourth quarter. In a year 2020, when again, two out of three peers are likely to see declines in the AFFO, we think VICI's growth is worth remarking on. But it's been interesting to see commentary so far, which can be pretty much reduced to VICI achieves consensus AFFO per share. Did VICI achieve consensus is of course a key question. But we think it's also worth asking did consensus call for AFFO per share growing, staying steady or declining? Is it call for growth? Was it a lot of growth or a little of growth? Once all triple-net - American triple-net REITs report their 2020 results, we know with finality where VICI's AFFO per share grow stands on a relative basis. We already know where it stands on an absolute basis, and it is growth we're very proud of, especially coming out of the year so tough and so thoroughly dominated by the COVID-19 crisis. As I said in our Q3 2020 earnings call, what the COVID-19 crisis has taught us across the U.S. REIT management spectrum, is that the strength of the REITs business model is the aggregated strength of the REITs tenants business model. And for gaming REITs generally, and VICI specifically, the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated that our gaming tenants have built business models of great strength and durability, and the strength and durability of their business models is derived from the strength and durability of their relationship with their customers, the end users of our real estate. This strength of the gaming operator, gaining customer relationship is a key lesson I take from 2020. This strength of relationship and the mission criticality of our real estate to that relationship is the key reason we, VICI, collected 100% of our rent in 2020 on time and 100% in cash. It\u2019s the key reason we were able to announce what we believe is one of the larger 2020 dividend increases among large cap American REITs. It's a reason we were able to go back on offense as early as June with our Caesars Forum financing, and later in the summer, our first non-gaming financing with Chelsea Piers. Finally, it\u2019s the driving force behind our AFFO growth in 2020 and our AFFO growth trajectory coming into 2021. But there's a second lesson I take from 2020, and it's a lesson, the clarity and power of which truly burst through in the second-half of 2020. And that is the emerging power of sports betting within the American gaming ecosystem. As gaming real estate owners, we aren't as focused on the TAM of sports betting revenue. So, of course, we hope our tenants realize as much revenue and profit as they can from this new channel of business, whether online or in property. As real estate owners of assets that we will own and our tenants will occupy for decades to come, we believe sports betting will have the greatest long-term impact and create the greatest long-term value by greatly expanding the audience for American gaming. American gaming is an American consumer discretionary sector. Every American consumer discretionary sector competes with the attention, time and spending of the American consumer. If a given sector can achieve competitive advantage in gaining and sustaining the attention of a potential new customer or consumer, that sector will likely generate outsized growth and value in the years to come. For American gaming, as an American consumer discretionary sector, we strongly believe sports betting represents a new competitive advantage. What we believe sports betting does most powerfully is insert American gaming more broadly and deeply into the American conversation. Think about it. What are the two great mainstays of getting an American conversation going? Number one, weather; number two, sports. You\u2019ll see as the day ever comes when casinos offer betting on weather, but today is now here when sports betting is getting powerfully woven into the all-consuming American conversation about sports. Just to say two examples, involving two of our tenants, every time the Caesars sportsbook gets cited exclusively on ESPN, and every time Penn is able to deliver a sports betting message to REITs partner, Barstool, each of these great American gaming companies is reaching an audience of potential new customers, especially potential new and younger customers. The American gaming sports betting represents a new and technology-enabled paradigm for reaching, engaging and activating a new, bigger and younger audience. This technology-enabled paradigm is a new tailwind behind American gaming. And if you look at REIT asset class performance over the last few years, the winning asset classes in terms of superior total return that tends to be asset classes with technology-enabled tailwind. Cell towers, data centers, and e-commerce logistics are just three such examples. Conversely, the asset classes that have struggled tend to be those suffering from technology-related headwinds. We believe with high conviction that the gaming real estate asset class should, in the next few years, benefit from the technology-enabled tailwind. So all in all, 2020 was a year in which American gaming and American gaming real estate proved its defensive strength by enduring through one of the great crisis of our lifetime. And 2020 also showed, thanks to the growing strength of sports betting that American gaming arguably represents one of the most compelling offensive opportunities in the consumer discretionary sector in the coming years. The next sound you hear will be the sound of the American consumer roaring back. And as many of you have been writing about, after many months of consuming many things, American consumers will return to what has been their growing preference for the last two decades; the preference for consuming experiences over things. As some of you may have heard on the Sunstone Hotel Investors earnings call last week, our good friend and Sunstone CEO, John Arabia, cited transient bookings for the second-half of the year at their Maui property that are currently double-digit 13% above 2019 levels, and the outlook continues to improve on a weekly basis. We believe this is one of the many anecdotes around pent-up leisure demand that will benefit the consumer discretionary sector at large and the economy continues to reopen. I'll now turn the call over to our President and COO, John Payne, who will talk about what we have done and moreover, what we are doing to capitalize on the roaring comeback of the American consumer. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. 2020 was another busy year for VICI as our hard work continues to pay off. In 2020, our team completed nearly $4.6 billion of transaction activity, growing our annualized revenue by approximately $360 million, or 37%. Throughout the year, we worked closely with each of our tenants as the pandemic unfolded to provide short-term solutions on and as needed basis. As Ed stated, our cash rent collection track record of 100% to-date is a testament to the quality and strength of our business model and our collaborative approach with our tenants. As you are undoubtedly aware, the recovery of the gaming industry has demonstrated that despite the many challenges over the past year, the consumer has not found a replacement with a bricks and mortar casino experience. Our portfolio of industry leading assets and regional markets continues to demonstrate margin expansion, and in some cases profitability above 2019 levels. While our Las Vegas properties, led by Tom Reeg, Bret Yunker, Anthony Corrado and the entire team at Caesars Entertainment continue to outperform peers on the strip. As we start 2021, we have the experience and credibility to explore opportunities both within and beyond gaming. And we're very encouraged by the volume and quality of potential transactions we see ahead. It is important to remember that for VICI, underwriting and investing in different sectors is not and either or. We continue to develop relations with gaming operators. We look for ways to support existing tenants\u2019 growth, and we continue to spend time studying and meeting with operators in sectors beyond gaming, in order to be prepared to transact when the right opportunities come together. Our gaming investments will likely continue to dwarf our non-gaming investments, due to the sheer financial magnitude generated by gaming assets. However, we believe that growing our portfolio accretively through sector and geographic diversification, while maintaining prudent risk levels will yield the superior returns our shareholders deserve. We believe VICI is in great position to continue our industry leading growth. And we'll abide by the same principles that have driven our success to-date. We work hard with integrity to be the real estate partner of choice. We do fair deals, and we collaborate with our partners to create value for all parties. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and our guidance.\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I want to start with our balance sheet. And since emergence, we've maintained a relentless focus on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles, and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. 2020 put forth and VICI was able to navigate some very heavy weather, as we continue to transform our balance sheet, all while maintaining ample liquidity and never drawing on our revolver. Just to summarize, in June 2020, we raised $662 million of equity through a 29.9 million share forward sale agreement. We still have 26.9 million shares outstanding, representing approximately $547.9 million in remaining net proceeds as at year-end. In February 2020, we raised $200 million of net proceeds through our ATM program. And as we've discussed with many of you, we're on a mission of achieving an investment grade rating, and during 2020 we continue down this path. Last February, we closed on $2.5 billion of an unsecured notes offering comprised of a mix of five, seven and 10 year notes at a blended interest rate of 3.8%, continuing to stagger our maturity profile. $2 billion of these proceeds were used to fund the Eldorado transaction, and the remaining $500 million of these proceeds were used to retire the 8% secured second lien notes. During 2020, we significantly improved our composition in the weighted cost of debt. At emergence, we had 100% secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.49%, and a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years. As we sit here today, 69% of our debt is unsecured, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18% and a weighted average maturity of 6.1 years with no maturities until 2024. As of December 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately 5.8 times. This ratio is not reflective of our true run rate leverage as it does not include a full 12-months of income from the Eldorado transaction, meaning if you take into consideration of full 12-months of rent from that transaction, our leverage would be well within our stated range of maintaining a net leverage ratio between 5 and 5.5 times. And as of year-end, we currently had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity, providing ample flexibility for future accretive growth. Just to reiterate, 2020 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet, which are, to maintain a disciplined composition and laddering of debt, whereby in any one year, we strive to have less than 20% of our total debt coming due, safeguarding the company's balance sheet against future market volatility. We're going to opportunistically access the capital markets, to lock in funding certainty for all transactions and develop continued access in partnership from the equity and credit markets to finance accretive acquisitions. As I mentioned, our goal is to maintain a long-term target leverage ratio of between 5 and 5.5 times on a net debt to EBITDA basis, and ultimately migrate the balance sheet to that unsecured issuer and ultimately achieve an investment grade rating. Just turning to the income statement, total GAAP revenues in Q4 increased 57% over Q4 '19 to $373 million. For the full year 2020, total GAAP revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 37% over 2019. These increases, as John mentioned, was a result of adding approximately $360 million of annual revenues during the year from the closing of the Eldorado transaction, the Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage, the Chelsea Piers mortgage and the Jack Cleveland Thistledown acquisition and related loans. AFFO for the fourth quarter was $251.7 million or $0.46 per diluted share, bringing full year 2020 AFFO to $835.8 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. AFFO increased 28.7% year-over-year, while AFFO per diluted share increased approximately 10.8% over the prior year, which is due to the increased share count and resulting temporary dilution in the first half of 2020 from the June 2019 equity offering. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the significant increase in EBITDA, as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in high 90% range, when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $8.1 million for the quarter, which we believe represents a good quarterly run rate going forward, and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.2% for the quarter, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. As always, for additional transparency, we point you to our quarterly financial supplement for a detailed breakdown of our revenue and lease streams, which is located in the Investors section of our website, under the menu heading financials. We welcome any feedback on materials. Turning to guidance, we're initiating AFFO guidance for 2021 in both absolute dollars, as well as a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning in January 2020, we were required to implement the CECL accounting standard, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, going forward, our guidance will be focused on AFFO as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments, and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. AFFO guidance for the year ending December 31, 2021, is estimated to be between $1,010 million and $1,035 million or between $1.82 and $1.87 per diluted share, which at the midpoint represents a 12.5% year-over-year growth in our AFFO per diluted share. These per share estimates reflect the dilutive impact of the pending $26.9 million forward sale shares, assuming settlement of the forward agreement on June 17, 2021, the maturity date of the agreement. In addition, these estimates do not include the impacts of any pending or possible future acquisitions, dispositions, capital markets activities, or any impact in the incremental equity drawdown from these forward shares. During the fourth quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.33 per share, which represents an annualized dividend of $1.32 per share. Our AFFO payout ratio for the fourth quarter was approximately 72%, in line with our long range target of 75%. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question today comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Hightower: Hi. Good morning, guys. Ed, thanks for your enthusiastic comments to start the call. It's maybe a valuable reminder that we on our side sometimes exist within our sort of narrow analysts speak bubbles, so I appreciate the reminder there.\nEd Pitoniak: My pleasure, Rich. My pleasure.\nRich Hightower: No, in all seriousness. But maybe I'm going to ask one sort of narrow question and then maybe a bigger picture question. But just in terms of really quickly on the Danville ROFR. Maybe just help us understand to the extent you can explain it at this point, some of the turns around that? And then, maybe I'm misinterpreting something here. But if I look at the roll through and sort of recompense for giving up the security of the master lease at Southern Indiana, how do we sort of pair the value proposition on either side of that, if that's an appropriate way to think about it?\nEd Pitoniak: John, do you want to take that?\nJohn Payne: Rich, I'm not sure that that's the exact way I think about it. I think that ROFR just has an opportunity,, obviously as the operators need to decide at some point, if they ever want to monetize their real estate. We sure would like to have own real estate in a new market, which we think is going to do great well. We're very excited about the new tenant that we're going to have in Southern Indiana. I\u2019ve known that The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for almost 20 years now from my old job when I worked at Caesars, and we're excited to help them expand their portfolio for the first time outside of tribal land. So, again, we - as you've seen with other deals, Rich, when we negotiate, and we do try to add to our embedded growth pipeline. And that's how this came about. In Danville, we'll just have to see if the operator ultimately wants to sell real estate.\nRich Hightower: Okay, I appreciate the color, John. And then a little bit from a bigger picture question, but also related to Southern Indiana. I know that the original press release stated 2.2 times coverage in the first year post-closing, so that puts us somewhere into sort of the mid to late 2022 by the end of that sort of measurement period. But take us into sort of the underwriting and how you gain comfort with what stabilized cash flows on this, or really any other investments are going to be over the next year or two? And how does the tenant and the landlord gain comfort in those \u2013 in that sort of ramp up, maybe as compared to 2019? Or how do we should think about it? Thanks.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Rich, I'll go out this first and my colleagues can jump in. First, it starts with the relationship of understanding who your partner is. And as I just mentioned, I've been fortunate to have a relationship with the tribe and watch them grow their incredible business in North Carolina to record levels, as well as the regional business, Rich, as you know, has rebounded tremendously when there weren't many restrictions on the business. So the pandemic started in March and April, the casino shut down. But as they reopened in places like Southern Indiana, we've seen them open with the consumer returning to the business, as well as a margin or an operating model that's much more efficient than ever before. And I give great credit to our operators to do that. And so, as we went into this deal, we put all of those together, we talked to the tenant, we understand how they're going to operate business, and we develop the plan from there. But critical part is understanding how this business is going to rebound as the consumer comes back to it. We're very - again, I'll repeat, we're very excited to have them as our sixth tenant and running the Southern Indiana property.\nRich Hightower: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPM Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Paolone: Thanks, and good morning. Ed and John, you guys both talked about the importance of partnering with your tenants to drive growth. As you are thinking about non-gaming assets, is that equally important as you try to go down that path? Or do you think you may just have to bid on assets and other product types and try to get it going that way?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Tony, the way we are approaching non-gaming is that we really want to pioneer into categories where REITs may not necessarily have been heavily trafficking and bidding and buying. We really have no competitive advantage in heavily marketed, heavily bid categories. And so what we're working hard to do, as we did in the case of Chelsea Piers, is identify either categories or subcategories, where we believe there are operators who have uniquely powerful, enduring relationships with their customers, and are producing economics that can support - more than richly support an OpCo/PropCo structure. It obviously takes a bit more time. But we're very excited about what we are learning and who we are meeting and who we're getting to know and the opportunities they represent. And I think, Tony, as we talked about with you around the whole technology tailwind theme, there are also cultural tailwinds out there, and we think there are certain experiential sectors, especially at the higher end we're going to have tremendous cultural and demographic tailwind behind them for the next 10 to 20 years. And that's where we see our opportunity. It's really not in the commodity categories of triple-net.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, great. And then for David, on the balance sheet, I mean, given what unfolded in 2020, and the performance of the portfolio. Any sense as to just how much more attainable IG might be in the near-term?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Tony, it's something that we've discussed the depth with rating agencies. We met with the agency several times during 2020, both on our regular checkup, but also as the pandemic was unfolding. And for us, it's really around the term loan. The term loan is secured by all, but one of our assets. And so we do not have a typical unencumbered asset pool like most traditional REITs do. So we need to refinance out of that secured term loan into the unsecured debt markets. And as we move into 2021 and into 2022, it\u2019s - we will sequence that refinancing of that term loan potentially into 2023, part and parcel with what may come in the acquisition and the pipeline, what sort of funding we may need for additional acquisitions. So, it\u2019s a - there's a clear path. GLPI has paved it and has proven that it's achievable tenant concentration. In of itself is not a gating factor, but just simply for VICI's cap stack and that term loan again securing all of our assets is - secured by all of our assets is the gaining item.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just one last follow-up, on the other side of things. Just again, given the performance of the space through the pandemic, do you think that changes the discussion around yields on investments as we look ahead?\nEd Pitoniak: It should. If this category behaves the way, certainly so many other categories have Tony, that have undergone an institutionalization process. Yes, the prices should go higher. Our mission, we would work hard at every single day at VICI to make sure our cost of capital improves at a rate equal to or in excess of the velocity of cap rate compression. But it just stands to reason that these assets should attract higher prices as time goes on, as everyone recognizes that they came through really, a totally unforeseen magnitude of crisis. And making to better than just about any consumer discretionary sector out there as a real estate asset class, so yes, you have to think, especially as people truly start calling out from under the rock to COVID, that we should see what -- but frankly, I joined VICI four years ago, which is to take part in the next cap rate compression story in the American commercial real estate.\nAnthony Paolone: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Grambling: Good morning. I guess a couple of follow-ups on the last few questions. First, as you think about any potential acquisition opportunities within gaming, are there any markets that you feel are more or less attractive or easier to underwrite given your current exposure? And can you weigh in on how that resilience of cash flow from operators may be impacting seller expectations around price relative to perhaps where the broader cost of capital is moved?\nEd Pitoniak: John will take the first part and David can take second.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Absolutely. Good morning, Stephen. Look, there aren't any markets that we look at that we wouldn't study right now. We'd like the fact that we have a balanced portfolio. We've said that since we started the company, and I think we'll continue to have a balanced portfolio. We'd like to own assets in these regional markets, and we've talked about how resilient they've been and we've talked about how they change with operating model. But we're also big believers in Las Vegas ever since we started this company, not only assets on the strip, but also in downtown and local. So Stephen, we'll continue to turn over every rock and look at opportunities and all of the gaming market. That doesn't mean that we'll invest in every market, but we are sure we will take the time to meet with operators and talk about how they're thinking about how we can help them grow. And I'll turn it over to David to take the second part.\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Stephen, correct me if I'm wrong, I mix with pricing and kind of always think about capitalization. The pricing is maintained. The regional markets have come back. There is the level set, obviously not a lot of transactions, but the pricing in the regional markets is that or near where it was pre-COVID. TBD and Las Vegas, given a little bit slower ramp there. But as we think about our capital and our leverage, we're very focused on maintaining our leverage between that 5 and 5.5 times that we've talked about, that's back to Tony's question, something that's important for the agencies. And then a deal has to be accretive, where we talked with you all a lot about what we buy day one is what we live with for 35 years. So we have to ensure that we have the capital and underwriting is done on an on accretive basis to continue to grow our AFFO.\nStephen Grambling: That's helpful. And then a follow up on the comments around non-gaming, kind of non-heavily bid market opportunities. Should we interpret that any cap rates that you'd be pursuing in those markets could be equal or higher to those that you were pursuing in gaming? Or they're even a tolerance that as you look at some of these, because they are a huge asset classes that you could actually move down the top rate spectrum.\nEd Pitoniak: It could be. It could be all of the above, Stephen. The fact that they're not heavily bid could mean there are better bargains to be had. But it could also be exactly to your last point that that we can afford to pay and justify paying maybe a somewhat tighter cap rate, because of the nature of the asset, the risk profile of the asset, the barriers to entry, and what is very proven durability of the asset over the long-term. So, I hope this doesn't sound like sort of vague answer, but it will be so situation specific.\nStephen Grambling: Fair enough. That's helpful. I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Hey, guys. I wanted to start on your embedded growth profile or sorry, embedded growth pipeline. Any thoughts on timing there? Caesars has been talking about selling a strip asset. And I believe the Centaur call option could kick in starting next year. Thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. So, you talked about something we're very proud of that we've worked on three years is building this embedded pipeline, with the deals that we've announced, and though we will continue to talk to our partner in Caesars about what they are seeing ahead, and what they are feeling about the Las Vegas market. And do they still see LA as they did when the Eldorado team took over Caesars but they may have one or two incremental assets that they don\u2019t feel like they need in their portfolio, and they would end up going through a sales process. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we're big believers in Las Vegas. We think that's the market that is going to rebound in all segments. And so they want to move forward with the sale. We're obviously very interested in owning more real estate of those assets that we have ROFRs. You also mentioned the put call of the two great Indiana assets in Indianapolis that come due, you're right on point, next year. And again, we'll continue to have talks with our partner about that. So two tremendous opportunities for us that we really worked on to develop over the years, with our embedded -- creating our embedded pipeline. As it pertains to timing, we'll just have to continue to have discussions with our partners on that.\nEd Pitoniak: Barry, if I could just add on something that kind of goes back to my opening remarks around VICI's growth in 2020. Someone could rightfully say, yes, okay, well, the markets already priced that growth in. And yet, what I don't think is being fully appreciated or valued in VICI is not only the growth we produced in 2020, and the growth trajectory that we bring in, in 2021. But the growth it is represented by that embedded growth pipeline, and just to get a little old school on you here, which I'm allowed to do because I'm really quite an old guy. I really encourage everybody to look at VICI on that old fashion, old school, price earnings growth ratio basis using our AFFO multiple in place of a PE multiple. And what you'll find especially looking over a multiyear period is that we will likely have in your calculations lowest peg ratios, you will find across the American REIT spectrum and certainly substantially below the peg of the S&P 500 at this current point in time. And again, I encourage a multiyear view because a lot of REITs are going to grow in 2021, because they shrank in 2020. And what you're getting with VICI a multiyear growth profile that goes into the future and just the way described Barry, thanks to the fact that in 2022, even if we couldn't get anything else done, we have got Centaur and the opportunity to call.\nBarry Jonas: Yes. And then just one follow up, recognizing it's been done so far in concert with your tenant. But do you foresee any more dispositions or prunings in the portfolio?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Barry, I will have to continue to study that, but not specifically at this time. But we'll have to continue to understand would there be an opportunity.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes to Smedes Rose with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you, you added a second native American tenant. And I just wondered, do you think this will be a trend to see more Native Americans moving away from tribal gaming into commercial gaming? And do you think you have maybe an advantage with two tenants in that wheelhouse already or sort of just touch on that a little bit?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it's a great question. It's exciting to see the tribes move into commercial gaming, because they've done so well in their original casinos. And so you're asking, will there be other tribes that will look at commercial gaming opportunity? I think there will be. And I think we do have relationships with numerous tribes, just based on my experience path, about 20 years\u2019 experience working at Caesars and working the Native American tribal developments. So, we'll continue to, to meet with them, understand what they like to diversify outside their nation. And if they do, look for opportunities where we can work together. And I hope that trend continues, because I think it's quite exciting for the nations that are doing this audits that we've got a relationship with the Seminoles in the Eastern Band of Cherokees.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, thank you. That's interesting. And then do you see, John, maybe are you seeing any sort of other entrants that have an incremental interest in their gaming industry now, given where cap rates are? And how, we will begin to expand on a relative basis? I know that sort of regulatory hurdles, but would you expect to see more foot players coming into the space?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it's a great question. There's no doubt that the resiliency of the gaming operators during the pandemic has caught people's eyes. When a lot of industries are -- some are still talking about cash or burns, and regional gaming companies are talking about record EBITDA, it's going to catch the attention of many people that invest in the hospitality or experiential space. So, your question is, will others come into the space, there's no doubt that others are looking at it, because of how well these assets have performed and the magnitude of cash flows. But as you know, the operating business is quite complex, and it had some licensing requirements. But I do think over time, you'll see more groups getting into the business because it's not only the bricks and mortar, but to the Ed's comments at the beginning how exciting the growth path is, when you tie in sports betting and potentially I-gaming.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys, thanks, John. I was wondering if maybe you could just address from a high level or almost a year, roughly into the pandemic era, and maybe go back to kind of prior to that and the nature of your discussions around deals. And I'm referring more towards terms whether it's coverage, things like that. And maybe just anything that's changed in the aftermath. Are people, potential sellers looking at different things? And I need that both from the Opco perspective, seller\u2019s perspective, your perspective. Is there anything that stands out as having maybe been tweaked a little bit given the circumstances of pandemic, as well as the higher margins that we're seeing now, as well as the ancillary business lines and whatnot? Is there anything that you've noticed that's been dramatically different?\nJohn Payne: Well, I'll start Carlo. I can't remember before the pandemic, what went on. I seem to have forgotten all of that. But no, look, I tried to have a constant dialogue, not only with our current tenants, but with all the operators in the gaming space. And I think as we think about underwriting, maybe we've talked more about rent coverage just due to what happened in the pandemic. But I think, Ed touched on this as well, it's just been exciting to watch the operators change their business model, or refine their business model so that when they come out of this pandemic, and I do believe we're going to come out of it, that they're operating these businesses just so much more efficiently than guys like I did 15-years ago. And that's exciting Carlo, and those are the type of conversations that we're having. As it pertains to transactions, I mean, we just continued to try to understand how the OpCos want to grow their business and is there an opportunity for our company to help them do that. And then obviously, there's a few levers of, if we do get into negotiations that you talked about, cap rate and coverage and escalation, all that. None of those have necessarily changed. So that's how I'd answer that question, Carlo. I don't know if Ed wants to add anything or David, but that's how I leave it.\nCarlo Santarelli: That's helpful, John. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of at Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Security. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Stender: Hi, thanks. Do I have it right, the Caesars Southern Indiana is not on tribal land? Is that the case?\nJohn Payne: Correct.\nTodd Stender: Okay. Now does Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, does they benefit from lower regulations, lower taxes? How do you actually underwrite that one? That seems pretty unique.\nJohn Payne: If you're asking about when they're the commercial operator Southern Indiana, they'll follow the same rules a commercial operator, whether it's Caesars or Penn, or any of them, the same rules will apply to them because the facility is not on tribal land.\nTodd Stender: I understood. Okay. So as a tribal operator, you don't get all those benefits, if you're off of tribal land?\nJohn Payne: They're very similar to the Seminoles in they are Hard Rock brand. I think you've probably followed that they have numerous casinos around the United States that they operate.\nTodd Stender: Understood. Okay. Thank you, John. And did you share any information on the land and plans around the Danville, Virginia Casino Resort?\nJohn Payne: Can you repeat? Did we share the what?\nTodd Stender: The proposed plans. There's the right of first refusal around the Danville property. Are there any\u2026\nJohn Payne: Yes, that's a development project that is just getting started. So there's information about Caesars and they won the license and their development plan is there, but it's just getting started.\nTodd Stender: Understood. Thank you.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Todd.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line at Daniel Adam with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Adam: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.\nEd Pitoniak: Our pleasure.\nDaniel Adam: So, you ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in total liquidity, including over $326 million in cash and $547 million that you have coming in from the forward share sell. You're in an envious position from a balance sheet perspective obviously. You're also arguably over capitalized right now. I guess, given your balance sheet strength, had you intend to deploy excess cash? And are there any near-term deals maybe in the next one to two quarters that are currently in the pipeline?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start there, Dan. I mean, Gabe and John can talk about the M&A landscape and outlook. But we have always historically I should say, we've kind of silly to use word always when the company is only about three years from its IPO as we are. But from the beginning, we have always tended to over equities the balance sheet in the interest of having firepower when opportunity strikes. And there may be a time -- there may have been a time some near-term dilution taken on, but that was near-term dilution endured for the sake of having a firepower to create long-term accretion to our ability to move very quickly when opportunity presents itself. We certainly do not intend to short change our shareholders, like keeping excess capital on the balance sheet for prolonged periods of time. But we're pretty confident, we're going to be able to put that capital to work.\nDaniel Adam: Okay, great. I don't know. I guess, John, nothing to follow up on.\nJohn Payne: No, I think Ed had talked about. Look, I'm spending my time, it's nice to be able to talk to the operators where, they're now focused on how to reopen and how to be safe. And they've done all that. Right now they can begin to talk about how do we grow and where do we want to go and how is the sports betting helping attract new customers and those things. And so it's nice to begin to have the growth conversations again.\nDaniel Adam: Okay great. And then -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Dan, I was just going to add, I think one of the emerging dynamics that is powerful and positive is the growing recognition of the value of network effect in American gaming. Harrah's and then Caesars, obviously were the pioneers of true network effect in American gaming, and would still widely be considered to be the leaders through the power of Caesars rewards. But I think increasingly operators are recognizing in part because of sports betting that there is genuine value in creating network effect, and being -- having stores in as many jurisdictions as you can. And that we think is going to be a powerful force, especially once COVID clears away and continuing to drive M&A, and with a lot of the M&A driven not so much by the sellers need to get out as the buyers intense desire to get it. And there are markets in which buyer demand can create incremental supply.\nDaniel Adam: That makes sense. I think you're alluding to market access, right, if I'm not mistaken.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. For our market access, also, and true market access being more valuable onto yourself and more valuable to your partners. Whether it be Barstool or William Hill, FanDuel, DraftKings, whoever your partner may be.\nDaniel Adam: Great. And then just turning to the non-gaming side. So last quarter, you alluded to the potential for follow on transactions with the Chelsea Piers. Do you have an update on the timing of any such follow on deals? And how might a transaction be structured? Thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: David, do you want to take that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Dan, good to talk to you. Look, as we've talked about with Chelsea Piers, it's opened the doors open their eyes open increase the dialogue around non-gaming in a descriptive way in the beginning, right non-commodity, high quality real estate. And with any deal, we can't talk about specific timing and whatnot. But we would continue to meet with, discuss with and have conversations with great operators that have great real estate that might fit in our portfolio. So, can't say exactly when the next deal will come. But we're optimistic that there will be some more non-gaming this year. But again, it's just to reiterate what John said, it's not an either or. We're very active on the acquisition front and as we've started the conversation working to deploy that capital that we have on our balance sheet.\nDaniel Adam: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John DeCree with Union Gaming. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn DeCree: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe one for Ed, and then a follow up for John. Ed in your prepared remarks, you talked a bit about the sports betting expansion and how that's such an exciting opportunity for the industry. I think a lot of folks can really see the clear picture of how that benefits your tenants and indirectly you guys, with higher rent coverage and higher revenue. But I'm curious if you have thought of or identified any ways that if VICI could benefit directly, and not referring to sharing in revenue or anything like that? But if there's an opportunity to fund themed sports books or look at your leases a little differently, given the earnings growth potential of your tenants and potential tenants. And just seeing if there's ways you can maybe find direct ways to benefit from this big industry trends.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. No, it's a very good question, John. And that would certainly be probably the most meaningful way, which would be a capital provider as great operators envision and execute what the whole sports betting sports culture sports viewing experience can be within a casino. John, I don't know if you've had a chance yet to go to Derek Stevens, new asset in downtown Las Vegas. But it is a great example. John has been there. John, our John Payne has been there. And John, maybe you can talk about it as an example of what we would certainly be happy with our tenants to fund, given the magnitude of vision that Derek has realized there. John Payne?\nJohn Payne: John, you might have been there. It's a really well done brand new facility in downtown Las Vegas that is centered around really a lot around sports betting and the uniqueness there and the type of customer that likes that type of facility. And so, anyway, it's just a great example of the trends that are going on right now in the first build from scratch casino during this what I'd say, sports betting trend or let's say since it's a really neat place.\nJohn DeCree: It is. It's a great place. I was thinking that. I was thinking Barstool teams sports books and those types of things. So it sounds like, let's say if a large tenant was going to refresh and rebrand, VICI could be a capital provider for that shareholders in exchange for some of it. Great. John, a question for you. You've experienced this through quite a few development cycles nationally. And it seems like we're on the horizon of one here in the U.S. And a lot of investors new to the space are always trying to calculate the PAM and number of assets. And we've got some developments, Nebraska, Virginia, Danville for you guys. New York talking about expanding casinos downstate. I mean, Texas is one that I probably would have never thought I'd be having that conversation again. But it's being talked about. So in your experience, kind of curious to get your thoughts realizing no crystal ball here. But are you seeing a push towards development? I know Red Rock, on their call called has a site in Las Vegas that's very interesting. So curious to get your thoughts on your outlook for gaming expansion in the U.S.?\nJohn Payne: Yes, John. It is an exciting time. I mean, again, I'm 25 years into this, and I can't think of a time that has so many different levers of growth for this industry. Most calls are talking about sports betting and iGaming. And you just brought up a whole another opportunity that is out there where there's the new development opportunities for operators to expand their network. And it is quite exciting, and whether Texas comes but there's already the states that you mentioned with its Virginia and Nebraska, potentially New York that are three big opportunities. So, it is an exciting time. It's obviously something that we talk to our tenants or future tenants about to see, is there a way to structure that makes sense for VICI and our triple-net model, and we'll just continue to study. John, the normalization of gaming throughout the United States, it's just amazing right now. And it's great to be in the space that we're in, and it's great to see the success of our operators.\nJohn DeCree: Thanks, John. And, David, appreciate the insights.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Massocca: Good morning.\nEd Pitoniak: Hey, John.\nJohn Massocca: So just one for me. Maybe touching on the opportunity in Central Indiana again, how do you think about timing of potentially pulling down that transaction? I'm just thinking about this given rent to EBITDA level is already predetermined in that transaction, and record EBITDA results out there and maybe some questions about how sustainable those are and how sustainable those margins are. Does it make sense to maybe wait a little and see if EBITDA normalizes and get at a rent level that's really appropriate for the property? Or is it kind of the time you had with the time to collecting rents and there's no real reason to wait if you like the properties per se?\nEd Pitoniak: John or David?\nJohn Payne: Well, the process is it -- right now just so we're clear, I mean, we own Southern Indiana right now. I think you know that.\nJohn Massocca: Central Indiana.\nJohn Payne: Central. David, you want to take that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. John it's a question that we -- the similar questions that we got a lot when we merged right, as people recall it. We had the three call properties that we could call it a tent gap, which ultimately folded into the other auto transaction that we announced in June of '19. But John touched on it. We've worked hard to build this embedded growth pipeline. So it's a combination of ensuring that we have consistent annual growth. It's working with Tom and Bret and Anthony and their team and what makes sense for their capital needs and their ultimate sale of those assets. And then you're right, the performance of the assets will be kind of a third factor and a third lever, but those call perhaps for that put call runs from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. So, at some point between that period of time, we're going to be thrilled down those that have a great cap rate which should be highly accretive. But there's a myriad of factors that go into it. And we're excited to have that embedded growth.\nJohn Massocca: I mean, is there any question about an individual asset level whether rents are maybe sustainable for the property. Or is there even, hey, Caesars and the tenant we trust. Obviously, we have a lot of other exposure to Caesars. I don't believe these are kind of corporate guaranteed, but at the end of the day that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. No, John, it's a good question. And one of the things we did get with the Eldorado transaction is that those would fold into the master lease. If you recall, we had a ROFR on those originally, and we converted that to a foot call. And those will fold into the master lease. So they will benefit from the corporate guarantee. And the asset level coverage is something that we will take into consideration, but knowing that they fold into the benefit of the master leases gives VICI embedded enhanced protection. And ultimately, part of the reason, Tom and team were willing to do the set up the put call is Tom's vision of bringing back and goal of achieving an investment grade rating on their side, right? This provides significant liquidity to pay down debt or continue their growth profile and improve the credit of our tenant, which will accrue through to VICI enhanced rent protections.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. Thanks a lot. Understood. That's it for me.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Katz: Hi, everyone. Thanks for working me in. I'll keep it short. I know there's an awful lot of focus on Las Vegas. And I'd love your perspective on how you're just generally speaking, underwriting Las Vegas? Meaning, operators are obviously projecting optimism. But from the investment perspective, are you anticipating revenues getting back to '19 levels in the next couple of years? Are you underwriting something less than that? Just how are you qualitatively thinking about that?\nEd Pitoniak: John can answer that in a moment, David, but I will just start by pointing out that this week we all learned of course, coke industries which has a rather strong record of capital allocation, it seems that they put capital in the Las Vegas, which I took as a net positive. But anyway, John, you want to answer David's question?\nJohn Payne: David, look, I touched on it earlier on the call that and I probably sound like a broken record in my three years in this job. I mean, we're big believers in Las Vegas, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. This is city that has multiple layers, levers of revenue. We think that the FIT customer is going to recover. We think the Vice business, they're going to be way ahead of many other U.S. destination cities. We think that plane supply will be added back to this market quicker than most destination markets, maybe faster than any market. And so, we're believers in this market, Dave, and the performance in Las Vegas has been people like to compare first 2019 and 2020. I think that's a little unfair. I like to compare the performance of Las Vegas versus other U.S. destination cities. And when you look at the performance of Las Vegas, in 2020, which is probably going to be one of their worst year ever. We'll compare it to New York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco, Orlando, I mean, this is the city that's very resilient, and the teams there are working very hard. The other thing, David, I'll say is that we've seen this margin expansion in the regional markets, because revenues have come back close to '19 levels. When Las Vegas fees revenues come back to that type of level, I think you're going to see similar margin expansion at many of these operators, because they've worked very hard to change the operating model. And so we'll have to see that because revenues are going to come back. So anyway, that's just a long way of saying we're believers in the market, the strip and we talked about circa in downtown and how downtown's changing. And then the results out of the local market of, what I've seen from Red Rock results and Voyage [ph] results that you have those business seem strong. So anyway, we like the market and we'll continue to see if there's opportunities for us.\nDavid Katz: Agreed. Thanks very much.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Hermann with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Hermann : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you walk us through the base case scenario for the upcoming Greektown variable rent adjustment? And as well get some color and a Margaritaville rent adjustment too? Thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: David or Danny?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, I can take that. Hey, it\u2019s David. So Margaritaville, and just put the 10 leases in perspective, right, there's a variable rent component, which is a small percentage of the overall rent that we get on an annual basis. From Margaritaville, it's $3 million as a $23.5 million of annual rent. And for Margaritaville, that we did not earn the escalator at that property, since the rent did not exceed the prior revenue metrics, or did not exceed the prior revenue metrics. And so, that was a variable rent decrease, and that was less than $100,000 decrease. So very, very de minimis on our total base rent. And then the Greektown that's coming up in June. And again, the variable component is $6.4 million out of the $55.5 million, $$55.6 million of total rent we collect, that $6.4 million of variable rent is only 50 basis points of our total revenue. So a small component of our total rent base again. And we'll have to see how that plays out given that's coming up in June.\nPeter Hermann: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Kornreich. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Kornreich: Hey. Thanks, guys. One of your peers this morning said they are recently seeing increased non-gaming opportunities come up. And I'm wondering if this is true for you as well. And if so, what's the reason for the recent pickup?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, it's an interesting way to phrase it. I mean, what we've been doing is going and looking or as I described earlier Jay, off market categories where we should typically not gone. So we are much more oriented to going and finding what we most want to invest in as opposed to waiting the market to present opportunities to us, because the market tends to present opportunities to it would be better that are by definition more mainstream and commoditized.\nJay Kornreich: Okay. Just wanted to throw on the neck. So thanks for that.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Could you guys just share your thoughts on the potential upside from New York expanding legislation around online sports betting? And then are there any other states that should be top of mind in terms of evolving regulation or legislation currently?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Well, Spenser, good to hear from you. We actually don't have any assets within New York State right now. But I wouldn't say about New York State is what I would say generally, in terms of how we're viewing sports betting, which is really as a key means of market or audience expansion. There will be a lot -- once New York figures out what it wants to do in sports betting, sports betting and the culture around it will enable it to truly widen its audience in a way so many other states and operators are doing. So again, we don't have any highly informed thoughts around New York, but very excited about what this means for gaming nationwide.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. And just one more, I believe we discussed this sometime last year, but any more thought given to structuring variable events based more on EBITDA, or income versus revenue currently?\nEd Pitoniak: Well, by REIT law or legislation, Spenser, rent variation has to be based on revenue. REITs are not allowed profit participation. So for that reason, we would expect to see all kinds of variable rent mechanisms continue to be revenue based. I think that's the right way to put it, David.\nDavid Kieske: Yes, that\u2019s right. Exactly.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks.\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, Spenser.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Amy. In closing, we thank you for your engaging with us this morning. As you can tell, we are very excited about our present situation, our near-term opportunities and our long-term prospects. We've been saying since we started in 2017, the gaming real estate represents the next great institutionalization story in American commercial real estate. Our conviction behind that thesis has only grown stronger, and we believe can be fully realized as we collectively witness the roaring back of the American consumer. Thanks again, everyone. Bye for now.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Presenters please remain on the line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thanks, Samantha, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. If for any reason you hang up or the line goes dead in the next 30 seconds, here's the one message I want you to take away from this call. In 2020, according to FactSet consensus, two-thirds or 14 of 21 U.S. triple-net REITs are projected to post year-over-year declines in AFFO per share. In 2020, as David Kieske will elaborate on in a moment, VICI's AFFO per share grew 10.8% for the year as a whole, and grew 24.3% in the fourth quarter. In a year 2020, when again, two out of three peers are likely to see declines in the AFFO, we think VICI's growth is worth remarking on. But it's been interesting to see commentary so far, which can be pretty much reduced to VICI achieves consensus AFFO per share. Did VICI achieve consensus is of course a key question. But we think it's also worth asking did consensus call for AFFO per share growing, staying steady or declining? Is it call for growth? Was it a lot of growth or a little of growth? Once all triple-net - American triple-net REITs report their 2020 results, we know with finality where VICI's AFFO per share grow stands on a relative basis. We already know where it stands on an absolute basis, and it is growth we're very proud of, especially coming out of the year so tough and so thoroughly dominated by the COVID-19 crisis. As I said in our Q3 2020 earnings call, what the COVID-19 crisis has taught us across the U.S. REIT management spectrum, is that the strength of the REITs business model is the aggregated strength of the REITs tenants business model. And for gaming REITs generally, and VICI specifically, the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated that our gaming tenants have built business models of great strength and durability, and the strength and durability of their business models is derived from the strength and durability of their relationship with their customers, the end users of our real estate. This strength of the gaming operator, gaining customer relationship is a key lesson I take from 2020. This strength of relationship and the mission criticality of our real estate to that relationship is the key reason we, VICI, collected 100% of our rent in 2020 on time and 100% in cash. It's the key reason we were able to announce what we believe is one of the larger 2020 dividend increases among large cap American REITs. It's a reason we were able to go back on offense as early as June with our Caesars Forum financing, and later in the summer, our first non-gaming financing with Chelsea Piers. Finally, it's the driving force behind our AFFO growth in 2020 and our AFFO growth trajectory coming into 2021. But there's a second lesson I take from 2020, and it's a lesson, the clarity and power of which truly burst through in the second-half of 2020. And that is the emerging power of sports betting within the American gaming ecosystem. As gaming real estate owners, we aren't as focused on the TAM of sports betting revenue. So, of course, we hope our tenants realize as much revenue and profit as they can from this new channel of business, whether online or in property. As real estate owners of assets that we will own and our tenants will occupy for decades to come, we believe sports betting will have the greatest long-term impact and create the greatest long-term value by greatly expanding the audience for American gaming. American gaming is an American consumer discretionary sector. Every American consumer discretionary sector competes with the attention, time and spending of the American consumer. If a given sector can achieve competitive advantage in gaining and sustaining the attention of a potential new customer or consumer, that sector will likely generate outsized growth and value in the years to come. For American gaming, as an American consumer discretionary sector, we strongly believe sports betting represents a new competitive advantage. What we believe sports betting does most powerfully is insert American gaming more broadly and deeply into the American conversation. Think about it. What are the two great mainstays of getting an American conversation going? Number one, weather; number two, sports. You'll see as the day ever comes when casinos offer betting on weather, but today is now here when sports betting is getting powerfully woven into the all-consuming American conversation about sports. Just to say two examples, involving two of our tenants, every time the Caesars sportsbook gets cited exclusively on ESPN, and every time Penn is able to deliver a sports betting message to REITs partner, Barstool, each of these great American gaming companies is reaching an audience of potential new customers, especially potential new and younger customers. The American gaming sports betting represents a new and technology-enabled paradigm for reaching, engaging and activating a new, bigger and younger audience. This technology-enabled paradigm is a new tailwind behind American gaming. And if you look at REIT asset class performance over the last few years, the winning asset classes in terms of superior total return that tends to be asset classes with technology-enabled tailwind. Cell towers, data centers, and e-commerce logistics are just three such examples. Conversely, the asset classes that have struggled tend to be those suffering from technology-related headwinds. We believe with high conviction that the gaming real estate asset class should, in the next few years, benefit from the technology-enabled tailwind. So all in all, 2020 was a year in which American gaming and American gaming real estate proved its defensive strength by enduring through one of the great crisis of our lifetime. And 2020 also showed, thanks to the growing strength of sports betting that American gaming arguably represents one of the most compelling offensive opportunities in the consumer discretionary sector in the coming years. The next sound you hear will be the sound of the American consumer roaring back. And as many of you have been writing about, after many months of consuming many things, American consumers will return to what has been their growing preference for the last two decades; the preference for consuming experiences over things. As some of you may have heard on the Sunstone Hotel Investors earnings call last week, our good friend and Sunstone CEO, John Arabia, cited transient bookings for the second-half of the year at their Maui property that are currently double-digit 13% above 2019 levels, and the outlook continues to improve on a weekly basis. We believe this is one of the many anecdotes around pent-up leisure demand that will benefit the consumer discretionary sector at large and the economy continues to reopen. I'll now turn the call over to our President and COO, John Payne, who will talk about what we have done and moreover, what we are doing to capitalize on the roaring comeback of the American consumer. John? My pleasure, Rich. My pleasure. John, do you want to take that? Yes. Tony, the way we are approaching non-gaming is that we really want to pioneer into categories where REITs may not necessarily have been heavily trafficking and bidding and buying. We really have no competitive advantage in heavily marketed, heavily bid categories. And so what we're working hard to do, as we did in the case of Chelsea Piers, is identify either categories or subcategories, where we believe there are operators who have uniquely powerful, enduring relationships with their customers, and are producing economics that can support - more than richly support an OpCo/PropCo structure. It obviously takes a bit more time. But we're very excited about what we are learning and who we are meeting and who we're getting to know and the opportunities they represent. And I think, Tony, as we talked about with you around the whole technology tailwind theme, there are also cultural tailwinds out there, and we think there are certain experiential sectors, especially at the higher end we're going to have tremendous cultural and demographic tailwind behind them for the next 10 to 20 years. And that's where we see our opportunity. It's really not in the commodity categories of triple-net. It should. If this category behaves the way, certainly so many other categories have Tony, that have undergone an institutionalization process. Yes, the prices should go higher. Our mission, we would work hard at every single day at VICI to make sure our cost of capital improves at a rate equal to or in excess of the velocity of cap rate compression. But it just stands to reason that these assets should attract higher prices as time goes on, as everyone recognizes that they came through really, a totally unforeseen magnitude of crisis. And making to better than just about any consumer discretionary sector out there as a real estate asset class, so yes, you have to think, especially as people truly start calling out from under the rock to COVID, that we should see what -- but frankly, I joined VICI four years ago, which is to take part in the next cap rate compression story in the American commercial real estate. John will take the first part and David can take second. It could be. It could be all of the above, Stephen. The fact that they're not heavily bid could mean there are better bargains to be had. But it could also be exactly to your last point that that we can afford to pay and justify paying maybe a somewhat tighter cap rate, because of the nature of the asset, the risk profile of the asset, the barriers to entry, and what is very proven durability of the asset over the long-term. So, I hope this doesn't sound like sort of vague answer, but it will be so situation specific. Thanks, Stephen. John? Barry, if I could just add on something that kind of goes back to my opening remarks around VICI's growth in 2020. Someone could rightfully say, yes, okay, well, the markets already priced that growth in. And yet, what I don't think is being fully appreciated or valued in VICI is not only the growth we produced in 2020, and the growth trajectory that we bring in, in 2021. But the growth it is represented by that embedded growth pipeline, and just to get a little old school on you here, which I'm allowed to do because I'm really quite an old guy. I really encourage everybody to look at VICI on that old fashion, old school, price earnings growth ratio basis using our AFFO multiple in place of a PE multiple. And what you'll find especially looking over a multiyear period is that we will likely have in your calculations lowest peg ratios, you will find across the American REIT spectrum and certainly substantially below the peg of the S&P 500 at this current point in time. And again, I encourage a multiyear view because a lot of REITs are going to grow in 2021, because they shrank in 2020. And what you're getting with VICI a multiyear growth profile that goes into the future and just the way described Barry, thanks to the fact that in 2022, even if we couldn't get anything else done, we have got Centaur and the opportunity to call. John? John? Thank you, Todd. Our pleasure. Yes, I'll start there, Dan. I mean, Gabe and John can talk about the M&A landscape and outlook. But we have always historically I should say, we've kind of silly to use word always when the company is only about three years from its IPO as we are. But from the beginning, we have always tended to over equities the balance sheet in the interest of having firepower when opportunity strikes. And there may be a time -- there may have been a time some near-term dilution taken on, but that was near-term dilution endured for the sake of having a firepower to create long-term accretion to our ability to move very quickly when opportunity presents itself. We certainly do not intend to short change our shareholders, like keeping excess capital on the balance sheet for prolonged periods of time. But we're pretty confident, we're going to be able to put that capital to work. Yes. Dan, I was just going to add, I think one of the emerging dynamics that is powerful and positive is the growing recognition of the value of network effect in American gaming. Harrah's and then Caesars, obviously were the pioneers of true network effect in American gaming, and would still widely be considered to be the leaders through the power of Caesars rewards. But I think increasingly operators are recognizing in part because of sports betting that there is genuine value in creating network effect, and being -- having stores in as many jurisdictions as you can. And that we think is going to be a powerful force, especially once COVID clears away and continuing to drive M&A, and with a lot of the M&A driven not so much by the sellers need to get out as the buyers intense desire to get it. And there are markets in which buyer demand can create incremental supply. Yes. For our market access, also, and true market access being more valuable onto yourself and more valuable to your partners. Whether it be Barstool or William Hill, FanDuel, DraftKings, whoever your partner may be. David, do you want to take that? Yes. No, it's a very good question, John. And that would certainly be probably the most meaningful way, which would be a capital provider as great operators envision and execute what the whole sports betting sports culture sports viewing experience can be within a casino. John, I don't know if you've had a chance yet to go to Derek Stevens, new asset in downtown Las Vegas. But it is a great example. John has been there. John, our John Payne has been there. And John, maybe you can talk about it as an example of what we would certainly be happy with our tenants to fund, given the magnitude of vision that Derek has realized there. John Payne? Thank you, John. Hey, John. John or David? Thank you, John. John can answer that in a moment, David, but I will just start by pointing out that this week we all learned of course, coke industries which has a rather strong record of capital allocation, it seems that they put capital in the Las Vegas, which I took as a net positive. But anyway, John, you want to answer David's question? Thank you, David. David or Danny? Yes, it's an interesting way to phrase it. I mean, what we've been doing is going and looking or as I described earlier Jay, off market categories where we should typically not gone. So we are much more oriented to going and finding what we most want to invest in as opposed to waiting the market to present opportunities to us, because the market tends to present opportunities to it would be better that are by definition more mainstream and commoditized. Thank you. Yes. Well, Spenser, good to hear from you. We actually don't have any assets within New York State right now. But I wouldn't say about New York State is what I would say generally, in terms of how we're viewing sports betting, which is really as a key means of market or audience expansion. There will be a lot -- once New York figures out what it wants to do in sports betting, sports betting and the culture around it will enable it to truly widen its audience in a way so many other states and operators are doing. So again, we don't have any highly informed thoughts around New York, but very excited about what this means for gaming nationwide. Well, by REIT law or legislation, Spenser, rent variation has to be based on revenue. REITs are not allowed profit participation. So for that reason, we would expect to see all kinds of variable rent mechanisms continue to be revenue based. I think that's the right way to put it, David. Thanks. Thank you, Amy. In closing, we thank you for your engaging with us this morning. As you can tell, we are very excited about our present situation, our near-term opportunities and our long-term prospects. We've been saying since we started in 2017, the gaming real estate represents the next great institutionalization story in American commercial real estate. Our conviction behind that thesis has only grown stronger, and we believe can be fully realized as we collectively witness the roaring back of the American consumer. Thanks again, everyone. Bye for now."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. 2020 was another busy year for VICI as our hard work continues to pay off. In 2020, our team completed nearly $4.6 billion of transaction activity, growing our annualized revenue by approximately $360 million, or 37%. Throughout the year, we worked closely with each of our tenants as the pandemic unfolded to provide short-term solutions on and as needed basis. As Ed stated, our cash rent collection track record of 100% to-date is a testament to the quality and strength of our business model and our collaborative approach with our tenants. As you are undoubtedly aware, the recovery of the gaming industry has demonstrated that despite the many challenges over the past year, the consumer has not found a replacement with a bricks and mortar casino experience. Our portfolio of industry leading assets and regional markets continues to demonstrate margin expansion, and in some cases profitability above 2019 levels. While our Las Vegas properties, led by Tom Reeg, Bret Yunker, Anthony Corrado and the entire team at Caesars Entertainment continue to outperform peers on the strip. As we start 2021, we have the experience and credibility to explore opportunities both within and beyond gaming. And we're very encouraged by the volume and quality of potential transactions we see ahead. It is important to remember that for VICI, underwriting and investing in different sectors is not and either or. We continue to develop relations with gaming operators. We look for ways to support existing tenants' growth, and we continue to spend time studying and meeting with operators in sectors beyond gaming, in order to be prepared to transact when the right opportunities come together. Our gaming investments will likely continue to dwarf our non-gaming investments, due to the sheer financial magnitude generated by gaming assets. However, we believe that growing our portfolio accretively through sector and geographic diversification, while maintaining prudent risk levels will yield the superior returns our shareholders deserve. We believe VICI is in great position to continue our industry leading growth. And we'll abide by the same principles that have driven our success to-date. We work hard with integrity to be the real estate partner of choice. We do fair deals, and we collaborate with our partners to create value for all parties. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and our guidance. Rich, I'm not sure that that's the exact way I think about it. I think that ROFR just has an opportunity,, obviously as the operators need to decide at some point, if they ever want to monetize their real estate. We sure would like to have own real estate in a new market, which we think is going to do great well. We're very excited about the new tenant that we're going to have in Southern Indiana. I've known that The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for almost 20 years now from my old job when I worked at Caesars, and we're excited to help them expand their portfolio for the first time outside of tribal land. So, again, we - as you've seen with other deals, Rich, when we negotiate, and we do try to add to our embedded growth pipeline. And that's how this came about. In Danville, we'll just have to see if the operator ultimately wants to sell real estate. Yes. Rich, I'll go out this first and my colleagues can jump in. First, it starts with the relationship of understanding who your partner is. And as I just mentioned, I've been fortunate to have a relationship with the tribe and watch them grow their incredible business in North Carolina to record levels, as well as the regional business, Rich, as you know, has rebounded tremendously when there weren't many restrictions on the business. So the pandemic started in March and April, the casino shut down. But as they reopened in places like Southern Indiana, we've seen them open with the consumer returning to the business, as well as a margin or an operating model that's much more efficient than ever before. And I give great credit to our operators to do that. And so, as we went into this deal, we put all of those together, we talked to the tenant, we understand how they're going to operate business, and we develop the plan from there. But critical part is understanding how this business is going to rebound as the consumer comes back to it. We're very - again, I'll repeat, we're very excited to have them as our sixth tenant and running the Southern Indiana property. Yes. Absolutely. Good morning, Stephen. Look, there aren't any markets that we look at that we wouldn't study right now. We'd like the fact that we have a balanced portfolio. We've said that since we started the company, and I think we'll continue to have a balanced portfolio. We'd like to own assets in these regional markets, and we've talked about how resilient they've been and we've talked about how they change with operating model. But we're also big believers in Las Vegas ever since we started this company, not only assets on the strip, but also in downtown and local. So Stephen, we'll continue to turn over every rock and look at opportunities and all of the gaming market. That doesn't mean that we'll invest in every market, but we are sure we will take the time to meet with operators and talk about how they're thinking about how we can help them grow. And I'll turn it over to David to take the second part. Yes. So, you talked about something we're very proud of that we've worked on three years is building this embedded pipeline, with the deals that we've announced, and though we will continue to talk to our partner in Caesars about what they are seeing ahead, and what they are feeling about the Las Vegas market. And do they still see LA as they did when the Eldorado team took over Caesars but they may have one or two incremental assets that they don't feel like they need in their portfolio, and they would end up going through a sales process. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we're big believers in Las Vegas. We think that's the market that is going to rebound in all segments. And so they want to move forward with the sale. We're obviously very interested in owning more real estate of those assets that we have ROFRs. You also mentioned the put call of the two great Indiana assets in Indianapolis that come due, you're right on point, next year. And again, we'll continue to have talks with our partner about that. So two tremendous opportunities for us that we really worked on to develop over the years, with our embedded -- creating our embedded pipeline. As it pertains to timing, we'll just have to continue to have discussions with our partners on that. Barry, I will have to continue to study that, but not specifically at this time. But we'll have to continue to understand would there be an opportunity. Yes, it's a great question. It's exciting to see the tribes move into commercial gaming, because they've done so well in their original casinos. And so you're asking, will there be other tribes that will look at commercial gaming opportunity? I think there will be. And I think we do have relationships with numerous tribes, just based on my experience path, about 20 years' experience working at Caesars and working the Native American tribal developments. So, we'll continue to, to meet with them, understand what they like to diversify outside their nation. And if they do, look for opportunities where we can work together. And I hope that trend continues, because I think it's quite exciting for the nations that are doing this audits that we've got a relationship with the Seminoles in the Eastern Band of Cherokees. Yes, it's a great question. There's no doubt that the resiliency of the gaming operators during the pandemic has caught people's eyes. When a lot of industries are -- some are still talking about cash or burns, and regional gaming companies are talking about record EBITDA, it's going to catch the attention of many people that invest in the hospitality or experiential space. So, your question is, will others come into the space, there's no doubt that others are looking at it, because of how well these assets have performed and the magnitude of cash flows. But as you know, the operating business is quite complex, and it had some licensing requirements. But I do think over time, you'll see more groups getting into the business because it's not only the bricks and mortar, but to the Ed's comments at the beginning how exciting the growth path is, when you tie in sports betting and potentially I-gaming. Well, I'll start Carlo. I can't remember before the pandemic, what went on. I seem to have forgotten all of that. But no, look, I tried to have a constant dialogue, not only with our current tenants, but with all the operators in the gaming space. And I think as we think about underwriting, maybe we've talked more about rent coverage just due to what happened in the pandemic. But I think, Ed touched on this as well, it's just been exciting to watch the operators change their business model, or refine their business model so that when they come out of this pandemic, and I do believe we're going to come out of it, that they're operating these businesses just so much more efficiently than guys like I did 15-years ago. And that's exciting Carlo, and those are the type of conversations that we're having. As it pertains to transactions, I mean, we just continued to try to understand how the OpCos want to grow their business and is there an opportunity for our company to help them do that. And then obviously, there's a few levers of, if we do get into negotiations that you talked about, cap rate and coverage and escalation, all that. None of those have necessarily changed. So that's how I'd answer that question, Carlo. I don't know if Ed wants to add anything or David, but that's how I leave it. Correct. If you're asking about when they're the commercial operator Southern Indiana, they'll follow the same rules a commercial operator, whether it's Caesars or Penn, or any of them, the same rules will apply to them because the facility is not on tribal land. They're very similar to the Seminoles in they are Hard Rock brand. I think you've probably followed that they have numerous casinos around the United States that they operate. Can you repeat? Did we share the what? Yes, that's a development project that is just getting started. So there's information about Caesars and they won the license and their development plan is there, but it's just getting started. No, I think Ed had talked about. Look, I'm spending my time, it's nice to be able to talk to the operators where, they're now focused on how to reopen and how to be safe. And they've done all that. Right now they can begin to talk about how do we grow and where do we want to go and how is the sports betting helping attract new customers and those things. And so it's nice to begin to have the growth conversations again. John, you might have been there. It's a really well done brand new facility in downtown Las Vegas that is centered around really a lot around sports betting and the uniqueness there and the type of customer that likes that type of facility. And so, anyway, it's just a great example of the trends that are going on right now in the first build from scratch casino during this what I'd say, sports betting trend or let's say since it's a really neat place. Yes, John. It is an exciting time. I mean, again, I'm 25 years into this, and I can't think of a time that has so many different levers of growth for this industry. Most calls are talking about sports betting and iGaming. And you just brought up a whole another opportunity that is out there where there's the new development opportunities for operators to expand their network. And it is quite exciting, and whether Texas comes but there's already the states that you mentioned with its Virginia and Nebraska, potentially New York that are three big opportunities. So, it is an exciting time. It's obviously something that we talk to our tenants or future tenants about to see, is there a way to structure that makes sense for VICI and our triple-net model, and we'll just continue to study. John, the normalization of gaming throughout the United States, it's just amazing right now. And it's great to be in the space that we're in, and it's great to see the success of our operators. Well, the process is it -- right now just so we're clear, I mean, we own Southern Indiana right now. I think you know that. Central. David, you want to take that? David, look, I touched on it earlier on the call that and I probably sound like a broken record in my three years in this job. I mean, we're big believers in Las Vegas, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic. This is city that has multiple layers, levers of revenue. We think that the FIT customer is going to recover. We think the Vice business, they're going to be way ahead of many other U.S. destination cities. We think that plane supply will be added back to this market quicker than most destination markets, maybe faster than any market. And so, we're believers in this market, Dave, and the performance in Las Vegas has been people like to compare first 2019 and 2020. I think that's a little unfair. I like to compare the performance of Las Vegas versus other U.S. destination cities. And when you look at the performance of Las Vegas, in 2020, which is probably going to be one of their worst year ever. We'll compare it to New York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco, Orlando, I mean, this is the city that's very resilient, and the teams there are working very hard. The other thing, David, I'll say is that we've seen this margin expansion in the regional markets, because revenues have come back close to '19 levels. When Las Vegas fees revenues come back to that type of level, I think you're going to see similar margin expansion at many of these operators, because they've worked very hard to change the operating model. And so we'll have to see that because revenues are going to come back. So anyway, that's just a long way of saying we're believers in the market, the strip and we talked about circa in downtown and how downtown's changing. And then the results out of the local market of, what I've seen from Red Rock results and Voyage [ph] results that you have those business seem strong. So anyway, we like the market and we'll continue to see if there's opportunities for us."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I want to start with our balance sheet. And since emergence, we've maintained a relentless focus on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles, and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. 2020 put forth and VICI was able to navigate some very heavy weather, as we continue to transform our balance sheet, all while maintaining ample liquidity and never drawing on our revolver. Just to summarize, in June 2020, we raised $662 million of equity through a 29.9 million share forward sale agreement. We still have 26.9 million shares outstanding, representing approximately $547.9 million in remaining net proceeds as at year-end. In February 2020, we raised $200 million of net proceeds through our ATM program. And as we've discussed with many of you, we're on a mission of achieving an investment grade rating, and during 2020 we continue down this path. Last February, we closed on $2.5 billion of an unsecured notes offering comprised of a mix of five, seven and 10 year notes at a blended interest rate of 3.8%, continuing to stagger our maturity profile. $2 billion of these proceeds were used to fund the Eldorado transaction, and the remaining $500 million of these proceeds were used to retire the 8% secured second lien notes. During 2020, we significantly improved our composition in the weighted cost of debt. At emergence, we had 100% secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.49%, and a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years. As we sit here today, 69% of our debt is unsecured, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18% and a weighted average maturity of 6.1 years with no maturities until 2024. As of December 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately 5.8 times. This ratio is not reflective of our true run rate leverage as it does not include a full 12-months of income from the Eldorado transaction, meaning if you take into consideration of full 12-months of rent from that transaction, our leverage would be well within our stated range of maintaining a net leverage ratio between 5 and 5.5 times. And as of year-end, we currently had approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity, providing ample flexibility for future accretive growth. Just to reiterate, 2020 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet, which are, to maintain a disciplined composition and laddering of debt, whereby in any one year, we strive to have less than 20% of our total debt coming due, safeguarding the company's balance sheet against future market volatility. We're going to opportunistically access the capital markets, to lock in funding certainty for all transactions and develop continued access in partnership from the equity and credit markets to finance accretive acquisitions. As I mentioned, our goal is to maintain a long-term target leverage ratio of between 5 and 5.5 times on a net debt to EBITDA basis, and ultimately migrate the balance sheet to that unsecured issuer and ultimately achieve an investment grade rating. Just turning to the income statement, total GAAP revenues in Q4 increased 57% over Q4 '19 to $373 million. For the full year 2020, total GAAP revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 37% over 2019. These increases, as John mentioned, was a result of adding approximately $360 million of annual revenues during the year from the closing of the Eldorado transaction, the Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage, the Chelsea Piers mortgage and the Jack Cleveland Thistledown acquisition and related loans. AFFO for the fourth quarter was $251.7 million or $0.46 per diluted share, bringing full year 2020 AFFO to $835.8 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. AFFO increased 28.7% year-over-year, while AFFO per diluted share increased approximately 10.8% over the prior year, which is due to the increased share count and resulting temporary dilution in the first half of 2020 from the June 2019 equity offering. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the significant increase in EBITDA, as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in high 90% range, when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $8.1 million for the quarter, which we believe represents a good quarterly run rate going forward, and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.2% for the quarter, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. As always, for additional transparency, we point you to our quarterly financial supplement for a detailed breakdown of our revenue and lease streams, which is located in the Investors section of our website, under the menu heading financials. We welcome any feedback on materials. Turning to guidance, we're initiating AFFO guidance for 2021 in both absolute dollars, as well as a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning in January 2020, we were required to implement the CECL accounting standard, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, going forward, our guidance will be focused on AFFO as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments, and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. AFFO guidance for the year ending December 31, 2021, is estimated to be between $1,010 million and $1,035 million or between $1.82 and $1.87 per diluted share, which at the midpoint represents a 12.5% year-over-year growth in our AFFO per diluted share. These per share estimates reflect the dilutive impact of the pending $26.9 million forward sale shares, assuming settlement of the forward agreement on June 17, 2021, the maturity date of the agreement. In addition, these estimates do not include the impacts of any pending or possible future acquisitions, dispositions, capital markets activities, or any impact in the incremental equity drawdown from these forward shares. During the fourth quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.33 per share, which represents an annualized dividend of $1.32 per share. Our AFFO payout ratio for the fourth quarter was approximately 72%, in line with our long range target of 75%. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Tony, it's something that we've discussed the depth with rating agencies. We met with the agency several times during 2020, both on our regular checkup, but also as the pandemic was unfolding. And for us, it's really around the term loan. The term loan is secured by all, but one of our assets. And so we do not have a typical unencumbered asset pool like most traditional REITs do. So we need to refinance out of that secured term loan into the unsecured debt markets. And as we move into 2021 and into 2022, it's - we will sequence that refinancing of that term loan potentially into 2023, part and parcel with what may come in the acquisition and the pipeline, what sort of funding we may need for additional acquisitions. So, it's a - there's a clear path. GLPI has paved it and has proven that it's achievable tenant concentration. In of itself is not a gating factor, but just simply for VICI's cap stack and that term loan again securing all of our assets is - secured by all of our assets is the gaining item. Yes. Stephen, correct me if I'm wrong, I mix with pricing and kind of always think about capitalization. The pricing is maintained. The regional markets have come back. There is the level set, obviously not a lot of transactions, but the pricing in the regional markets is that or near where it was pre-COVID. TBD and Las Vegas, given a little bit slower ramp there. But as we think about our capital and our leverage, we're very focused on maintaining our leverage between that 5 and 5.5 times that we've talked about, that's back to Tony's question, something that's important for the agencies. And then a deal has to be accretive, where we talked with you all a lot about what we buy day one is what we live with for 35 years. So we have to ensure that we have the capital and underwriting is done on an on accretive basis to continue to grow our AFFO. Yes. Dan, good to talk to you. Look, as we've talked about with Chelsea Piers, it's opened the doors open their eyes open increase the dialogue around non-gaming in a descriptive way in the beginning, right non-commodity, high quality real estate. And with any deal, we can't talk about specific timing and whatnot. But we would continue to meet with, discuss with and have conversations with great operators that have great real estate that might fit in our portfolio. So, can't say exactly when the next deal will come. But we're optimistic that there will be some more non-gaming this year. But again, it's just to reiterate what John said, it's not an either or. We're very active on the acquisition front and as we've started the conversation working to deploy that capital that we have on our balance sheet. Yes. John it's a question that we -- the similar questions that we got a lot when we merged right, as people recall it. We had the three call properties that we could call it a tent gap, which ultimately folded into the other auto transaction that we announced in June of '19. But John touched on it. We've worked hard to build this embedded growth pipeline. So it's a combination of ensuring that we have consistent annual growth. It's working with Tom and Bret and Anthony and their team and what makes sense for their capital needs and their ultimate sale of those assets. And then you're right, the performance of the assets will be kind of a third factor and a third lever, but those call perhaps for that put call runs from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. So, at some point between that period of time, we're going to be thrilled down those that have a great cap rate which should be highly accretive. But there's a myriad of factors that go into it. And we're excited to have that embedded growth. Yes. No, John, it's a good question. And one of the things we did get with the Eldorado transaction is that those would fold into the master lease. If you recall, we had a ROFR on those originally, and we converted that to a foot call. And those will fold into the master lease. So they will benefit from the corporate guarantee. And the asset level coverage is something that we will take into consideration, but knowing that they fold into the benefit of the master leases gives VICI embedded enhanced protection. And ultimately, part of the reason, Tom and team were willing to do the set up the put call is Tom's vision of bringing back and goal of achieving an investment grade rating on their side, right? This provides significant liquidity to pay down debt or continue their growth profile and improve the credit of our tenant, which will accrue through to VICI enhanced rent protections. Yes, I can take that. Hey, it's David. So Margaritaville, and just put the 10 leases in perspective, right, there's a variable rent component, which is a small percentage of the overall rent that we get on an annual basis. From Margaritaville, it's $3 million as a $23.5 million of annual rent. And for Margaritaville, that we did not earn the escalator at that property, since the rent did not exceed the prior revenue metrics, or did not exceed the prior revenue metrics. And so, that was a variable rent decrease, and that was less than $100,000 decrease. So very, very de minimis on our total base rent. And then the Greektown that's coming up in June. And again, the variable component is $6.4 million out of the $55.5 million, $$55.6 million of total rent we collect, that $6.4 million of variable rent is only 50 basis points of our total revenue. So a small component of our total rent base again. And we'll have to see how that plays out given that's coming up in June. Yes, that's right. Exactly. Thanks, Spenser."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that today's conference is being recorded today, October 29. 2020. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2020 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, intend, project, or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our third quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabriel Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. As we sit here today VICI is a few weeks past her third birthday. We've done a lot of work in three years and in quarter three of this year our work over the past three years truly crystallized. In Q3, 2020 we executed the following strategic growth and activities. We closed on the acquisition of three new properties. Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's New Orleans, Harrah's Laughlin. We accretively added incremental rent at our two Las Vegas properties, Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas. We provided a $400 million mortgage on the Caesars Forum Convention Center. And we made our first investment outside of gaming, with our $80 million financing of Chelsea Piers in New York, of which I'll say more in a moment. These strategic accomplishments in Q3 led to the following financial accomplishments. We grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by 41.9%. We grew AFFO year-over-year by 38.4%. We increased our dividend by 10.9%. And not to be taken for granted, since the COVID-19 crisis began, we have collected 100% of our rent through October in cash. All told looking forward, these VICI growth activities in Q3 added annualized rent and income from loans of $288 million and a blended unlevered yield of 7.80%. Granted all American REITs haven't reported yet, but in what we've seen so far few other American REITs have posted these kinds of financial growth numbers in Q3 2020. And this growth for VICI takes place against the COVID-19 backdrop that has significantly degraded the financial results of many American REITs. And if I could just take a moment, I would note that, much of the commentary we've seen so far, we have seen VICI described as having met its expected results for Q3. And on the one hand, we're glad that we were expecting to grow in the way we have, but we hope it is not lost on anybody that the growth we did produce is truly remarkable. And this surge of growth consummated in the third quarter of 2020 comes in our third year of real estate investment management. Over this three-year period on an annualized run rate basis, we have grown our rent since emergent by 100% or $633 million, while significantly lowering our leverage from 8.5 times to the low end of our target range of between 5.0 and 5.5 times. VICI stands here today with a substantially bigger and moreover higher-quality portfolio with much lower leverage and a better laddered debt structure. And as I spoke of a moment ago, in Q3 we also made our first allocation of capital outside of gaming. Chelsea Piers is no doubt well known to those of you who live and work in New York. For anyone, who doesn't know Chelsea Piers well, this morning we uploaded to our website www.viciproperties.com a deck that summarizes the transaction and the asset. So the most valuable elements of the deck are the photos. Only photos not words can begin to do justice to the magnitude and experiential diversity of this asset. But here are a few words. Chelsea Piers is a 780,000 square foot facility on the Hudson River in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. It is New York's largest and best equipped sports and recreation facility. It offers one of New York's biggest and most dramatically situated banquet location. Finally, and very valuably, in the time of unprecedented film production activity, it offers the largest film production space in Manhattan. Roland Betts, Tom Bernstein and David Tewksbury founded Chelsea Piers in 1995. They remain in charge today. And through their 25 years of ownership and management, they have expertly and energetically steered Chelsea Piers through such past crises as 9/11, the Great Financial Crisis and Hurricane Sandy. We have confidence that under their continuing leadership, Chelsea Piers will recover strongly as the COVID-19 crisis eventually subsides and as New Yorkers once again return to New York's most spacious place to play and perform. While we're excited about our new financing partnership with Chelsea Piers, a partnership that could become longer term in nature, we remain very glad and very proud to be principally invested in American gaming real estate, a sector that has arguably performed better than any other place-based experiential sector during this COVID-19 crisis. To tell you more about how our tenants are doing and how we remain focused on gaming growth, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Payne. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. [Indiscernible] continuing our work to build the best company in our sector by focusing on the [Indiscernible] from accretive transactions and expanding our portfolio of the best-in-class operators. To that end [Indiscernible] Eldorado-Caesars merger originally announced in June 2019. That said [Indiscernible] Caesars for total consideration [Indiscernible].\nEd Pitoniak: Hey, John. John, my apologies. Your signal is breaking up quite badly. If you'd like, we could have David read your remarks.\nJohn Payne: Please do. I apologize. It must be this -- I'm in New Orleans and we have a hurricane last night. So why don't you do that Ed?\nEd Pitoniak: Okay. David do you want to take it from there?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Sorry about that, everybody. As John was saying and I think he broke up. To that end, as many of you know, on July 20 we completed our transformative transaction as part of the Eldorado-Caesars merger, originally announced in June 2019. We acquired Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's Laughlin and Harrah's New Orleans and modified our existing leases with Caesars for total consideration of $3.2 billion. This transaction added $253 million of incremental annual rent for VICI, strengthened the terms of our leases with Caesars and restocked our embedded growth pipeline through ROFRs on two Las Vegas strip assets, a put-call agreement on Harrah's Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand in Indianapolis and a ROFR on Horseshoe, Baltimore. Additionally in July, we agreed to fund the $18 million expansion at JACK Thistledown in exchange for incremental rent at a 10% cap rate. We also quickly and efficiently partnered with JACK Entertainment by providing them access to incremental liquidity. This demonstrates some of the benefits of having VICI as a capital partner, as we support our tenants in ways that preserve and create long-term value for all parties. Finally, as Ed highlighted during the quarter, we executed on an $80 million loan transaction with Chelsea Piers in New York City. We are very excited to announce this transaction involving an incomparable experiential asset in an incomparable city. Importantly, we believe this investment represents a meaningful partnership and potentially provides VICI a path to a longer-term relationship with Chelsea Piers, potentially adding sector and geographic diversification to our real estate portfolio over time. As we said before, we believe the transaction market within gaming is robust and will likely dwarf transactions that we may pursue outside of gaming just given the sheer magnitude and financial productivity of gaming assets. Despite over $8.2 billion of transaction activity since we started VICI three years ago, our growth story remains in the very early innings and we're excited about what is to come. You have seen us shift from defense to offense by announcing multiple transactions over the past two quarters. We always strive to do fair deals and we believe this is part of what has driven our success. We are often asked if we are going to slow down for a while, or take a break as others do. Given all the transactions we have done in a short period of time, the answer is a resounding no. You should expect us to consider participating in any fair process for an asset sale within gaming. Given our broad investment spectrum, we continue to believe that a bid that includes refinancing is likely to yield the greatest amount of proceeds for the seller of an asset and their stakeholders, giving our business the greatest prospects for growth. With respect to the operating environment, we are very proud of the way our tenants have reopened and managed our properties in the current operating environment. Despite many of the restrictions and challenges imposed on properties across the nation, our assets continue to showcase superiority relative to many other real estate sectors, as the brick-and-mortar casino experience continues to prove its durability. John has personally visited numerous assets across regional markets and was in Las Vegas earlier this week and has been quite impressed with many of the unique operational changes that the operators have done to improve and protect the guest experience, many of which have enhanced profitability. We are extremely proud to be invested primarily in gaming and we stand ready to support the growth initiatives of our tenants and other operators through fair lease terms, integrity and flexible long-term capital. I'll now touch on balance sheet and run through our financial results. Just turning to the income statement. Total GAAP revenues in Q3, '20 increased 52.6% over Q3, 2019 to $339.7 million. GAAP revenues included $26.2 million of non-cash items. Accordingly, total cash revenues in Q3, '20 were $313.5 million, an increase of 39.3% over Q3, '19. These year-over-year increases were the result of adding $88 million of rent and income from the loans during the quarter primarily as a result of closing the Eldorado transaction; the Caesars Forum mortgage; the Hard Rock Cincinnati and Century acquisitions which closed in late 2019; and the JACK Cleveland Thistledown acquisition and related loan which closed in January of 2020. AFFO was $227.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 38.4% over Q3, 2019 and AFFO per share increased 22.9% over Q3, 2019. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 15%, primarily as a result of the settlement of our June 2019 forward sale agreements in June 2020, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in advance of closing on our portion of the Eldorado-Caesars transaction. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, as flow-through was 100.3% for the quarter and margins expanded further into the high-90% range. Our G&A was $8 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was just 2.4%, which is in line with our full year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. I'd like to just highlight two items on the income statement. The first is our ongoing CECL allowance. In the third quarter, the non-cash CECL allowance was $177.1 million, which is primarily related to the new investments we made during the quarter. As a reminder, when new investments close, we record an initial CECL allowance through the P&L. Second is the $333.4 million gain upon lease modification. When we modified our leases as part of the Eldorado transaction, we were required to reassess our lease classification. And accordingly, we reclassified all of our Caesars leases to sales-type leases under ASC 842 and marked them to market resulting in a onetime gain. These items are both non-cash. As such, there is no impact to AFFO or AFFO per share. We continue to point investors to AFFO and AFFO per share, as we believe that should be the primary metric used to evaluate our financial performance and our ability to pay dividends. Just touching on the balance sheet and our capital markets activity. On September 28, we settled three million shares from the June 2020 forward sale agreement, realizing net proceeds of $63 million of cash on to our balance sheet. On September 18, we closed on the $400 million Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage with Caesars, utilizing cash on our balance sheet. And then as has been mentioned, on October 31, we closed on the $80 million mortgage with Chelsea Piers of which we funded an initial $65 million term loan with cash on our balance sheet and the remaining $15 million remains undrawn. This loan came about through a combination of a refinancing process Chelsea Piers undertook this summer, as well as a long-term relationship with the principals. The loan has an interest rate of 7%, a term of seven years and is the only loan in the cap stack of what is truly an amazing and irreplaceable asset in New York. And as we've spoken about on July 20, we closed on our portion of the Eldorado-Caesars transaction, adding $253 million of annual rent to our portfolio through the acquisition of three Harrah's assets and the acquisition of incremental rent from our Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas asset for total consideration of approximately $3.2 billion in cash. We utilized the proceeds from the settlement of the June 2019 forward sale agreements, as well as the $2 billion of proceeds from the February bond offering that were previously held in escrow to fund the transaction. Our total outstanding debt at quarter-end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.4 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of September 30, our net debt to actual LTM-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 6.5 times. This ratio is not reflective of our true leverage, as it does not include a full 12 months of income from the Eldorado transaction and therefore does not represent our true run rate leverage levels, which is well within our stated range of maintaining net leverage between five and 5.5 times. We currently have approximately $1.7 billion in available liquidity comprised of approximately $144.1 million in cash on hand, $20 million in short-term investments, $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. And then, in addition, the company has access to approximately $557 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares that are subject to the June 2020 forward sale agreement. During the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.33 based on the annualized dividend of $1.32 per share. This represented an increase in the dividend of 10.9%, one of the highest increases from any REIT during 2020. Our AFFO payout ratio for the third quarter was 76.7%, in line with our long-range target of 75%. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we'd like to take any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Your line is open.\nRich Hightower: And John if you're listening, all the best with storm cleanup down there.\nJohn Payne: I'm on, I don't know if you can hear me now. I've moved locations and tried again.\nRich Hightower: Yes. Yes. No, the cell towers sound like they're working. So -- but I know what that's like. So, as I said all the best, but yes -- I appreciate guys the bit of background on the Chelsea Piers loan. But maybe just to talk about credit underwriting for a second here. So, help us understand the security behind VICI's loan? Does the owner own the land beneath the facility, or is it just the improvement? I know you said that VICI's loan is the only one in the cap stack. But help us understand maybe the implied equity that sits beneath VICI and then where the loan sits maybe as an expression of terms of EBITDA or something along those lines? Just help us understand some of the details there if you don't mind.\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Thanks Rich. There's a ground lease on -- or there's a ground lease even though it's in the river. Some of the peers are in the river with the Hudson Park Trust, but they own the peers and all the improvements and has that 28 acres 780,000 square feet. Financial metrics aren't public but it is a very, very low LTV when you think about the location and the size of the assets and the magnitude of EBITDA. This asset has a 25-year operating history. And as Ed said they've weathered 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, the Great Financial Crisis. And the revenue generators the complexity of this asset and their ability to generate consistently high EBITDA throughout the past 25 years there's been a reason that we're highly excited about this asset and excited to support Chelsea Piers. And obviously, New York was struck with COVID and some of the businesses did shut during the past few months. The majority of the businesses are reopening. The asset is generating productive EBITDA and the film studio business is blooming and going with just the global need for content. So, we're excited about this and what this may lead to in the future.\nRich Hightower: Okay, that's helpful David. And then just as far as that sort of longer-term potential there. I mean should we infer that a sale/leaseback transaction is at least somewhat plausible in the near to medium term, or is it too early to make that assumption?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, Rich, this is Ed. I think it'd be too early to make that assumption with any kind of utter certainty, but it's a relationship we've worked very hard to develop. It is a company that is expanding its footprint throughout at least the New York region. So, we're very eager as we are with all of our partners to focus on growing our relationships over the longer term.\nRich Hightower: Okay, got it. And then maybe just a quick one in a bit of a different direction. But look there's been a lot of investment on the part of the operators around online sports betting. That's been obviously a pretty high-profile phenomenon lately. Would you see a chance for deal flow to VICI to increase specifically based on that? In other words where VICI would be a capital provider in the form of a sale/leaseback on a land-based facility, but where the proceeds would specifically be put towards sort of a non-land-based growth opportunity for the operator? And how do you sort of feel about trends in that area right now?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start and then turn it over to John. But I think this is one of the most exciting things going on in our industry right now Rich. I know there's a lot of focus on the total addressable market, a lot of focus on what kind of revenue and profit that gaming companies will yield directly from iGaming and sports betting. And those obviously could be very important new revenue and profit providers to our tenants making our tenants an even better credit for us in the future. I think though that certainly for me one of the most powerful things going on is that technology is proving to be a tailwind right now for gaming and thus for gaming real estate. And this comes during a period where you can pretty much separate real estate asset classes into those that are benefiting from technology, obviously data centers and cell towers as two key examples or they're suffering from technology. Malls obviously being an extreme example on that side. And I think this is a case where technology is creating a tailwind for gaming and thus for the gaming REIT. And one of the most powerful elements of this tailwind is that it is helping gaming companies potentially develop their next-generation of customers. Every consumer discretionary sector has to ask the question where does our next generation of customers come from? Because being a discretionary sector is inherently up to the discretion of any given generation as to whether or not they're going to become customers. And -- if you want to put it in the simplest terms this is a powerful way to engage the [Indiscernible] generation and turn them into that next generation, which we think is enormously positive for the long-term productivity and security of our assets. But I'll turn it over to John in terms of how else we're looking at it and our willingness to get behind our tenants with incremental capital. John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. I don't have much to add other than to say Rich, I think you -- over our three years you'll see we've been quite creative in working on deals and wanting to help our tenants grow. I do want to reiterate one thing -- David did a great job with my opening remarks and I apologize for being cut-off. But I did want to reiterate how proud our company is of our tenants' performance. I think sometimes it gets glossed over when many hospitality industries are talking about cash burn still. And we have operators in this space talking about record EBITDA and margins up 1,000 points. And I just want to stress that that really is incredible in the environment that we are in right now and it's a complement to the operators and how creative they've been. So Rich that's our comments on that question.\nRich Hightower: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open. \nSmedes Rose: Hi. I wanted just to ask you there's a number of regulatory issues on the ballot this year either putting in casinos in cities like Virginia or setting limits in Colorado. What -- are there anything that stands out to you as making regions more or less interesting depending on the outcome of those votes?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: I'll -- yes I'll jump in here. I think it's always interesting to watch what is on the ballots. I think Virginia is one that is going to have some opportunity. I do -- we'll see what happens in a few days. But I do think that's going to allow commercial gaming in that state and some new developments. And that could provide some opportunity for us or it could provide some opportunity for a tenant and make them continuing to be stronger. We'll have to watch Nebraska. I don't know how that is moving forward. And then to the answer to the question, we just answered about sports betting there are a number of states that are looking to move that forward and we'll see how that plays out. So -- and then obviously in Colorado, they're just kind of normalizing the casino environment by increasing debt limits, which will be good for the operators there. So all should be pretty positive. I'm watching Virginia closely though.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to switch back. You made for your major first investment in a non-gaming entity. John, obviously has very deep relationships in the gaming side. Going forward, how will you continue to look for non-gaming opportunities? And maybe you could just talk about -- you mentioned a long-term relationship with Chelsea Piers. But what -- could you talk a little bit about more who the relationship is with and kind of what brought you to the table as they considered or as they went through recapitalization?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Smedes, this is Ed. Yes, I personally have had a long-term relationship with the Chelsea Piers founders. But as a more general principle in practice what we very much intend to take advantage of at VICI is through both our management team and our Board we have lifetime's worth of engagement with other real estate -- experiential real estate asset classes. And we will use those relationships much in the way we've been able to enormously capitalize on John's unrivaled relationships in American gaming. And from the beginning we set VICI up as an experiential real estate investment trust. And we have always used as our absolute guiding premise that superior long-term returns in real estate investment management are generated through the ownership of superior real estate. So that is our greatest focus of all. Is a given piece of real estate truly superior in its marketplace and do its investment in operating characteristics promise superior longer-term returns? And Chelsea Piers ticked all those boxes and we're very confident that over time we'll continue to find opportunities like this in various experiential sectors.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Your line is open. \nGreg McGinniss: Hi, everyone. \nJohn Payne: Hey, Greg.\nGreg McGinniss: On the transaction front you -- Caesars still needs to sell those two Indiana assets that you guys own together whether you own and they operate. Can you just remind us what the process may look like for when they try to sell those operations and how that's going to impact the master lease?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. So we have put-call on the two Indianapolis assets. David will have to remind me the exact dates when they're active. So it's not a ROFR. It's very clear. We do have a put-call on that. And we love those assets. I actually was in Indianapolis about six weeks ago at those facilities. Great business, great performance and we'll be excited. They will be added into what we're now calling our regional master lease. And David I don't know if you want to add a little bit of the details on the put-call and the timing on that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Greg, I think you're asking about Southern Indiana and Hammond, but just the put-call starts in 2022 and runs till the end of 2024. But going back to Southern Indiana and Hammond, you're right, Caesars was required -- as part of the Eldorado, Caesars was required as part of the merger to sell three OpCos Evansville, Southern Indiana and Hammond. We own the real estate on Southern Indiana and Hammond. Those are processes that Caesars is running. We're not involved in those processes. If there is a sale of the OpCo, I think your question was around how does the rent change into the master lease, our total rent would not change but what it would create the opportunity for is tenant diversification for us. So we'll see how that will ultimately play out and how the bid processes work with what Caesars is required to do from Indiana.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. So we're not going to see a similar transaction deal that GLPI employed with Tropicana Evansville then? It's just going to be a transfer to the operator most likely?\nEd Pitoniak: Yeah, I think \u2013 yeah, that's the great assumption, Greg. And just to be clear, the rent within the master lease might change with a new operator in either one of those two assets but our total rent would not change. And we're very confident Caesars is running the process in such a way that we're going to be very happy with whoever ends up being our new tenants in those assets.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks. And then just a final question from me. Just curious what changed regarding the undeveloped land parcel acquisition, hereby, the forums and why are you no longer pursuing that one?\nEd Pitoniak: Yeah. So in a period of due diligence Greg, what we discovered is that there are various if you will entitlement and permitting issues surrounding that land that especially relate to Caesars' parking obligations. And it was not going to be easy to unwind those quickly. And given the magnitude of activity that Caesars is currently engaged in, in terms of integrating after the merger and undertaking the various activities that is we agreed that it was best for both of us. For the meantime we put that initiative aside and then perhaps return to it at a time when the dust has settled a bit post-merger.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJared Shojaian: Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about your appetite for underwriting additional real estate on the strip right now? And how do you think about how terms would compare today in this depressed environment versus pre-COVID?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Do you want me to touch on that? Sure. Well. I was just out in Las Vegas as David said this week. So I had an opportunity to be on the strip and meet with operators throughout the whole city. So we continue to be excited about this market long term. Clearly Las Vegas has to get over not having meeting business right now and some international business, but we believe that that will come back. It really is amazing to think about the United States right now. And Las Vegas is down from its 2019 numbers, obviously, but there's still a lot of visitation going to Las Vegas. When you compare that to other U.S. cities like New York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco there's no comparison that the consumer has not found a substitute for their travel patterns to a place like Las Vegas. So that's a long way of saying, we believe in this market. We're long-term investors. Would we do a transaction here in the short-term? I think the operators are more likely to get some more of the operations under their belt after COVID and better understand what the true run rate of EBITDA is going to be. But if you're asking do we still believe in Las Vegas, I think the answer is a resounding yes.\nJared Shojaian: Right, okay. I think the genesis of my question is really more about just media reports out from last week and your ability to participate in how you would think about underwriting Las Vegas right now. I mean, would you -- do you think a significant discount from what you maybe would have paid back in January is probably more relevant if you were to pursue something? I mean, I guess that's really more of the genesis of the question.\nJohn Payne: And media reported -- you talked -- go ahead Ed. Go ahead.\nEd Pitoniak: I was going to say, Jared, that this is a situation in which you have to triangulate off of what is by I think everyone's agreement a temporary crisis that will have an end and true long-term value. And somebody that wants to sell or needs to sell during a crisis like this has to also be mindful of long-term value in the same way that the buyer does. So it's really hard to come up with a general answer as to what kind of discount should be applied given that we're talking about real estate, and in our case we would intend to hold for decades right? And so to what degree should a temporary crisis change the enduring value of an asset, I wish I could give you a really crisp cogent answer. But it's going to end up being so highly particular in terms of any trading that would take place amidst this temporary -- emphasis on temporary uncertainty. John, I don't know, if you want to add. \nJohn Payne: No. And I also think it's important we have -- if we were to ever transact the operating partner is critical. And of course most importantly, the going-in cap rate needs to be accretive. And so I assume you're asking about a large asset on the Las Vegas Strip. And like I said, we're always interested in hearing about great gaming asset strong markets like Las Vegas. \nJared Shojaian: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just one more for me. How do you guys think about a possible investment-grade credit rating and how that potentially could be helpful to your cost of capital in any way? I mean I think just in your leverage and liquidity and the resiliency of your rental strength throughout this pandemic, what do you think the rating agencies would want to see to make that move? And would that be helpful? \nDavid Kieske: Jared, it's David. Thanks for the question. The resounding yes, it would be helpful, right? The cost of capital would be reduced. The access to capital would be significantly increased. I think the investment-grade bond volume this year is 4 times is a high-yield volume which is having a record year. But for us it's really just getting rid of the term loan. The term loan is secured by all but one of our assets and that's prohibiting us for having a traditional REIT unencumbered asset pool. And that's the catalyst, so to speak that the agency is looking forward to -- which would allow for the flip into investment grade. We give GLPI a lot of credit for getting there and highlighting that tenant concentration in of itself is not a gating item. We have similar rent from Caesars that they have from Penn. So there is a path. And again it's just the repayment that term loan, which we'll work to do over the coming months and years here.\nJared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nEd Pitoniak: Hi, Barry.\nQ \u2013 Barry Jonas: Pre-COVID, we had Blackstone enter the space. We had another triple-net about to enter the gaming REIT space. Given the operating results operators are seeing now I'm curious if you expect more activity from some of those newer REITs to reemerge anytime soon? \nEd Pitoniak: Well if they're paying attention you would sure think so Barry. I mean, again, if you look across so many real estate asset classes right now and you ask the fundamental question, how are the tenants in a variety of asset class is doing? It's very hard to identify other than maybe again data centers and cell towers examples where the tenants are doing better than ours are in terms of profitability. That is obviously very much true in the regional markets.  But I do think you're going to see as you did last week, you're going to see pleasant surprises I think even from the big strip operators in terms of how well they've done on a relative basis. So yes, there should be greatly increased interest in gaming real estate, given the way the gaming real estate has been validated through this crisis. When John and David and I and the VICI team started telling our story three years ago, we were often asked the question. Well are you guys going to need a crisis in order for people to get comfortable with the durability of this real estate and its income streams? Then we said, well we don't think we need a crisis. But well what the hell we got one. And again I think, we really cannot be more pleased with the way our tenants have performed. I think what this crisis has demonstrated Barry is that gaming real estate is not -- emphasis on not commodity real estate. In real estate categories, they are relatively commoditized. In other words, one box is like another. And if I own a coffee shop or a gym or something else and I can threaten my landlord with moving to another commodity box a block away, I have a lot of leverage over the tenant. These are not commodity boxes. These are one-of-a-kind boxes. Pretty much the definition of irreplaceable or certainly, the definition of very difficult to substitute. And that tends to be a key characteristic of non-commodity high-value institutional-quality real estate is that it is not easily substituted and that the tenants occupying that real estate operate fundamentally good businesses. And our tenants operate fundamentally great businesses. \nQ \u2013 Barry Jonas: Great. And then just curious if you looked at Tropicana Evansville or if your exposure in that stake just made it less appealing from the start? \nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Well it's an odd situation. It was owned by a gaming REIT and it's now still owned by a gaming REIT. And I believe there was even an agreement that it could not be sold to another REIT. So it's a really good piece of real estate. I think GLPI has to be very glad they're going to continue to own it. They're going to own it with a good tenant. And we wish them the very best. And to your point Barry, we do obviously have very nice exposure already in Indiana with Southern Indiana and Hammond. And but we will be able to increase our exposure with what we think are two of the best assets in the state with the so-called Centaur assets.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Thanks so much guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nCarlo Santarelli: Hey guys, how are you? Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask -- so following up on a question earlier as it pertained to the large-scale asset in Las Vegas. At the way -- I guess this is big picture thinking about, I would love to get your opinion and get your expertise on it. But in a situation as we are today it would seem as though a sale/leaseback -- traditional sale/leaseback type of structure for a large asset like that in that market would be difficult, just given the cost of carrying on kind of the rental obligations over the near term, while the asset ramps up to obviously the capitalized multiple that would build into the valuation or said differently the EBITDA, it would be expected to get to over time. In that type of situation where maybe the buyer has to look out -- the opco buyer has to look out a little bit further, are there any types of structures that you guys could think of to potentially try and support the transaction while not necessarily putting all of the onus on the operator to carry certainly a large rental stream in the near term that's not overly kind of dilutive to yourselves as you make a financial contribution on the asset?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I'll take a first crack and then turn it over to John and David, Carlo. Would it be possible to come up with structures that would address that challenge that you rightly identified? Yes it would be possible to come up with structures and would do that. They would be complex by nature. Complex structures have a way of sometimes collapsing under the weight of their own complexity. But it definitely could be done by willing parties. There are creative ways to bridge these kinds of temporary devalue or revenue productivity issues. And we would certainly be -- as John has already talked about we are certainly able and willing to be creative in financing structures when the opportunity is right. John, David I don't know if you want to add to that? \nJohn Payne: No other than this -- you did a very good job Ed. I'll just add that we have the advantages of looking at real estate for the long term that hopefully over the next 30 years we look back at 2020 and it's just a blip. And so, Ed has answered your specific questions. But again I think one of the advantages we have is we're not going to be measured on what's going to happen in the business in the next month or quarter.\nCarlo Santarelli: That\u2019s great guys. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi, Thanks for taking my question. I think that this actually fits in some regard with the question you just answered. You have engaged more and more with traditional loans. They've been seemingly done as a purpose pitch. But in looking through the accounting last night it appears that they actually bear less risk than some of the core lease revenue streams that you have. I'm interested to hear you talk about how you think about those streams in terms of value and how you would have us think about them in terms of value particularly given the prior question is that, they could be used as part of a structure with a purpose.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes I'll turn it over to David in a moment David Katz. And the loan business can be a very effective tool for REITs at giving itself exposure to sectors it may be new to and gives them an opportunity to acquire and learn in if you will a less risky way for the absolute long term. I would say we're generally going to be biased toward using loans to put ourselves in a position to eventually we would hope acquire either the underlying real estate tied to that loan or otherwise acquire real estate within that sector because we are a REIT that's being engineered to last for decades and decades and decades. Loans obviously come due they get repaid. And then if capital gets returned you've got to go find another thing to do with it. So David I don't know if you want to add to add to that, David Kieske?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. No Ed, I think you covered it well. And David Katz I like the perfect pitch, the corporate path to long-term ownership, there will likely be some small percentage of our total investment base that we can utilize in the REIT structure to deploy capital in very safe, low LTV scenarios that may lead to a path of estate ownership over the long term. So that's something we're excited about and excited about continuing to use our capital accretively.\nDavid Katz: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jordan Bender with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nJordan Bender: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So with regional revenues maybe structurally lower given some of the turnoff in the non-gaming, but EBITDA is -- might be higher going forward. I was wondering how you think about structuring some of your future escalators and your resets that might be tied to revenue versus tied to EBITDA.\nEd Pitoniak: John, you want to take a first crack at that?\nJohn Payne: No, it's a great question. We actually have not been asked that question, but it's something that we will consider moving forward. I thought the question was going to be leading are those revenues necessarily going to be coming back? And I think what the operators have learned and through their abilities and their analytics is that some of that revenue was -- just simply had no margin to it. And so I was going to answer it to say it's not coming back. But your question about what will we think about leases in the way we do escalators differently, I'd say we're always flexible as we create new leases, if there's a way that's fair for both sides. And if there's a way that our escalators should be different and based on some numbers, we'll think -- we could think about that differently. Good question.\nJordan Bender: Thanks. And then, with some of that non-gaming, that might not be coming back and then access land at some of the properties, I was wondering your thoughts on possibly repurposing some of the way maybe something that's not in the gaming sector?\nEd Pitoniak: Yeah. It's an interesting question, Jordan. I mean I think we're talking obviously mainly about interior space. So we would really be talking about -- we'd be talking about repurposing interior space. And in that respect, I think especially, as sports betting evolves, it will be very interesting to see the way in which the sportsbook experience evolves and changes to meet what could be increased demand. And John was in Las Vegas this week for the opening at a D. And John, maybe for the benefit of everyone who wasn't there for that, maybe you can talk about the centrality of the sportsbook, sports bar experience of that brand-new asset.\nJohn Payne: Yeah. The Circa asset opened on Tuesday and very focused on the Gate and the sports betting and just a wonderful new facility in Downtown Las Vegas and centered as I said around the gambler. Now, back to your first question about operators and extra space, hypothetically, if they're not going to reopen their buffet, how will they reposition that and add other amenities? That's the beauty about our tenants. And they see opportunities to improve revenues or drive a different consumer to build in. They'll change what that space is used for. And I think you're going to see that happen over the coming years as they realize they were operating restaurants or other outlets that drove revenue, but weren't driving trips and weren't driving profitability. And how do they fill that space with new amenities that do that? And one could be larger sportsbooks as Ed mentioned. Very good question.\nJordan Bender: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask briefly about the -- I think you've approached this from a few different ways as it relates to some of the margins and changes that are occurring at the regional properties. And I'm just wondering at high level, at the end of the day does this change cap rates at all in your view? Are these like for instance -- with some of the fundamentals that we're starting to see here is there a way to possibly underwrite the growth or the normalization a little faster than maybe we would have done in the past? And just how do you think about how some of these changes in fundamentals could ultimately impact what you're willing to pay?\nEd Pitoniak: And Shaun, just so we're clear when you speak of the growth that we would be underwriting you mean the growth in tenant EBITDAR?\nShaun Kelley: Correct. Exactly, Ed. So the higher -- in fact, we're seeing 1,000 basis point type higher margins today. Is there a portion of this that you can underwrite/or do you need to see a lot more stability before you do?\nEd Pitoniak: Obviously, more time adds to more confidence and more certainty. But again, I think it's just -- it just blows me away what is reported what Red Rock has reported, what Penn reported today. And these are amazing numbers. And to produce them amidst this crisis the way they have, gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in how good our tenants are right? And I think I talked about in our Q2 call Shaun, at the end of the day so much of the value of real estate ends up residing in the quality of the tenant business, right? And our tenants' businesses are getting validated. Like almost nobody else is out there outside again of like data centers and cell towers, and try buying a data center for anything less than a more than a -- I don't know 3.75% cap. So, we obviously -- we have to underwrite in relation to our cost of capital, and there's no way around that. There shouldn't be any way around that. But what we would hope to see and what we believe we will see is that as the market recognizes the quality and security of our real estate in its cash flows our cost of capital will improve commensurately and we will be potentially in a position to pay more for these assets and happily pay more because they are of such high quality. But again we can't get ahead of our cost of capital.\nJohn Payne: And Shaun, I'll just add to that real quick. Ed explained it well. But part of the reason why I'm out and about and meeting not only with our tenants but every operator is to continue to study the magnificent performance that these operators are delivering, so that as we do underwrite we have an understanding of what is going to remain and what may \u2013 what part of that margin may be getting back. So I'll just add that little tidbit.\nShaun Kelley: John maybe pushing a little further, since you've been in that business for 20 or 30 \u2013 20. 25 years. can you just tell us or give us your sense of some of the findings right? I think we're all trying to do the exact same thing and even some of the companies are. But just kind of \u2013 what's your maybe your gut instinct or your initial view on how sustainable some of these changes may be?\nJohn Payne: First Shaun I'm a recovering operator, right? So take what I say [indiscernible] just as an example of what is going on and the improvements that they're seeing and why it only it's good for the operator, it's good for the customer. What's happened in Las Vegas with room service at large operations room service that these big businesses lost standalone operation in its own kitchen its own staff. With COVID, what they've been able to do is not have room service but allow the consumer to order from the great restaurants that are at many of these resorts, places like Caesars Palace has Nobu and Rao's and a variety of other restaurants that now the consumer in their room can order from those restaurants. It's turning a negative business into more profitable business for the operator and it's a better experience for the consumer. Would you rather get a meal from Nobu at your room or some pancakes and bacon from room service? And so those are \u2013 there's 15, 20 other ideas that are improving the margin and they'll keep that forever. And it's also making the experience better for the consumer.\nShaun Kelley: Great color, John and I hope you hang in down there, okay.\nJohn Payne: Good, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nThomas Allen: Thank you. So earlier this year, I think the commentary was that the transaction market for gaming assets was stalled because of operators focused on kind of resuming their businesses. Now that operators have resumed their businesses and trends are going well has there been a pickup in the kind of transaction pipeline? Thank you.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I'll answer this. I'll start and then turn it over to John. Thomas, I think that what we're seeing is \u2013 well, there's two key factors in play: how well gaming has performed and recovering from the COVID crisis and this \u2013 the excitement around iGaming and sports betting. And because of those two key factors, you've got incumbent players who want to grow their store counts simply to grow their businesses and do so accretively. But also because I think Thomas, and you covered this very well, there's a bit of a land rush mentality in American gaming with the proliferation of sports betting such that people want to put more pins in the map and expose themselves to more jurisdictions for sports betting. So you've got the incumbent players who want to grow and you've got new capital that wants to come in and start to establish footprints and grow as well. And that is going to create a sense among owners of existing assets to hey, my assets are pretty liquid and they might be quite valuable right now. So I don't think it's going to be so much a case of existing operators saying, hey, I'm going to do a sale/leaseback in order to just financially engineer my own business. It's going to be potentially existing owners who go I sweated it through COVID. I'm really glad to still be alive and doing well. But maybe I actually ought to take an offer from these guys who would so love to own my casino an operator and a gaming REIT like VICI. So I think you're going to see increased liquidity based upon the excitement around the sector. And John you can talk about what you're seeing and hearing in your travel.\nJohn Payne : No. I think you described it well, and I think there's this excitement around this sector that we've not seen in years for all the reasons you talked about. Again, don't underestimate the operating business as they're putting up record numbers and margins and a lot of the other hospitality industries continue to talk about how much cash they're burning or hoping to get places open. So, it's really been I think what the operators have done.\nThomas Allen: Thank you both.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, Thomas.\nOperator: We have time for one final question. Our final question will be from John DeCree with Union Gaming. Your line is open.\nJohn DeCree: Good morning everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Just one. We've spent some time kind of talking about how your underwriting criteria for assets post-pandemic may change. But curious -- and it's only been a few months since reopened and not a ton of deal activity. But how are you seeing the OpCo or your partners change or starting to think about adapting their kind of criteria for doing a transaction with you in kind of the face of a full shutdown? Are you seeing they're -- anything that they are maybe willing to be more flexible on or things they're looking to safeguard on their end? So kind of curious on anything that you've seen so far from would-be tenants and how they kind of look at the lease and entering into a transaction that may have changed?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Good to talk to you. I'm not seeing a significant difference. I mean, we've been pretty vocal about just our underwriting and adding another lens to the way we look at deals based on what we saw during COVID. I think I've said for the past couple of quarters, the operators have a better understanding how a REIT like VICI can help them and help them grow, which I think is important. And we've spent our first three years trying to make sure they understood that and how we're a partner. So, not -- as you said, there haven't been a ton of deals. GLPI had a deal yesterday as we talked about, and we'll continue -- if there are items in the lease that make the OpCo uncomfortable and we can work with it as, I think, you've seen we want both sides to walk away from the table feeling good that they're fair deals. And we'll adjust accordingly, but we haven't gotten there yet.\nJohn DeCree: Thanks, John. Thanks everybody.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, John.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Ed Pitoniak, CEO for closing remarks.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you operator. Please let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. The number one takeaway from this call should be that the growth we produced this quarter in our revenue in our AFFO and in our dividend has been fueled by the economic power and resilience of our tenants' businesses. We are grateful, very grateful to our tenants and our tenants' customers for this resilience. We believe we're well positioned to continue growing our portfolio and driving superior shareholder value into the future. Again, thank you and good health to all. That will do it operator. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thanks, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. As we sit here today VICI is a few weeks past her third birthday. We've done a lot of work in three years and in quarter three of this year our work over the past three years truly crystallized. In Q3, 2020 we executed the following strategic growth and activities. We closed on the acquisition of three new properties. Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's New Orleans, Harrah's Laughlin. We accretively added incremental rent at our two Las Vegas properties, Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas. We provided a $400 million mortgage on the Caesars Forum Convention Center. And we made our first investment outside of gaming, with our $80 million financing of Chelsea Piers in New York, of which I'll say more in a moment. These strategic accomplishments in Q3 led to the following financial accomplishments. We grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year by 41.9%. We grew AFFO year-over-year by 38.4%. We increased our dividend by 10.9%. And not to be taken for granted, since the COVID-19 crisis began, we have collected 100% of our rent through October in cash. All told looking forward, these VICI growth activities in Q3 added annualized rent and income from loans of $288 million and a blended unlevered yield of 7.80%. Granted all American REITs haven't reported yet, but in what we've seen so far few other American REITs have posted these kinds of financial growth numbers in Q3 2020. And this growth for VICI takes place against the COVID-19 backdrop that has significantly degraded the financial results of many American REITs. And if I could just take a moment, I would note that, much of the commentary we've seen so far, we have seen VICI described as having met its expected results for Q3. And on the one hand, we're glad that we were expecting to grow in the way we have, but we hope it is not lost on anybody that the growth we did produce is truly remarkable. And this surge of growth consummated in the third quarter of 2020 comes in our third year of real estate investment management. Over this three-year period on an annualized run rate basis, we have grown our rent since emergent by 100% or $633 million, while significantly lowering our leverage from 8.5 times to the low end of our target range of between 5.0 and 5.5 times. VICI stands here today with a substantially bigger and moreover higher-quality portfolio with much lower leverage and a better laddered debt structure. And as I spoke of a moment ago, in Q3 we also made our first allocation of capital outside of gaming. Chelsea Piers is no doubt well known to those of you who live and work in New York. For anyone, who doesn't know Chelsea Piers well, this morning we uploaded to our website www.viciproperties.com a deck that summarizes the transaction and the asset. So the most valuable elements of the deck are the photos. Only photos not words can begin to do justice to the magnitude and experiential diversity of this asset. But here are a few words. Chelsea Piers is a 780,000 square foot facility on the Hudson River in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. It is New York's largest and best equipped sports and recreation facility. It offers one of New York's biggest and most dramatically situated banquet location. Finally, and very valuably, in the time of unprecedented film production activity, it offers the largest film production space in Manhattan. Roland Betts, Tom Bernstein and David Tewksbury founded Chelsea Piers in 1995. They remain in charge today. And through their 25 years of ownership and management, they have expertly and energetically steered Chelsea Piers through such past crises as 9/11, the Great Financial Crisis and Hurricane Sandy. We have confidence that under their continuing leadership, Chelsea Piers will recover strongly as the COVID-19 crisis eventually subsides and as New Yorkers once again return to New York's most spacious place to play and perform. While we're excited about our new financing partnership with Chelsea Piers, a partnership that could become longer term in nature, we remain very glad and very proud to be principally invested in American gaming real estate, a sector that has arguably performed better than any other place-based experiential sector during this COVID-19 crisis. To tell you more about how our tenants are doing and how we remain focused on gaming growth, I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Payne. John? Hey, John. John, my apologies. Your signal is breaking up quite badly. If you'd like, we could have David read your remarks. Okay. David do you want to take it from there? David? Yes, Rich, this is Ed. I think it'd be too early to make that assumption with any kind of utter certainty, but it's a relationship we've worked very hard to develop. It is a company that is expanding its footprint throughout at least the New York region. So, we're very eager as we are with all of our partners to focus on growing our relationships over the longer term. Yes, I'll start and then turn it over to John. But I think this is one of the most exciting things going on in our industry right now Rich. I know there's a lot of focus on the total addressable market, a lot of focus on what kind of revenue and profit that gaming companies will yield directly from iGaming and sports betting. And those obviously could be very important new revenue and profit providers to our tenants making our tenants an even better credit for us in the future. I think though that certainly for me one of the most powerful things going on is that technology is proving to be a tailwind right now for gaming and thus for gaming real estate. And this comes during a period where you can pretty much separate real estate asset classes into those that are benefiting from technology, obviously data centers and cell towers as two key examples or they're suffering from technology. Malls obviously being an extreme example on that side. And I think this is a case where technology is creating a tailwind for gaming and thus for the gaming REIT. And one of the most powerful elements of this tailwind is that it is helping gaming companies potentially develop their next-generation of customers. Every consumer discretionary sector has to ask the question where does our next generation of customers come from? Because being a discretionary sector is inherently up to the discretion of any given generation as to whether or not they're going to become customers. And -- if you want to put it in the simplest terms this is a powerful way to engage the [Indiscernible] generation and turn them into that next generation, which we think is enormously positive for the long-term productivity and security of our assets. But I'll turn it over to John in terms of how else we're looking at it and our willingness to get behind our tenants with incremental capital. John? John? Yes. Smedes, this is Ed. Yes, I personally have had a long-term relationship with the Chelsea Piers founders. But as a more general principle in practice what we very much intend to take advantage of at VICI is through both our management team and our Board we have lifetime's worth of engagement with other real estate -- experiential real estate asset classes. And we will use those relationships much in the way we've been able to enormously capitalize on John's unrivaled relationships in American gaming. And from the beginning we set VICI up as an experiential real estate investment trust. And we have always used as our absolute guiding premise that superior long-term returns in real estate investment management are generated through the ownership of superior real estate. So that is our greatest focus of all. Is a given piece of real estate truly superior in its marketplace and do its investment in operating characteristics promise superior longer-term returns? And Chelsea Piers ticked all those boxes and we're very confident that over time we'll continue to find opportunities like this in various experiential sectors. John? Yeah, I think \u2013 yeah, that's the great assumption, Greg. And just to be clear, the rent within the master lease might change with a new operator in either one of those two assets but our total rent would not change. And we're very confident Caesars is running the process in such a way that we're going to be very happy with whoever ends up being our new tenants in those assets. Yeah. So in a period of due diligence Greg, what we discovered is that there are various if you will entitlement and permitting issues surrounding that land that especially relate to Caesars' parking obligations. And it was not going to be easy to unwind those quickly. And given the magnitude of activity that Caesars is currently engaged in, in terms of integrating after the merger and undertaking the various activities that is we agreed that it was best for both of us. For the meantime we put that initiative aside and then perhaps return to it at a time when the dust has settled a bit post-merger. John? I was going to say, Jared, that this is a situation in which you have to triangulate off of what is by I think everyone's agreement a temporary crisis that will have an end and true long-term value. And somebody that wants to sell or needs to sell during a crisis like this has to also be mindful of long-term value in the same way that the buyer does. So it's really hard to come up with a general answer as to what kind of discount should be applied given that we're talking about real estate, and in our case we would intend to hold for decades right? And so to what degree should a temporary crisis change the enduring value of an asset, I wish I could give you a really crisp cogent answer. But it's going to end up being so highly particular in terms of any trading that would take place amidst this temporary -- emphasis on temporary uncertainty. John, I don't know, if you want to add. Hi, Barry.\nQ \u2013 Barry Jonas: Pre-COVID, we had Blackstone enter the space. We had another triple-net about to enter the gaming REIT space. Given the operating results operators are seeing now I'm curious if you expect more activity from some of those newer REITs to reemerge anytime soon? Well if they're paying attention you would sure think so Barry. I mean, again, if you look across so many real estate asset classes right now and you ask the fundamental question, how are the tenants in a variety of asset class is doing? It's very hard to identify other than maybe again data centers and cell towers examples where the tenants are doing better than ours are in terms of profitability. That is obviously very much true in the regional markets.  But I do think you're going to see as you did last week, you're going to see pleasant surprises I think even from the big strip operators in terms of how well they've done on a relative basis. So yes, there should be greatly increased interest in gaming real estate, given the way the gaming real estate has been validated through this crisis. When John and David and I and the VICI team started telling our story three years ago, we were often asked the question. Well are you guys going to need a crisis in order for people to get comfortable with the durability of this real estate and its income streams? Then we said, well we don't think we need a crisis. But well what the hell we got one. And again I think, we really cannot be more pleased with the way our tenants have performed. I think what this crisis has demonstrated Barry is that gaming real estate is not -- emphasis on not commodity real estate. In real estate categories, they are relatively commoditized. In other words, one box is like another. And if I own a coffee shop or a gym or something else and I can threaten my landlord with moving to another commodity box a block away, I have a lot of leverage over the tenant. These are not commodity boxes. These are one-of-a-kind boxes. Pretty much the definition of irreplaceable or certainly, the definition of very difficult to substitute. And that tends to be a key characteristic of non-commodity high-value institutional-quality real estate is that it is not easily substituted and that the tenants occupying that real estate operate fundamentally good businesses. And our tenants operate fundamentally great businesses. \nQ \u2013 Barry Jonas: Great. And then just curious if you looked at Tropicana Evansville or if your exposure in that stake just made it less appealing from the start? Yes. Well it's an odd situation. It was owned by a gaming REIT and it's now still owned by a gaming REIT. And I believe there was even an agreement that it could not be sold to another REIT. So it's a really good piece of real estate. I think GLPI has to be very glad they're going to continue to own it. They're going to own it with a good tenant. And we wish them the very best. And to your point Barry, we do obviously have very nice exposure already in Indiana with Southern Indiana and Hammond. And but we will be able to increase our exposure with what we think are two of the best assets in the state with the so-called Centaur assets. Yes. I'll take a first crack and then turn it over to John and David, Carlo. Would it be possible to come up with structures that would address that challenge that you rightly identified? Yes it would be possible to come up with structures and would do that. They would be complex by nature. Complex structures have a way of sometimes collapsing under the weight of their own complexity. But it definitely could be done by willing parties. There are creative ways to bridge these kinds of temporary devalue or revenue productivity issues. And we would certainly be -- as John has already talked about we are certainly able and willing to be creative in financing structures when the opportunity is right. John, David I don't know if you want to add to that? Yes I'll turn it over to David in a moment David Katz. And the loan business can be a very effective tool for REITs at giving itself exposure to sectors it may be new to and gives them an opportunity to acquire and learn in if you will a less risky way for the absolute long term. I would say we're generally going to be biased toward using loans to put ourselves in a position to eventually we would hope acquire either the underlying real estate tied to that loan or otherwise acquire real estate within that sector because we are a REIT that's being engineered to last for decades and decades and decades. Loans obviously come due they get repaid. And then if capital gets returned you've got to go find another thing to do with it. So David I don't know if you want to add to add to that, David Kieske? John, you want to take a first crack at that? Yeah. It's an interesting question, Jordan. I mean I think we're talking obviously mainly about interior space. So we would really be talking about -- we'd be talking about repurposing interior space. And in that respect, I think especially, as sports betting evolves, it will be very interesting to see the way in which the sportsbook experience evolves and changes to meet what could be increased demand. And John was in Las Vegas this week for the opening at a D. And John, maybe for the benefit of everyone who wasn't there for that, maybe you can talk about the centrality of the sportsbook, sports bar experience of that brand-new asset. And Shaun, just so we're clear when you speak of the growth that we would be underwriting you mean the growth in tenant EBITDAR? Obviously, more time adds to more confidence and more certainty. But again, I think it's just -- it just blows me away what is reported what Red Rock has reported, what Penn reported today. And these are amazing numbers. And to produce them amidst this crisis the way they have, gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in how good our tenants are right? And I think I talked about in our Q2 call Shaun, at the end of the day so much of the value of real estate ends up residing in the quality of the tenant business, right? And our tenants' businesses are getting validated. Like almost nobody else is out there outside again of like data centers and cell towers, and try buying a data center for anything less than a more than a -- I don't know 3.75% cap. So, we obviously -- we have to underwrite in relation to our cost of capital, and there's no way around that. There shouldn't be any way around that. But what we would hope to see and what we believe we will see is that as the market recognizes the quality and security of our real estate in its cash flows our cost of capital will improve commensurately and we will be potentially in a position to pay more for these assets and happily pay more because they are of such high quality. But again we can't get ahead of our cost of capital. Yes. I'll answer this. I'll start and then turn it over to John. Thomas, I think that what we're seeing is \u2013 well, there's two key factors in play: how well gaming has performed and recovering from the COVID crisis and this \u2013 the excitement around iGaming and sports betting. And because of those two key factors, you've got incumbent players who want to grow their store counts simply to grow their businesses and do so accretively. But also because I think Thomas, and you covered this very well, there's a bit of a land rush mentality in American gaming with the proliferation of sports betting such that people want to put more pins in the map and expose themselves to more jurisdictions for sports betting. So you've got the incumbent players who want to grow and you've got new capital that wants to come in and start to establish footprints and grow as well. And that is going to create a sense among owners of existing assets to hey, my assets are pretty liquid and they might be quite valuable right now. So I don't think it's going to be so much a case of existing operators saying, hey, I'm going to do a sale/leaseback in order to just financially engineer my own business. It's going to be potentially existing owners who go I sweated it through COVID. I'm really glad to still be alive and doing well. But maybe I actually ought to take an offer from these guys who would so love to own my casino an operator and a gaming REIT like VICI. So I think you're going to see increased liquidity based upon the excitement around the sector. And John you can talk about what you're seeing and hearing in your travel. Thanks, Thomas. John? Thank you, John. Yes. Thank you operator. Please let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. The number one takeaway from this call should be that the growth we produced this quarter in our revenue in our AFFO and in our dividend has been fueled by the economic power and resilience of our tenants' businesses. We are grateful, very grateful to our tenants and our tenants' customers for this resilience. We believe we're well positioned to continue growing our portfolio and driving superior shareholder value into the future. Again, thank you and good health to all. That will do it operator. Thank you."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. [Indiscernible] continuing our work to build the best company in our sector by focusing on the [Indiscernible] from accretive transactions and expanding our portfolio of the best-in-class operators. To that end [Indiscernible] Eldorado-Caesars merger originally announced in June 2019. That said [Indiscernible] Caesars for total consideration [Indiscernible]. Please do. I apologize. It must be this -- I'm in New Orleans and we have a hurricane last night. So why don't you do that Ed? I'm on, I don't know if you can hear me now. I've moved locations and tried again. Yes. I don't have much to add other than to say Rich, I think you -- over our three years you'll see we've been quite creative in working on deals and wanting to help our tenants grow. I do want to reiterate one thing -- David did a great job with my opening remarks and I apologize for being cut-off. But I did want to reiterate how proud our company is of our tenants' performance. I think sometimes it gets glossed over when many hospitality industries are talking about cash burn still. And we have operators in this space talking about record EBITDA and margins up 1,000 points. And I just want to stress that that really is incredible in the environment that we are in right now and it's a complement to the operators and how creative they've been. So Rich that's our comments on that question. I'll -- yes I'll jump in here. I think it's always interesting to watch what is on the ballots. I think Virginia is one that is going to have some opportunity. I do -- we'll see what happens in a few days. But I do think that's going to allow commercial gaming in that state and some new developments. And that could provide some opportunity for us or it could provide some opportunity for a tenant and make them continuing to be stronger. We'll have to watch Nebraska. I don't know how that is moving forward. And then to the answer to the question, we just answered about sports betting there are a number of states that are looking to move that forward and we'll see how that plays out. So -- and then obviously in Colorado, they're just kind of normalizing the casino environment by increasing debt limits, which will be good for the operators there. So all should be pretty positive. I'm watching Virginia closely though. Hey, Greg. Yes. So we have put-call on the two Indianapolis assets. David will have to remind me the exact dates when they're active. So it's not a ROFR. It's very clear. We do have a put-call on that. And we love those assets. I actually was in Indianapolis about six weeks ago at those facilities. Great business, great performance and we'll be excited. They will be added into what we're now calling our regional master lease. And David I don't know if you want to add a little bit of the details on the put-call and the timing on that? Do you want me to touch on that? Sure. Well. I was just out in Las Vegas as David said this week. So I had an opportunity to be on the strip and meet with operators throughout the whole city. So we continue to be excited about this market long term. Clearly Las Vegas has to get over not having meeting business right now and some international business, but we believe that that will come back. It really is amazing to think about the United States right now. And Las Vegas is down from its 2019 numbers, obviously, but there's still a lot of visitation going to Las Vegas. When you compare that to other U.S. cities like New York, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco there's no comparison that the consumer has not found a substitute for their travel patterns to a place like Las Vegas. So that's a long way of saying, we believe in this market. We're long-term investors. Would we do a transaction here in the short-term? I think the operators are more likely to get some more of the operations under their belt after COVID and better understand what the true run rate of EBITDA is going to be. But if you're asking do we still believe in Las Vegas, I think the answer is a resounding yes. And media reported -- you talked -- go ahead Ed. Go ahead. No. And I also think it's important we have -- if we were to ever transact the operating partner is critical. And of course most importantly, the going-in cap rate needs to be accretive. And so I assume you're asking about a large asset on the Las Vegas Strip. And like I said, we're always interested in hearing about great gaming asset strong markets like Las Vegas. No other than this -- you did a very good job Ed. I'll just add that we have the advantages of looking at real estate for the long term that hopefully over the next 30 years we look back at 2020 and it's just a blip. And so, Ed has answered your specific questions. But again I think one of the advantages we have is we're not going to be measured on what's going to happen in the business in the next month or quarter. No, it's a great question. We actually have not been asked that question, but it's something that we will consider moving forward. I thought the question was going to be leading are those revenues necessarily going to be coming back? And I think what the operators have learned and through their abilities and their analytics is that some of that revenue was -- just simply had no margin to it. And so I was going to answer it to say it's not coming back. But your question about what will we think about leases in the way we do escalators differently, I'd say we're always flexible as we create new leases, if there's a way that's fair for both sides. And if there's a way that our escalators should be different and based on some numbers, we'll think -- we could think about that differently. Good question. Yeah. The Circa asset opened on Tuesday and very focused on the Gate and the sports betting and just a wonderful new facility in Downtown Las Vegas and centered as I said around the gambler. Now, back to your first question about operators and extra space, hypothetically, if they're not going to reopen their buffet, how will they reposition that and add other amenities? That's the beauty about our tenants. And they see opportunities to improve revenues or drive a different consumer to build in. They'll change what that space is used for. And I think you're going to see that happen over the coming years as they realize they were operating restaurants or other outlets that drove revenue, but weren't driving trips and weren't driving profitability. And how do they fill that space with new amenities that do that? And one could be larger sportsbooks as Ed mentioned. Very good question. And Shaun, I'll just add to that real quick. Ed explained it well. But part of the reason why I'm out and about and meeting not only with our tenants but every operator is to continue to study the magnificent performance that these operators are delivering, so that as we do underwrite we have an understanding of what is going to remain and what may \u2013 what part of that margin may be getting back. So I'll just add that little tidbit. First Shaun I'm a recovering operator, right? So take what I say [indiscernible] just as an example of what is going on and the improvements that they're seeing and why it only it's good for the operator, it's good for the customer. What's happened in Las Vegas with room service at large operations room service that these big businesses lost standalone operation in its own kitchen its own staff. With COVID, what they've been able to do is not have room service but allow the consumer to order from the great restaurants that are at many of these resorts, places like Caesars Palace has Nobu and Rao's and a variety of other restaurants that now the consumer in their room can order from those restaurants. It's turning a negative business into more profitable business for the operator and it's a better experience for the consumer. Would you rather get a meal from Nobu at your room or some pancakes and bacon from room service? And so those are \u2013 there's 15, 20 other ideas that are improving the margin and they'll keep that forever. And it's also making the experience better for the consumer. Good, thanks. No. I think you described it well, and I think there's this excitement around this sector that we've not seen in years for all the reasons you talked about. Again, don't underestimate the operating business as they're putting up record numbers and margins and a lot of the other hospitality industries continue to talk about how much cash they're burning or hoping to get places open. So, it's really been I think what the operators have done. Yes. Good to talk to you. I'm not seeing a significant difference. I mean, we've been pretty vocal about just our underwriting and adding another lens to the way we look at deals based on what we saw during COVID. I think I've said for the past couple of quarters, the operators have a better understanding how a REIT like VICI can help them and help them grow, which I think is important. And we've spent our first three years trying to make sure they understood that and how we're a partner. So, not -- as you said, there haven't been a ton of deals. GLPI had a deal yesterday as we talked about, and we'll continue -- if there are items in the lease that make the OpCo uncomfortable and we can work with it as, I think, you've seen we want both sides to walk away from the table feeling good that they're fair deals. And we'll adjust accordingly, but we haven't gotten there yet."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Yes. Sorry about that, everybody. As John was saying and I think he broke up. To that end, as many of you know, on July 20 we completed our transformative transaction as part of the Eldorado-Caesars merger, originally announced in June 2019. We acquired Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's Laughlin and Harrah's New Orleans and modified our existing leases with Caesars for total consideration of $3.2 billion. This transaction added $253 million of incremental annual rent for VICI, strengthened the terms of our leases with Caesars and restocked our embedded growth pipeline through ROFRs on two Las Vegas strip assets, a put-call agreement on Harrah's Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand in Indianapolis and a ROFR on Horseshoe, Baltimore. Additionally in July, we agreed to fund the $18 million expansion at JACK Thistledown in exchange for incremental rent at a 10% cap rate. We also quickly and efficiently partnered with JACK Entertainment by providing them access to incremental liquidity. This demonstrates some of the benefits of having VICI as a capital partner, as we support our tenants in ways that preserve and create long-term value for all parties. Finally, as Ed highlighted during the quarter, we executed on an $80 million loan transaction with Chelsea Piers in New York City. We are very excited to announce this transaction involving an incomparable experiential asset in an incomparable city. Importantly, we believe this investment represents a meaningful partnership and potentially provides VICI a path to a longer-term relationship with Chelsea Piers, potentially adding sector and geographic diversification to our real estate portfolio over time. As we said before, we believe the transaction market within gaming is robust and will likely dwarf transactions that we may pursue outside of gaming just given the sheer magnitude and financial productivity of gaming assets. Despite over $8.2 billion of transaction activity since we started VICI three years ago, our growth story remains in the very early innings and we're excited about what is to come. You have seen us shift from defense to offense by announcing multiple transactions over the past two quarters. We always strive to do fair deals and we believe this is part of what has driven our success. We are often asked if we are going to slow down for a while, or take a break as others do. Given all the transactions we have done in a short period of time, the answer is a resounding no. You should expect us to consider participating in any fair process for an asset sale within gaming. Given our broad investment spectrum, we continue to believe that a bid that includes refinancing is likely to yield the greatest amount of proceeds for the seller of an asset and their stakeholders, giving our business the greatest prospects for growth. With respect to the operating environment, we are very proud of the way our tenants have reopened and managed our properties in the current operating environment. Despite many of the restrictions and challenges imposed on properties across the nation, our assets continue to showcase superiority relative to many other real estate sectors, as the brick-and-mortar casino experience continues to prove its durability. John has personally visited numerous assets across regional markets and was in Las Vegas earlier this week and has been quite impressed with many of the unique operational changes that the operators have done to improve and protect the guest experience, many of which have enhanced profitability. We are extremely proud to be invested primarily in gaming and we stand ready to support the growth initiatives of our tenants and other operators through fair lease terms, integrity and flexible long-term capital. I'll now touch on balance sheet and run through our financial results. Just turning to the income statement. Total GAAP revenues in Q3, '20 increased 52.6% over Q3, 2019 to $339.7 million. GAAP revenues included $26.2 million of non-cash items. Accordingly, total cash revenues in Q3, '20 were $313.5 million, an increase of 39.3% over Q3, '19. These year-over-year increases were the result of adding $88 million of rent and income from the loans during the quarter primarily as a result of closing the Eldorado transaction; the Caesars Forum mortgage; the Hard Rock Cincinnati and Century acquisitions which closed in late 2019; and the JACK Cleveland Thistledown acquisition and related loan which closed in January of 2020. AFFO was $227.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 38.4% over Q3, 2019 and AFFO per share increased 22.9% over Q3, 2019. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 15%, primarily as a result of the settlement of our June 2019 forward sale agreements in June 2020, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in advance of closing on our portion of the Eldorado-Caesars transaction. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, as flow-through was 100.3% for the quarter and margins expanded further into the high-90% range. Our G&A was $8 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was just 2.4%, which is in line with our full year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. I'd like to just highlight two items on the income statement. The first is our ongoing CECL allowance. In the third quarter, the non-cash CECL allowance was $177.1 million, which is primarily related to the new investments we made during the quarter. As a reminder, when new investments close, we record an initial CECL allowance through the P&L. Second is the $333.4 million gain upon lease modification. When we modified our leases as part of the Eldorado transaction, we were required to reassess our lease classification. And accordingly, we reclassified all of our Caesars leases to sales-type leases under ASC 842 and marked them to market resulting in a onetime gain. These items are both non-cash. As such, there is no impact to AFFO or AFFO per share. We continue to point investors to AFFO and AFFO per share, as we believe that should be the primary metric used to evaluate our financial performance and our ability to pay dividends. Just touching on the balance sheet and our capital markets activity. On September 28, we settled three million shares from the June 2020 forward sale agreement, realizing net proceeds of $63 million of cash on to our balance sheet. On September 18, we closed on the $400 million Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage with Caesars, utilizing cash on our balance sheet. And then as has been mentioned, on October 31, we closed on the $80 million mortgage with Chelsea Piers of which we funded an initial $65 million term loan with cash on our balance sheet and the remaining $15 million remains undrawn. This loan came about through a combination of a refinancing process Chelsea Piers undertook this summer, as well as a long-term relationship with the principals. The loan has an interest rate of 7%, a term of seven years and is the only loan in the cap stack of what is truly an amazing and irreplaceable asset in New York. And as we've spoken about on July 20, we closed on our portion of the Eldorado-Caesars transaction, adding $253 million of annual rent to our portfolio through the acquisition of three Harrah's assets and the acquisition of incremental rent from our Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas asset for total consideration of approximately $3.2 billion in cash. We utilized the proceeds from the settlement of the June 2019 forward sale agreements, as well as the $2 billion of proceeds from the February bond offering that were previously held in escrow to fund the transaction. Our total outstanding debt at quarter-end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.4 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of September 30, our net debt to actual LTM-adjusted EBITDA was approximately 6.5 times. This ratio is not reflective of our true leverage, as it does not include a full 12 months of income from the Eldorado transaction and therefore does not represent our true run rate leverage levels, which is well within our stated range of maintaining net leverage between five and 5.5 times. We currently have approximately $1.7 billion in available liquidity comprised of approximately $144.1 million in cash on hand, $20 million in short-term investments, $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. And then, in addition, the company has access to approximately $557 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares that are subject to the June 2020 forward sale agreement. During the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.33 based on the annualized dividend of $1.32 per share. This represented an increase in the dividend of 10.9%, one of the highest increases from any REIT during 2020. Our AFFO payout ratio for the third quarter was 76.7%, in line with our long-range target of 75%. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks Rich. There's a ground lease on -- or there's a ground lease even though it's in the river. Some of the peers are in the river with the Hudson Park Trust, but they own the peers and all the improvements and has that 28 acres 780,000 square feet. Financial metrics aren't public but it is a very, very low LTV when you think about the location and the size of the assets and the magnitude of EBITDA. This asset has a 25-year operating history. And as Ed said they've weathered 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, the Great Financial Crisis. And the revenue generators the complexity of this asset and their ability to generate consistently high EBITDA throughout the past 25 years there's been a reason that we're highly excited about this asset and excited to support Chelsea Piers. And obviously, New York was struck with COVID and some of the businesses did shut during the past few months. The majority of the businesses are reopening. The asset is generating productive EBITDA and the film studio business is blooming and going with just the global need for content. So, we're excited about this and what this may lead to in the future. Yes. Greg, I think you're asking about Southern Indiana and Hammond, but just the put-call starts in 2022 and runs till the end of 2024. But going back to Southern Indiana and Hammond, you're right, Caesars was required -- as part of the Eldorado, Caesars was required as part of the merger to sell three OpCos Evansville, Southern Indiana and Hammond. We own the real estate on Southern Indiana and Hammond. Those are processes that Caesars is running. We're not involved in those processes. If there is a sale of the OpCo, I think your question was around how does the rent change into the master lease, our total rent would not change but what it would create the opportunity for is tenant diversification for us. So we'll see how that will ultimately play out and how the bid processes work with what Caesars is required to do from Indiana. Jared, it's David. Thanks for the question. The resounding yes, it would be helpful, right? The cost of capital would be reduced. The access to capital would be significantly increased. I think the investment-grade bond volume this year is 4 times is a high-yield volume which is having a record year. But for us it's really just getting rid of the term loan. The term loan is secured by all but one of our assets and that's prohibiting us for having a traditional REIT unencumbered asset pool. And that's the catalyst, so to speak that the agency is looking forward to -- which would allow for the flip into investment grade. We give GLPI a lot of credit for getting there and highlighting that tenant concentration in of itself is not a gating item. We have similar rent from Caesars that they have from Penn. So there is a path. And again it's just the repayment that term loan, which we'll work to do over the coming months and years here. Yes. No Ed, I think you covered it well. And David Katz I like the perfect pitch, the corporate path to long-term ownership, there will likely be some small percentage of our total investment base that we can utilize in the REIT structure to deploy capital in very safe, low LTV scenarios that may lead to a path of estate ownership over the long term. So that's something we're excited about and excited about continuing to use our capital accretively."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that today's conference is being recorded today, July 30, 2020. I would now like to turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel of VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2020 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, intend, project or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our second quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Here's what remains foremost for us at this time. We continue to hope that all our stakeholders are weathering this COVID-19 crisis as best as can be. We held our last earnings call on Thursday, May 1. In my opening remarks, I focused on what because of COVID-19 we did not know with any certainty at the time; we did not know when our assets would reopen, what the recovery pace of our tenants\u2019 businesses would be; when exactly our $3.2 billion transaction with Eldorado Caesars would close; finally, when VICI would be able to return to an offensive portfolio growth strategy. Here today, July 30, we now know four key facts. Number one, virtually all of our assets have reopened. Number two, our operators have seen strong operating recovery at our regional assets, and through the end of June, we're seeing improving results at our two Las Vegas assets. Number three, the Eldorado-Caesars merger closed in July 20 and our $3.2 billion portion of that overall transaction will produce annual incremental rent of $253 million at a 7.8% cap rate, while also replenishing VICI's embedded growth pipeline. Number four, we returned to offence and continued our opportunistic growth on June 15 when we announced our intention to provide a $400 million mortgage loan on the brand new Caesars Forum Convention Center and purchased 23 more acres of strip proximate land, giving us a total land assemblage of 50 strip proximate acres, giving VICI the only large scale opportunity to deepen the Las Vegas strip at its center and to participate in the potential for long-term growth that this land represents. It all added up to another quarter that validated VICI\u2019s business model and generated market leading growth. For second quarter 2020, and in July, VICI collected 100% of cash rent from all of our tenants, which very few American REITs were able to do in Q2. This contributed to VICI achieving 20.4% growth and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, which we believe will be among the various \u2013 very highest EBITDA growth rate among all American REITs for the quarter. In a moment, John Payne will discuss our operators performance and the benefits of the Caesars merger in more depth, and David Kieske will give you details about our own financial performance. But let me take a moment to speak of the root causes of our Q2 2020 performance. We believe VICI was able to continue collecting 100% of rent, delivered 20.4% EBITDA growth and opportunistically go back on offense in Q2 2020 because fundamentally we have high quality tenants. For any rent collecting multi-tenanted REIT, the strength of the REIT\u2019s business model is the aggregated strength of its tenants\u2019 business models. All of our tenants at this time are gaming operators. And during Q2, gaming operators generally, and our five gaming operators specifically, mainly Caesars, Penn National, Hard Rock, Century Casinos and JACK Entertainment showed the strength, liquidity, durability and agility of their business models. As most of you know, I've spent time and have experience in a number of leisure, recreational and hospitality sectors, both as an operator and as a real estate investment manager. In coming to gaming real estate, as I did in 2017, I've come into a sector where the operators are I strongly believe the most dynamic and success driven operators in global leisure and hospitality. Over the course of this COVID-19 crisis, our five operators have shown just how skilled, energetic, decisive and driven they are. Here's what they have shown over the last few months; quick and effective action to shore up their liquidity; quick and effective action to minimize costs and cash burn rates during the period of closure; quick and effective action to be ready to reopen safely once given the green light; finally, quick and effective action to restore revenue and EBITDA when many other leisure sectors haven't even reopened yet. What we're also seeing is that our operators\u2019 businesses are key factors to the health of their local economies and to their state and local treasuries. As long as our operators can operate safely, their states and cities want them open for everyone's benefit. At VICI, we're sober, very sober in fact, about the fact that the COVID-19 crisis is not over. We cannot rule out the resurgence of the virus could depress demand for, or potentially lead to reclosures of casinos. But in what we've seen so far for our gaming tenants and for VICI, this crisis may ultimately provide strong proof of the strength and quality of the gaming REIT business model, which is built in turn on the strength and quality of our tenants\u2019 businesses. To hear more about our tenants, I'll now turn the call over to our President and COO, John Payne. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. The second quarter of 2020 was another very productive quarter for VICI. Over the past several months, we've worked jointly with our tenants, including Caesars, Century Casino and JACK Entertainment to provide limited short-term relief with respect to certain non-rent related requirements under our leases. As we said in the past, we will work to provide short-term solutions for our partners as needed based on each individual operator\u2019s unique circumstances. Accordingly, during this quarter, we've announced agreements to modify certain near-term capital expenditure requirements for Caesars and Century. Additionally, as noted in more detailed in our earnings press release, during the second quarter, we partnered with JACK Entertainment and agreed to fund a gaming expansion at Thistledown Racino, yielding more rent for VICI commencing in April 2022 at an attractive 10% cap rate, while also modifying our existing loan facility to provide certain temporary covenant relief and to add an additional five years to the initial lease term, as well as increasing the principle on the existing term loan and providing revolver facility to JACK. These agreements in short-term modifications help ensure that the operators we partner with are able to focus intently on reopening and operating their business through the current pandemic, while also protecting the integrity of our lease agreements and preserving long-term value for our stakeholders. As many of you have likely seen by now, the reopening of casino properties throughout the United States has been met with very robust consumer demand. Property across the regional landscapes have experienced healthy volumes. And in many cases, profitability is exceeding pre-COVID and prior year levels. We view this as a testament to the resilience, durability and longevity of the brick and mortar casino experience. While destination and fly-to markets may take longer to recover we remain believers in markets such as Las Vegas, which has proven over value proposition over a decade. As real estate investors, we think about investing in assets and markets over long periods of time. And believe the geographic exposure we have engineered with approximately 70% of rent coming from drive-to regional markets and the remaining 30% from the Las Vegas Strip represents a good balance for VICI and our shareholders during this time. Over the past, nearly three years, since we started VICI we have communicated our firm belief in the attractiveness of gaming as a real estate asset class. We believe the gaming industry through early reopening results is showcasing superiority to many other real estate sectors. While the gaming industry is unique and at times complex, we are fortunate as real estate investors to have decades of gaming experience within our management team, which greatly benefits us as we continue to navigate the pandemic and ultimately focus on investing for the long-term and growing VICI through accretive transactions. In terms of acquisitions and the outlook for growth on June 15, we announced a planned $400 million mortgage loan transaction with Caesars, which will be secured by the Caesars Forum Convention Center in Las Vegas. This structure allows VICI to benefit from $30.8 million of incremental annual income upon closing, while providing flexibility for the asset to ramp before ultimately converting to an OpCo/PropCo structure accelerating our call option from 2027 to 2025. Simultaneous with the mortgage transaction, we announced the intended purchase of approximately 23 acres of land from Caesars at a very attractive valuation of $4.5 million per acre. This land sits adjacent to the center of gravity of the Las Vegas Strip surrounded by assets that have proven their financial viability over the decades. And combined with our existing 27 acres along the same corridor gives us approximately 50 contiguous acres. Over time, we will seek to partner with third-parties for the development of that land with the goal of continuing our market beating growth well into the future. And finally, 10 days ago on July 20, we completed our transformative transaction as part of the Eldorado Caesars merger. We acquired Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City, Harrah\u2019s Laughlin and Harrah\u2019s New Orleans, and modified our existing leases with Caesars for total consideration of $3.2 billion. This transaction adds $253 million of incremental annual rent for VICI, it strengthen the terms of our leases with Caesars and restocks our embedded growth pipeline through ROFRs on two Las Vegas Strip assets, our put/call agreement on Harrah\u2019s Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand in Indianapolis and a ROFR on Horseshoe, Baltimore. In addition to this robust and unmatched embedded pipeline of opportunities, we continue to maintain a very active dialogue with our operators across gaming and other sectors, and believe our broad investment spectrum will continue to yield consistent, accretive growth for VICI\u2019s stockholders. Now I'll turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results and balance sheet. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. I'll touch briefly on our financial results for the second quarter and then move to our balance sheet and liquidity. Before I discuss the quarter, let me just acknowledge and express my sincere gratitude to our team across accounting, asset management, finance and legal for all their efforts closing the quarter remotely during this pandemic. While at the same time we are closing a $3.2 billion transaction. We at VICI are lucky to have such a cohesive team. For the quarter total GAAP revenues in Q2 2020 increased 16.8% over Q2 2019 $257.9 million, while total cash revenues in Q2 2020 were $261 million, an increase of 19.5% over Q2 2019. The year-over-year increases were the result of adding $44.4 million of rent during the quarter from the Greektown, Hard Rock Cincinnati and the Century acquisitions which closed in 2019. And the JACK Cleveland, Thistledown acquisition and related loan which closed on January 24, 2020. AFFO was $176.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 12.4% over Q2 2019, while our weighted average diluted share count increased approximately 18.5% as a result of our June 2019 equity offering and settlement of the June, 2019 forward sale agreements which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in advance of closing on our portion of the Eldorado Caesars transaction. AFFO for the quarter was also negatively impacted by approximately 23 million of negative interest expense carry related to the February bond offering for the Eldorado transaction being held in escrow for the entire quarter and approximately $3 million less in interest income on a year-over-year basis due to the decline in interest rates. Our G&A was $7.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.9% for the quarter, which is in line with our full-year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Our results, once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was 99.2% for the quarter. As you may recall, beginning in January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL, Current Estimated Credit Losses a new accounting standard which requires us to estimate and record a non-cash provision or allowance for future credit losses related to all existing and any future investments in direct financing and sales type leases in similar assets. CECL is applicable to VICI as we account for our investments as finance leases, which are subject to the accounting standard as opposed to operating leases like our gaming REIT peers, which are scoped out of the standard. In the second quarter, then non-cash allowance related to CECL was a reversal of $65.3 million from the allowance for Q1 2020, which drove a $0.13 increase in net income per share. I'd like to again, make the point that this is a non-cash allowance and as such there is no impact to AFFO or AFFO per share. We continue to point investors to AFFO and AFFO per share as we believe that should be the primary metric used to evaluate our financial performance and our ability to pay dividends. Turning to our balance sheet and capital markets activities, on June 2, 2020, we settled in full the June, 2019 forward sale agreements utilizing net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion of cash onto our balance sheet. In June 19, in connection with the announcement of the pending Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage and acquisition of the approximately 23 acres of land completed an upsize primary fall on operating of 29.9 million shares of common stock at a offering price at $22.15 per share for gross proceeds of $662.3 million through a forward sale agreement. The proceeds remain subject to settlement pursuant to the terms of the forward sale agreement. And then John had mentioned, on July 20, 2020 we closed on our portion of the Eldorado Caesars transaction adding $253 million of annual rent to our portfolio through the acquisition of three Harrah\u2019s assets and the acquisition of incremental rents from our Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas assets for total consideration of $3.2 billion in cash. We utilized the proceeds from the settlement of the June, 2019 forward sale agreements as well as the $2 billion of proceeds from the February bond offerings that were previously in escrow to fund the transaction. Following this we have approximately $400 million of cash on hand. Our total debt outstanding at quarter end was 6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.6 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of June 30, our net debt-to-LTM EBITDA was approximately 3.4 times below our stated range and focus of maintaining net leverage between 5 times and 5.5 times. This does include the impact of the June 2, forward settlement and restricted cash that\u2019s set in escrow as of June 30. We currently have approximately $1.4 billion in available liquidity comprise of the approximately $400 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility which is undrawn. In addition, the company has access to approximately $630 million in net proceeds from the future settlement of the 29.9 million shares that are subject to the forward sale agreement entered into on June 19. During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.2975 per share based on the annualized dividend of $1.19 per share. Our AFFO payout ratio for the second quarter was 83%, slightly above our long-term range of 75% as a result of the June, 2019 equity offering. With that Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, everybody. Thanks guys for your comments. Good to hear from you, and thanks for taking my questions. For starters, maybe this one\u2019s kind of best for John. John, as things have evolved coming out of obviously the pandemic disclosure period, et cetera, as you look ahead at drawing from kind of your deep industry knowledge and whatnot, I think it would be fair or at least from my perspective, would be fair to say that we do likely see some contraction of the go forward in terms of trends that we\u2019re seeing right now. In the event that, that happens, and we do start to see a little bit of that the macro economic impact of the pandemic and kind of trends, do you believe in this new interest rate paradigm and where we are right now, and kind of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of debt issuances from some operators coming in at meaningfully higher than what we\u2019ve seen previously spreads, that there will be a flow of kind of new opportunities as kind of the trading multiple versus the cost of capital dynamic has shrunk materially in favor of promoting more transaction activity?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it\u2019s a very good question. Again, I think it\u2019s important to remember because we moved so fast that just back in April, the focus of these operators was really about getting open, right, and ensuring liquidity. We now are sitting here in July and it\u2019s about staying open. And I think to your point, Carlo, you\u2019re asking about, now are they starting to think strategically and are there going to be opportunities for us. What I would tell you is from our perspective, and I think I\u2019ve communicated this, not only we\u2019ve been working with our five current tenants throughout this pandemic, I\u2019ve stayed active with really almost every operator in the gaming industry, understanding their position, how their business doing, what they\u2019re seeing from their consumers and letting them know due to our positioning that David and Ed had put us in with ample liquidity that should there be an opportunity for us to transact with them, to help them grow their portfolio or provide liquidity or do a sale lease back that we\u2019re available and when we\u2019d like to talk to them. That doesn\u2019t really answer your question about predicting the future, but what I would tell you, it\u2019s our job to make sure that if there are transactions that at least we\u2019re in the mix, and people understand that we\u2019re moving from, as Ed said earlier in his remarks, from being completely on the defensive to back as we\u2019ve shown over the past weeks, back on the offensive side of the ball a little bit here. But Ed should also \u2013 Ed and David should also weigh in on that question.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Carlo, you have rightly identified the fact that for a lot of operators in gaming, as frankly, across every major and hospitality sector, the cost of capital has gone up meaningfully in the last few months, both the cost of debt capital as you\u2019ve cited, but also the cost of equity capital. And as I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about before, we actually see the capital we provide through a sale leaseback. And in fact, being another form of equity, it is permanent capital. The recipient of it does not have to pay us back. And the cost of the capital we give them as simply the rent they pay us. So if you look at rent as expressed as a cap rate, it is generally much lower than their cost of equity currently and probably for a while yet. And to your point, it is becoming competitive with their cost of debt. So based on that, and also based on the fact that I think we\u2019re already starting to see operators, especially regional operators, who want to grow their store count, those who do want to grow their store count are very focused on partnering with REITs in order to win the bid because it will otherwise be very hard for an operator who wants to grow store count to win the bidding if they have to bid against an OpCo/PropCo bidding combination.\nCarlo Santarelli: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you both. And David, if I just could, one quick one, I think if you kind of look at fourth quarter run rate EBITDA relative to kind of your current net debt levels, et cetera, you guys would probably be looking at leverage of around five times, which certainly does provide a little bit of cushion in a lower rate environment for you guys to go out and potentially take on some leverage. Could you kind of comment a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about the capital structure here moving forward in terms of the hypothetical potential transaction?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Carlo. Good to talk to you. You\u2019re right. We\u2019ll be just kind of sub five times on a pro forma run rate basis for everything we\u2019ve announced. As we talked about what\u2019s the equity raise in June, we\u2019ll likely match funds that equity with debt at some point in the future, which gives us $1.2-odd billion of total volume power if you go out and think about raising $600 million, $700 million of high yield here at some point in the future. So on an ultimate leverage neutral basis with the balance sheet, we\u2019ve got the functionality, the flexibility, and obviously the capital markets are going to do some backdrop right now for that.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thanks, guys. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Baird.\nRJ Milligan: Hey, good morning, guys. Ed, you mentioned restocking the pipeline, especially, the captive pipeline with the closing of Eldorado and Caesars. Just curious on your thoughts on timing of executing on any of those growth opportunities.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I\u2019ll turn it over to John here momentarily, RJ, but I mean there\u2019s no question that Eldorado was what we now call, should now call Caesars, the new Caesars was greatly helped by the financing activities they undertook in mid-June, simultaneous with the announcement of our convention center mortgage and land purchase. So they obviously put themselves in a better position than the market at large had anticipated post-merger. And when it comes to the timing of anything we might do with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Look, I \u2013 it\u2019s hard to, as I\u2019ve said before, exactly predict the timing. But as our embedded growth plan has ended or the ROFRs on the Las Vegas strip, we obviously talked quite a bit about our put call opportunity on the two assets in Indianapolis and then a ROFR Horseshoe Baltimore. So as Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker takeover Caesars, they\u2019ll continue to see where there\u2019s opportunities. We like all of those opportunities. I think you\u2019ve heard them talk about having enough supply in Las Vegas and potentially selling one or two assets there. As I said in my opening remarks, we\u2019re big believers in the long-term of Las Vegas. Las Vegas obviously has some short-term issues. They\u2019re going to have to deal with the decrease in flights, the loss of international business and the decrease the of convention business. But we really are big believers in that city for the long-term, based on consumer behavior, and absolutely the number of segments that people can be attracted. So we\u2019ll just have to see what plays out with the embedded pipeline, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re sitting back and waiting just for the embedded pipeline to determine our growth of our company. As I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve been quite active making sure people know, understanding what\u2019s going on with operators and spending time and talking to them. So we\u2019ll see how it plays out in the coming months.\nRJ Milligan: Thanks. And do you anticipate doing more unique transactions, similar to the one that we saw with the convention center, if you\u2019re not happy with where your cost of capital is?\nEd Pitoniak: I don\u2019t think RJ so much. It will be a function of whether or not we\u2019re happy with our cost of capital, I think it\u2019ll be more a function of the organic situation of what we\u2019re looking at, how much clarity and certainty there is around income production at the moment and how much clarity and confidence there is around forecasting the income production in the near to midterm. So again, I think those will be the key elements, it will drive the structuring decisions that we make. David, I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that.\nDavid Kieske: No, I was going to say the same point. It\u2019s not necessarily related to the cost of capital. It\u2019s a myriad of factors that go into it. And obviously with the mortgage, it was \u2013 as we talked about kind of a synthetic bridge to long-term real estate ownership.\nRJ Milligan: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, RJ.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with SunTrust Robinson.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to start off asking how should we think about any regulatory risks around your ability to exercise the put call agreements for the two Caesars racetracks in Indiana? And if for some reason regulators had any issues, would you get access to a comparable asset or assets within Caesars portfolio instead? Thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: John, you want to start on that?\nJohn Payne: Yes, I\u2019ll start. I mean, I think that like any transaction, there\u2019s always \u2013 you always have to get regulatory approval. So the comment that the racing condition of Indiana would need to approve a sale leaseback of the two Indianapolis assets, not surprising to me at all, having been in the industry for too many years, 20-plus years, every acquisition we\u2019ve ever done is \u2013 had those stipulations that we need to go through a process. We need to spend time with the racing commission to let them understand who we are. So not a concern about the language that\u2019s out there right now. Maybe Sam or Danny, you want to answer the second part on the potential substitution? Should there be an issue?\nSamantha Gallagher: Sure, John. This is Samantha. The arrangement that John said does not have substitute assets. But as John mentioned, I think those comments surrounding the put call was not surprising and is actually no different than prior comments when we had a ROFR, prior ROFR from those assets. So we intend to work with the regulators of the period of time or the put call. In exercise, we want to make sure they can get comfortable with our REIT structure.\nBarry Jonas: Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then I guess, Caesars is \u2013 new Caesars is talking about selling, I believe, operations at three of your assets now. Just curious, can you remind us that they would need your consent to sell those operations?\nEd Pitoniak: John, Samantha?\nJohn Payne: Yes. So if you\u2019re talking about two assets in Indiana, and then I think what\u2019s the third you\u2019re referring to just so I answered the question, but the answer is yes.\nBarry Jonas: Yes. Got it.\nJohn Payne: Yes. So, yes, both those assets in Indiana that been referred to the Southern Indiana and Hammond would meet our consent if they currently sit inside the master lease and we\u2019ve really liked the real estate of those two assets.\nBarry Jonas: Understood. Then just a quick one, you\u2019ve agreed to various CapEx waivers for your operators. Given the strength we\u2019re seeing in regional markets now top line, but more so margin, do you think those waivers are still needed?\nJohn Payne: I think when we negotiated these waivers with a few of our tenants, it was absolutely appropriate. We \u2013 the properties are doing well right now, and we\u2019re excited about that, but I think we\u2019re pretty cautious. And as Ed said in his opening remarks, we\u2019re pretty realistic about that the pandemic is not over. We hope the business continue to perform well. We expect them at this time do that, but again, I think those relief packages at the time we negotiate were absolutely appropriate for us and for our tenant.\nBarry Jonas: Great. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of the Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to go back to the convention center for a moment. You talked about just having some clarity on income production. And I was just wondering, can you talk about your views on income production at that center? What\u2019s kind of the book of business look like? And I assume it\u2019s all sort of been pushed out a little bit. And how do you anticipate financing that loan? Will it be with cash on hand? Will you use equity? Maybe you could talk about that a little bit.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. So on the book of business needs, prior to the outbreak of the crisis, Caesars had actually built up a very strong book of business for the convention center. And obviously to your point, conventions that were scheduled for the assets in 2020 had largely been postponed or canceled within 2020. And you would have to \u2013 we would have to all hear from Caesars, which we\u2019ll be doing obviously shortly as to how things are looking for 2021 and beyond. In terms of our financing of the mortgage, I\u2019ll turn it over to David because that was obviously the main focus of our equity raise back in June. David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Ed. Smedes, it\u2019s good to speak to you. As we \u2013 when we announced the deal on June 15, we obviously simultaneously announced the equity offering, which resulted in an upsized equity offering and gross proceeds about $660-odd million. As we talked about in connection with that, there\u2019s an efficiency to raising capital over equitizing. And as I mentioned earlier, we will match fund that to ultimately run our balance sheet on a leverage neutral basis. So as we think about funding that mortgage, we\u2019ve got cash on hand about $400 million as we sit here today, and then we have access to that forward, which really doesn\u2019t have an end date on it. So we\u2019ll likely fund that with a mix of cash. And some of that forward here as that closes probably third quarter and then ultimately go to the debt markets at some point in the future to match fund that on a leverage neutral basis.\nSmedes Rose: Would you expect this acquisition then to be accretive to earnings?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, we would. I mean, the 7.7% cap rate and on a leverage neutral basis, it is accretive to earnings.\nSmedes Rose: Great, thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you, do you have any color on when the Greektown Casino might reopen?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: We got word yesterday that the state of Michigan is going to allow the Detroit casinos to open in August. I think it was August 5 or 6. So Penn will come out, I\u2019m sure relatively shortly here and give an exact date, but the news came out to me yesterday that that will happen in the state of Michigan.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Okay. Thank you, guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Smedes.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John G. DeCree with Union Gaming.\nJohn DeCree: Hey, guys. How\u2019s you\u2019re doing?\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, John. Good to hear from you.\nJohn DeCree: Good. Wanted to ask a question about the land that you\u2019ve purchased in your land bank in Las Vegas and spent quite enough time on that. So I believe parcels or your initial parcel is a part of the lease with your existing tenant, maybe not the part you\u2019ve just bought, but the existing part. And I was wondering if you could talk about any restrictions that you might have on that? Or how the relationship would work if you wanted to develop it or if your partner wanted to develop it? And what are some of your options on those parcels?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. So I\u2019ll start John, and then Samantha can jump in and correct me if I get anything wrong. You\u2019re absolutely right. The land that we already own, the 27 acres we already owned, were subject to the Caesars lease and Caesars have the right to use that land within our overall leisure arrangement with Caesars. With our purchase of the 23 acres we did not already own, we\u2019ve also built an agreement that will become part of this formal agreement once we execute on the transaction in fall, whereby Caesars will be able to continue to occupy the land until we have a use for it. And they will in turn for occupying the land, cover the cost of that land in regard to things like real estate tax, insurance and security. In terms of our overall vision for the land, we see this as a way of capitalizing on what we still very strongly believe to be the long-term growth of Las Vegas. The long-term growth of Las Vegas is tourist destination. And frankly also the long-term growth of Las Vegas as a global city in its entirety. And we see that land as giving us a chance to participate again, not only in the growth of Las Vegas tourism, but in the growth of Las Vegas as a place where people choose to work and to live as well as to play. And this land gives us an opportunity to do what we most love doing, which is growing our business by growing our relationships. We are not a developer. We will not take on development risk, if not what REITs generally do. And what we will do is partner with great developers, great providers of development capital, who should get rewarded for development risk in order to realize the highest and best use of this land over time. And what does land ultimately does is provide part of the answer to the question where does VICI\u2019s growth come 5 to 10 years from now? Because again, over that kind of timeframe, we are still raging bulls on Las Vegas.\nJohn DeCree: A quick follow-up on that. If you were to find a partner away from Caesars today, would there be any restrictions on what the land could be used for? I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s entitled for gaming. Maybe a better question for John, but would we expect it to be, maybe it\u2019s too soon at this point, complimentary to the building that your tenant owns nearby? Or could you potentially do hotel casino there as well that may be competitive?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, it\u2019s way too early to tell, John. Way too early. I mean, what I would say is, whenever you develop, you want it to be complimentary to what\u2019s around you because that tends to be the way you realize the greatest amount of traffic and the greatest amount of overall attraction for the destination.\nJohn DeCree: Got it. Thanks, Ed. That\u2019s all for me. Appreciate it guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities.\nTodd Stender: Hi, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered regarding the land parcels. But I would suspect you\u2019ll see some earnings drag, I guess. If you\u2019re combining the mortgage with the land parcel, yes, I get the impression that Caesars will cover some of the operating expenses, but maybe just not cash flow producing real estate. How do you think about funding that with this equity, but having maybe some earnings drag going forward?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Todd, it\u2019s really on the $100 million or $103 million of incremental capital that we have to invest to acquire the approximately 23 acres at the right point in time when we ultimately decide what we do with the land, as Ed\u2019s talked about, the right partnership and the right long-term vision, the other 27 acres would come out of the lease. And then at that time, there might be some drag, but obviously that\u2019s very, very early days and how that ultimately plays out VICI determined. But if you think about $100 million on our total balance sheet, very, very de minimis minor drag given that asset start to producing nature of that asset mix.\nEd Pitoniak: Especially when looked at, Todd, as a leverage neutral, i.e., not $103 million of equity.\nTodd Stender: Got it. Okay. And timing, I think I got the impression, this is a late to Q3. And if that\u2019s the case, is that forward equity? Maybe that\u2019s the timing around maybe seeing some of that be settled?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. We\u2019re working on. As you know, we talked about it with everybody, we announced that on a letter of intent and working through documentation and diligence now as we speak. So sometimes mid to late third quarters when we\u2019d expect that to close. And you\u2019re right, that\u2019s probably when we would ultimately use some of that forward \u2013 settle a portion of that forward agreement.\nTodd Stender: All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.\nJared Shojaian: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Now that the Creasers deal has closed, your payout ratio on go-forward AFFO is well below your historical target. Can you just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the dividends right here? And should we assume that September is kind of your typical time period for when you reevaluate it?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Jared, thanks for joining and thanks for your work this quarter. Yes, we adhered to an annual increase in our dividend. We bumped it in Q3 of 2018, we bumped it in Q3 of 2019. We don\u2019t bump our dividends mid-year or at the closing of transactions. So we\u2019ve got time before we make any decisions around the September declaration and ultimately October payout. We work closely with our board and assess where we are in terms of our liquidity, where we are in terms of state of the pandemic and COVID, obviously where our tenants business are and the outlook going forward. So our payout ratio is a little bit high right now just because of the non-income earning shares that we\u2019ve had on our balance sheet since the June, 2019 offering. But we\u2019re going to approach the third quarter with cautious. And as Ed talked about, we\u2019re silver, where we are in the world. So we\u2019ll evaluate it with the board and make the right decision to be in a position to ensure that we never put VICI out there as a REIT that has to cut their dividend or change \u2013 use of dividend going forward.\nJared Shojaian: Okay. Thank you, David. And then just a separate question, love to get your thoughts and opinion on this. Do you think we could see a reevaluation of regional gaming assets as this crisis has probably shown the world that regional assets are a lot more stable than many people might've realized? And then on the flip side obviously, I know you sound pretty bullish on Las Vegas, but how are you thinking about the revaluation or devaluation potential of Vegas here multi-year perspective?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I'll speak initially from a real estate perspective Jared and then John can jump in. But starting with Las Vegas, I do not think over the long-term it should change the way in which Las Vegas gaming real estate is valued. We obviously saw institutional investor have the caliber of Blackstone come in and validate Las Vegas real estate. They obviously are investing in long-term. They are long-term believers in the value of Las Vegas real estate we are. This is a temporary crisis that will eventually come to an end. We do not think this crisis generates secular negatives for Las Vegas. We do think Las Vegas can and will come roaring back for a whole host of reasons. But to your first point, regional, yes, you are absolutely right. This should really validate regional gaming as a real estate asset class as well as obviously an operating business given that it is far outperforming, just about any other leisure hospitality sector you can possibly identify. And it is not \u2013 it was not under secular threat coming into this year, it was posting very positive results as a sector in January and February. It is showing itself again very well here, and going forward you're not looking at the kind of overhang of secular negatives you are seeing in other categories like movie theaters where, Universal has said, yes, okay, after 17 days we will start streaming a movie. So again we think this is very validating the regional gaming. But I'll turn it over to John who has obviously operated so many of the assets that we own in the regions and can verify just how integral they are to the lives of regional customers. John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, not much to add here other than I have a smile on my face as someone who's spent almost 20 years of his career operating these regional assets, it's nice to see that the world is starting to understand how durable they are, the loyalty from their consumers. As you probably heard me say I mean, these are people, social clubs or country clubs or this is where people go to have their entertainment. It's where their friends are and you can see even during this worst pandemic that we've ever seen in our lifetime that as the businesses open up, they've been quite successful. So it's nice to see and I agree with that. And it is common, especially when you look at these assets compared to restaurants and movies, theaters, and a variety of other areas that are struggling where these assets that they've been open up have done quite well.\nJared Shojaian: Great. Thank you very much for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey good morning.\nEd Pitoniak: Hi, Greg.\nGreg McGinniss:\n2019 to Q2:\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I think we need the benefit of time, Greg. We are still as a nation and as a national economy we're still in a period of great uncertainty \u2013 uncertainty and lack of clarity. And when you have uncertainty and lack of clarity it pretty much leads to not being able to be bullish and confident in forecasting, anything. So to return to guidance at this point, we believe would be fundamentally premature. David, I'll turn it over to you to see if you have any added thoughts.\nDavid Kieske: No. Yes, the other thing Greg is I think we've talked to you about, I would say our business is pretty transparent, pretty predictable, especially now that Eldorado deal is closed and the noise out of that speak is now flowing through on a run rate. When we pulled \u2013 we pulled guidance, part of the reason was also CECL, there's new noise in the non-cash implications of CECL. We will have a charge in the third quarter around related to closing of the Eldorado transaction and bringing those three new assets on their balance sheet. So it's hard to exactly predict that and pinpoint that. So we'll assess guidance probably returning to calendar into 2021 the next point in time.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. And then just a quick two-parter on the Caesars agreements with state regulators. So first is what level of additional financial commitment is now required to Caesars. And how do you think about that burden versus rent POU? And secondly, are there any other demands that we should be aware of the impact of the business such as the sale of the casino operations?\nEd Pitoniak: I think we're started, Greg, everything with all of the principle requirements and obligations have been obviously publicly announced that is the way the regulators do business. And in terms of the additional financial partners that you're referring, for example in the CapEx requirements in New Jersey obviously those will benefit the assets and their performance as in the expansion Caesars enjoyed as we believe they will have incremental return on incremental capital.\nGreg McGinniss: I agree. Thank you very much.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Hightower with Evercore.\nRichard Hightower: Hey, good morning everybody.\nEd Pitoniak: Hey, Rich.\nRichard Hightower: I hope everybody's doing well. So a couple of ones, here so just with respect to the incremental term loan and revolver to JACK Entertainment, I know that the initial term loan tranche had a five year term, are there any prepayment features that we should know about there? And if \u2013 given that it's 9% secured paper and potentially JACK might have other options for that capital or another source of capital that's maybe a little bit cheaper. How should we think about that dynamic between VICI and JACK? And then what would you do to sort of replace the income before the end of the five years, if it came to that?\nJohn Payne: Yes. If there is a prepayment feature after 18 months, I believe anything correct me if I'm wrong. But given is a small amount, 50 million not $70 million, we've looked for opportunities to reinvest that, but this is a kind of a win-win and it's consistent with our approach where helping our liquids \u2013 helping our tenants shore up some of their liquidity at a point in time when nothing was open and as you\u2019ve seen in Ohio, the assets are doing extremely well.\nRichard Hightower: Okay. Go ahead sorry.\nSamantha Gallagher: And Rich, were they to repay the loan, we certainly do not lack for confidence in our ability to redeploy that returned capital accretively. Obviously, led by John Payne, Business Development, who works for VICI over the last two and a half years with over $8 billion of transaction. We are always confident that if there are compelling opportunities out there, we're going to source them and execute on them best we can.\nRichard Hightower: It is a staggering amount of work that you guys have all done. So I agree with that. And my second question is, maybe a twist on the valuation question from earlier, but just looking at stock performance in multiples across the net lease in REIT space, Ed, where do you think VICI and your closest peers are with respect to that incremental cap rate compression relative to some of the more traditional retail focused net lease names given the collections are all across the board, but some are quite low and you guys are sitting at 100%, where do we think we are in that evolution?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I think we're on a positive upslope, Rich. We were obviously not there yet. And I think part of the explanation for not being there yet for not having closed the gap quickly is, that these things do take time and I'm not sure frankly how much fundamental analysis and evaluation is going on right now anyway. But to your implicit point, yes I do think the broad investment community, the dedicated REITs, the income seeking generalist investors are going to recognize and are \u2013 again to your point starting to recognize the game REITs, all three of us are posting very good rent collections results. But moreover our tenants are showing themselves to be performing very strongly and that I do believe to your point deserves ultimately reserves relating. It leads to parity and not arguably to some measure premium given how we performed. And again given this as well Rich that this crisis is really showing the stress and strain of any sector that we\u2019re beginning to show signs of secular threat. Whether it be the secular threat as represented by e-commerce, the secular threat is represented by things like streaming media. Gaming is really well integrated as a place-based destination experience in the lives of millions of Americans. And we think that ultimately adds-up to very high quality real estate.\nRichard Hightower: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: HI, good morning. So I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about how the tenants businesses that held-in well through the end of June maybe for John what are you hearing on the latest kind of operations since COVID cases picked up?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Good to talk to you, Thomas. I've not heard much of a change in the business. I have heard some occupancy levels going up in some jurisdictions, but regionally the business continues to be strong based on the conversations that I've been having. Again, I think as they continue to add some more amenities back to the facilities as when the restrictions are lifted you're going to see the business continue to perform.\nThomas Allen: Okay. That echoes what Boyd said earlier this week. And then just as my follow-up on how are you thinking about the multiple paid or the returns you're looking for when you're funding capital improvements versus the entire real estate of a property? Thank you.\nEd Pitoniak: David, you want to take that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, that's a good question Thomas. And then with the JACK capital that we just funded, obviously we are earning 10% return but that's partly because we're not \u2013 the incomes are coming in until April of 2022, so even though it's $18 million very small amount for VICI but it's a factor of return, but it's out in the future. It goes part and parcel of what it is, it is expansion of a ballroom, is it really income enhancing, income producing where the overall asset is going to be significantly improved, which would lower the risk of the asset and maybe warrant for a higher price? Or is it, I have the specific examples but it\u2019s in and around probably playing higher than where we've been acquiring assets just giving us an incremental add-on to an asset, but each situation, each cap rate is obviously dependent upon the unique facts and circumstances of the situation.\nThomas Allen: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.\nJohn Massocca: Good morning.\nEd Pitoniak: Good morning, John.\nJohn Massocca: So I know you've almost talked largely about the pipeline, but maybe as we think about underwriting an appropriate valuation for Las Vegas Strip assets, do you think you would need to see a couple of quarters of post-pandemic performance in the market, where you're comfortable in underwriting any transaction or you didn't give the long-term nature of your leases, you just underwrite to almost kind of pre-pandemic performance levels?\nEd Pitoniak: I am going to turning it over John Payne here in a moment. John will talk about that, I would just say when it comes to growth, we never attach to any kind of words that have anything with business to our growth, but head-to-head. I will hand it over to you John Payne.\nJohn Payne: It's hard to follow that. Look things to Las Vegas. I mean again, I think we've been consistent and I've been very loud about this, that we really are long-term investors. Yes, in short-term Vegas has some hurdles that they need to get over, but this is a city that even during this time and even with the restrictions that are on it consumers are going to enjoy what they have to offer. And we believe over the time 2022, 2023 and moving on this business is going to rebound. As it pertains to underwriting an asset, now that's exactly what we're spending time on is what is the appropriate level to do that? What is the appropriate cap rate? But we'll have to continue to study the business as to your point we'll have to consider and see what the next couple months are like in the quarters and then determine the EBITDA that we use to underwrite as well as the cap rate. But again, I can't stress enough, you heard a lot about the short-term of Las Vegas, but we talk a lot more about the long-term in this, how resilient this city has been and how resilient the operators are to continue to reinvent themselves and be successful with the properties that they have.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. And then may be switching gears a little bit, given the strength of kind of regional operations, should we expect or potentially could we see any more of these modifications going forward? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but the only leases that are kind of as is versus pre-pandemic are Hard Rock and the Penn leases?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. I mean, I can't predict what's going to happen. I think we've been, as we've said a couple of times, we've been sober about that. We are still in the middle of a pandemic, the operations that have open and almost all of our operations have opened other than Michigan, which will open here shortly have been quite successful, in fact exceeding some of their 2019 numbers. So we're just going to have to wait and see if we continue on this path, the business are going to be strong and there won't need to be any concessions, but we'll just have to monitor what happens in the United States, but we feel obviously much better here in July than we did back in early May.\nJohn Massocca: Good. That's it for me. Thank you all very much.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Katz: Hello. Can you hear me, okay?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, how are you doing, David?\nDavid Katz: Sorry. I know you've covered quite a bit of detail. I appreciate that. I just wanted to talk about the CapEx waivers that are in place and how you're thinking about those versus a terminology that would be more like defer? And whether there could be sort of catch-ups down the road and the interest of preserving real estate\u2019s value by making sure it's properly invested?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I think David, one of the key principles that we believe in is that ultimately our operators are the beneficiary of capital well-spent and they bear the first pain when capital is not spent. I think the self-reinforcing positive qualities of this business model as opposed to say the hotel business model where a third-party manager dictates capital that they all may or may not get a return on. We much prefer this model, because at the end of the day the operator is responsible for the capital, but it's also again the beneficiary of capital well-spent and is the one first harmed, when it is not spend in terms of loss competitiveness, revenue, and profit. So we believe in this model and the ability of this model to prevent assets deteriorating in a way as you rightly pointed out they can when capital is not spent over the long-term, it didn't needs to be spent.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Thank you very much. That\u2019s it from me.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, everyone. Just in under the wire I suppose, just one question for me, John in your prepared remarks you said or mentioned a sort of 70-30 mix between the regional portfolio and the Vegas portfolio. The undertone has been here throughout the call, but just kind of curious to say it out loud, is this an appropriate mixture of VICI going forward or how do you think about that 70-30 split kind of strategically, obviously you'll underwrite acquisitions as they come? But is that a target ratio that investors should think about there's a comfort level for management, especially after everything we've seen from a performance perspective through COVID or just how do you think about that?\nJohn Payne: Yes. I don't think we've ever talked about necessarily a target. I think what we've talked a lot about is we like the diversification that we are really the only REIT in this space that has positioned itself to invest in destination resorts in Las Vegas also as well as the local business in Las Vegas, should that come about as well as every market in the region with all different types of operators. So I think our philosophy has been, we want to remain diverse. We want to continue to grow our tenant base. We started this company 2.5 years ago with one tenant now have five and I think you'll ultimately see that grow. But we today were at 70-30, we like where that is. But I don't think Shaun, you hear and say that's where absolutely has to be exactly around those numbers. We just liked the diversification than being in many different types of markets. And you can see that diversification has helped us during this pandemic.\nShaun Kelley: Thanks, everyone. Appreciate the time.\nEd Pitoniak: And Shaun, I would just add to what John has rightly said that, as a REIT we obviously want to give our investors a chance at not only income steady, predictable income, but we also want to give our investors a chance to capital appreciation as the market recognizing superior value of the assets. And over the long term and as I think again was validated by the investments Blackstone made in Las Vegas last year and early this year, we do believe that Las Vegas could give the greatest opportunity for capital appreciation, which when combined with a steady income production of regional. We think it adds up to a very compelling long-term in our both income and capital appreciation strategy.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, operator. To close out, please let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. We\u2019re proud of the results we have provided to our stock holders in this quarter and those results again our validation of both VICI\u2019s business and the businesses of our tenants. With 100% rent collection \u2013 cash rent collection in Q2, with our ability to go back on offense well before most other REITs, with the closing of our $3.2 billion transaction with Caesars and the $253 million of annual rent growth that brings, we believe we are on track to deliver one of the strongest growth rates of any REIT in America over the next year or two. Again, thank you and good health to all. Operator, that concludes the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Presenters, please remain on the line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Here's what remains foremost for us at this time. We continue to hope that all our stakeholders are weathering this COVID-19 crisis as best as can be. We held our last earnings call on Thursday, May 1. In my opening remarks, I focused on what because of COVID-19 we did not know with any certainty at the time; we did not know when our assets would reopen, what the recovery pace of our tenants' businesses would be; when exactly our $3.2 billion transaction with Eldorado Caesars would close; finally, when VICI would be able to return to an offensive portfolio growth strategy. Here today, July 30, we now know four key facts. Number one, virtually all of our assets have reopened. Number two, our operators have seen strong operating recovery at our regional assets, and through the end of June, we're seeing improving results at our two Las Vegas assets. Number three, the Eldorado-Caesars merger closed in July 20 and our $3.2 billion portion of that overall transaction will produce annual incremental rent of $253 million at a 7.8% cap rate, while also replenishing VICI's embedded growth pipeline. Number four, we returned to offence and continued our opportunistic growth on June 15 when we announced our intention to provide a $400 million mortgage loan on the brand new Caesars Forum Convention Center and purchased 23 more acres of strip proximate land, giving us a total land assemblage of 50 strip proximate acres, giving VICI the only large scale opportunity to deepen the Las Vegas strip at its center and to participate in the potential for long-term growth that this land represents. It all added up to another quarter that validated VICI's business model and generated market leading growth. For second quarter 2020, and in July, VICI collected 100% of cash rent from all of our tenants, which very few American REITs were able to do in Q2. This contributed to VICI achieving 20.4% growth and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, which we believe will be among the various \u2013 very highest EBITDA growth rate among all American REITs for the quarter. In a moment, John Payne will discuss our operators performance and the benefits of the Caesars merger in more depth, and David Kieske will give you details about our own financial performance. But let me take a moment to speak of the root causes of our Q2 2020 performance. We believe VICI was able to continue collecting 100% of rent, delivered 20.4% EBITDA growth and opportunistically go back on offense in Q2 2020 because fundamentally we have high quality tenants. For any rent collecting multi-tenanted REIT, the strength of the REIT's business model is the aggregated strength of its tenants' business models. All of our tenants at this time are gaming operators. And during Q2, gaming operators generally, and our five gaming operators specifically, mainly Caesars, Penn National, Hard Rock, Century Casinos and JACK Entertainment showed the strength, liquidity, durability and agility of their business models. As most of you know, I've spent time and have experience in a number of leisure, recreational and hospitality sectors, both as an operator and as a real estate investment manager. In coming to gaming real estate, as I did in 2017, I've come into a sector where the operators are I strongly believe the most dynamic and success driven operators in global leisure and hospitality. Over the course of this COVID-19 crisis, our five operators have shown just how skilled, energetic, decisive and driven they are. Here's what they have shown over the last few months; quick and effective action to shore up their liquidity; quick and effective action to minimize costs and cash burn rates during the period of closure; quick and effective action to be ready to reopen safely once given the green light; finally, quick and effective action to restore revenue and EBITDA when many other leisure sectors haven't even reopened yet. What we're also seeing is that our operators' businesses are key factors to the health of their local economies and to their state and local treasuries. As long as our operators can operate safely, their states and cities want them open for everyone's benefit. At VICI, we're sober, very sober in fact, about the fact that the COVID-19 crisis is not over. We cannot rule out the resurgence of the virus could depress demand for, or potentially lead to reclosures of casinos. But in what we've seen so far for our gaming tenants and for VICI, this crisis may ultimately provide strong proof of the strength and quality of the gaming REIT business model, which is built in turn on the strength and quality of our tenants' businesses. To hear more about our tenants, I'll now turn the call over to our President and COO, John Payne. John? Yes. Carlo, you have rightly identified the fact that for a lot of operators in gaming, as frankly, across every major and hospitality sector, the cost of capital has gone up meaningfully in the last few months, both the cost of debt capital as you've cited, but also the cost of equity capital. And as I think you've heard us talk about before, we actually see the capital we provide through a sale leaseback. And in fact, being another form of equity, it is permanent capital. The recipient of it does not have to pay us back. And the cost of the capital we give them as simply the rent they pay us. So if you look at rent as expressed as a cap rate, it is generally much lower than their cost of equity currently and probably for a while yet. And to your point, it is becoming competitive with their cost of debt. So based on that, and also based on the fact that I think we're already starting to see operators, especially regional operators, who want to grow their store count, those who do want to grow their store count are very focused on partnering with REITs in order to win the bid because it will otherwise be very hard for an operator who wants to grow store count to win the bidding if they have to bid against an OpCo/PropCo bidding combination. Yes, I'll turn it over to John here momentarily, RJ, but I mean there's no question that Eldorado was what we now call, should now call Caesars, the new Caesars was greatly helped by the financing activities they undertook in mid-June, simultaneous with the announcement of our convention center mortgage and land purchase. So they obviously put themselves in a better position than the market at large had anticipated post-merger. And when it comes to the timing of anything we might do with that, I'll turn it over to John. I don't think RJ so much. It will be a function of whether or not we're happy with our cost of capital, I think it'll be more a function of the organic situation of what we're looking at, how much clarity and certainty there is around income production at the moment and how much clarity and confidence there is around forecasting the income production in the near to midterm. So again, I think those will be the key elements, it will drive the structuring decisions that we make. David, I don't know if you want to add to that. Thank you, RJ. John, you want to start on that? John, Samantha? Yes. So on the book of business needs, prior to the outbreak of the crisis, Caesars had actually built up a very strong book of business for the convention center. And obviously to your point, conventions that were scheduled for the assets in 2020 had largely been postponed or canceled within 2020. And you would have to \u2013 we would have to all hear from Caesars, which we'll be doing obviously shortly as to how things are looking for 2021 and beyond. In terms of our financing of the mortgage, I'll turn it over to David because that was obviously the main focus of our equity raise back in June. David? John? Thank you, Smedes. Thanks, John. Good to hear from you. Yes. So I'll start John, and then Samantha can jump in and correct me if I get anything wrong. You're absolutely right. The land that we already own, the 27 acres we already owned, were subject to the Caesars lease and Caesars have the right to use that land within our overall leisure arrangement with Caesars. With our purchase of the 23 acres we did not already own, we've also built an agreement that will become part of this formal agreement once we execute on the transaction in fall, whereby Caesars will be able to continue to occupy the land until we have a use for it. And they will in turn for occupying the land, cover the cost of that land in regard to things like real estate tax, insurance and security. In terms of our overall vision for the land, we see this as a way of capitalizing on what we still very strongly believe to be the long-term growth of Las Vegas. The long-term growth of Las Vegas is tourist destination. And frankly also the long-term growth of Las Vegas as a global city in its entirety. And we see that land as giving us a chance to participate again, not only in the growth of Las Vegas tourism, but in the growth of Las Vegas as a place where people choose to work and to live as well as to play. And this land gives us an opportunity to do what we most love doing, which is growing our business by growing our relationships. We are not a developer. We will not take on development risk, if not what REITs generally do. And what we will do is partner with great developers, great providers of development capital, who should get rewarded for development risk in order to realize the highest and best use of this land over time. And what does land ultimately does is provide part of the answer to the question where does VICI's growth come 5 to 10 years from now? Because again, over that kind of timeframe, we are still raging bulls on Las Vegas. Yes, it's way too early to tell, John. Way too early. I mean, what I would say is, whenever you develop, you want it to be complimentary to what's around you because that tends to be the way you realize the greatest amount of traffic and the greatest amount of overall attraction for the destination. Thank you, John. David? Especially when looked at, Todd, as a leverage neutral, i.e., not $103 million of equity. David? Yes, I'll speak initially from a real estate perspective Jared and then John can jump in. But starting with Las Vegas, I do not think over the long-term it should change the way in which Las Vegas gaming real estate is valued. We obviously saw institutional investor have the caliber of Blackstone come in and validate Las Vegas real estate. They obviously are investing in long-term. They are long-term believers in the value of Las Vegas real estate we are. This is a temporary crisis that will eventually come to an end. We do not think this crisis generates secular negatives for Las Vegas. We do think Las Vegas can and will come roaring back for a whole host of reasons. But to your first point, regional, yes, you are absolutely right. This should really validate regional gaming as a real estate asset class as well as obviously an operating business given that it is far outperforming, just about any other leisure hospitality sector you can possibly identify. And it is not \u2013 it was not under secular threat coming into this year, it was posting very positive results as a sector in January and February. It is showing itself again very well here, and going forward you're not looking at the kind of overhang of secular negatives you are seeing in other categories like movie theaters where, Universal has said, yes, okay, after 17 days we will start streaming a movie. So again we think this is very validating the regional gaming. But I'll turn it over to John who has obviously operated so many of the assets that we own in the regions and can verify just how integral they are to the lives of regional customers. John? Hi, Greg. Yes, I think we need the benefit of time, Greg. We are still as a nation and as a national economy we're still in a period of great uncertainty \u2013 uncertainty and lack of clarity. And when you have uncertainty and lack of clarity it pretty much leads to not being able to be bullish and confident in forecasting, anything. So to return to guidance at this point, we believe would be fundamentally premature. David, I'll turn it over to you to see if you have any added thoughts. I think we're started, Greg, everything with all of the principle requirements and obligations have been obviously publicly announced that is the way the regulators do business. And in terms of the additional financial partners that you're referring, for example in the CapEx requirements in New Jersey obviously those will benefit the assets and their performance as in the expansion Caesars enjoyed as we believe they will have incremental return on incremental capital. Thanks Greg. Hey, Rich. Yes, I think we're on a positive upslope, Rich. We were obviously not there yet. And I think part of the explanation for not being there yet for not having closed the gap quickly is, that these things do take time and I'm not sure frankly how much fundamental analysis and evaluation is going on right now anyway. But to your implicit point, yes I do think the broad investment community, the dedicated REITs, the income seeking generalist investors are going to recognize and are \u2013 again to your point starting to recognize the game REITs, all three of us are posting very good rent collections results. But moreover our tenants are showing themselves to be performing very strongly and that I do believe to your point deserves ultimately reserves relating. It leads to parity and not arguably to some measure premium given how we performed. And again given this as well Rich that this crisis is really showing the stress and strain of any sector that we're beginning to show signs of secular threat. Whether it be the secular threat as represented by e-commerce, the secular threat is represented by things like streaming media. Gaming is really well integrated as a place-based destination experience in the lives of millions of Americans. And we think that ultimately adds-up to very high quality real estate. David, you want to take that? Good morning, John. I am going to turning it over John Payne here in a moment. John will talk about that, I would just say when it comes to growth, we never attach to any kind of words that have anything with business to our growth, but head-to-head. I will hand it over to you John Payne. John? Thanks John. David? Yes, how are you doing, David? Yes. I think David, one of the key principles that we believe in is that ultimately our operators are the beneficiary of capital well-spent and they bear the first pain when capital is not spent. I think the self-reinforcing positive qualities of this business model as opposed to say the hotel business model where a third-party manager dictates capital that they all may or may not get a return on. We much prefer this model, because at the end of the day the operator is responsible for the capital, but it's also again the beneficiary of capital well-spent and is the one first harmed, when it is not spend in terms of loss competitiveness, revenue, and profit. So we believe in this model and the ability of this model to prevent assets deteriorating in a way as you rightly pointed out they can when capital is not spent over the long-term, it didn't needs to be spent. Thank you, David. And Shaun, I would just add to what John has rightly said that, as a REIT we obviously want to give our investors a chance at not only income steady, predictable income, but we also want to give our investors a chance to capital appreciation as the market recognizing superior value of the assets. And over the long term and as I think again was validated by the investments Blackstone made in Las Vegas last year and early this year, we do believe that Las Vegas could give the greatest opportunity for capital appreciation, which when combined with a steady income production of regional. We think it adds up to a very compelling long-term in our both income and capital appreciation strategy. Thank you, operator. To close out, please let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. We're proud of the results we have provided to our stock holders in this quarter and those results again our validation of both VICI's business and the businesses of our tenants. With 100% rent collection \u2013 cash rent collection in Q2, with our ability to go back on offense well before most other REITs, with the closing of our $3.2 billion transaction with Caesars and the $253 million of annual rent growth that brings, we believe we are on track to deliver one of the strongest growth rates of any REIT in America over the next year or two. Again, thank you and good health to all. Operator, that concludes the call."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. The second quarter of 2020 was another very productive quarter for VICI. Over the past several months, we've worked jointly with our tenants, including Caesars, Century Casino and JACK Entertainment to provide limited short-term relief with respect to certain non-rent related requirements under our leases. As we said in the past, we will work to provide short-term solutions for our partners as needed based on each individual operator's unique circumstances. Accordingly, during this quarter, we've announced agreements to modify certain near-term capital expenditure requirements for Caesars and Century. Additionally, as noted in more detailed in our earnings press release, during the second quarter, we partnered with JACK Entertainment and agreed to fund a gaming expansion at Thistledown Racino, yielding more rent for VICI commencing in April 2022 at an attractive 10% cap rate, while also modifying our existing loan facility to provide certain temporary covenant relief and to add an additional five years to the initial lease term, as well as increasing the principle on the existing term loan and providing revolver facility to JACK. These agreements in short-term modifications help ensure that the operators we partner with are able to focus intently on reopening and operating their business through the current pandemic, while also protecting the integrity of our lease agreements and preserving long-term value for our stakeholders. As many of you have likely seen by now, the reopening of casino properties throughout the United States has been met with very robust consumer demand. Property across the regional landscapes have experienced healthy volumes. And in many cases, profitability is exceeding pre-COVID and prior year levels. We view this as a testament to the resilience, durability and longevity of the brick and mortar casino experience. While destination and fly-to markets may take longer to recover we remain believers in markets such as Las Vegas, which has proven over value proposition over a decade. As real estate investors, we think about investing in assets and markets over long periods of time. And believe the geographic exposure we have engineered with approximately 70% of rent coming from drive-to regional markets and the remaining 30% from the Las Vegas Strip represents a good balance for VICI and our shareholders during this time. Over the past, nearly three years, since we started VICI we have communicated our firm belief in the attractiveness of gaming as a real estate asset class. We believe the gaming industry through early reopening results is showcasing superiority to many other real estate sectors. While the gaming industry is unique and at times complex, we are fortunate as real estate investors to have decades of gaming experience within our management team, which greatly benefits us as we continue to navigate the pandemic and ultimately focus on investing for the long-term and growing VICI through accretive transactions. In terms of acquisitions and the outlook for growth on June 15, we announced a planned $400 million mortgage loan transaction with Caesars, which will be secured by the Caesars Forum Convention Center in Las Vegas. This structure allows VICI to benefit from $30.8 million of incremental annual income upon closing, while providing flexibility for the asset to ramp before ultimately converting to an OpCo/PropCo structure accelerating our call option from 2027 to 2025. Simultaneous with the mortgage transaction, we announced the intended purchase of approximately 23 acres of land from Caesars at a very attractive valuation of $4.5 million per acre. This land sits adjacent to the center of gravity of the Las Vegas Strip surrounded by assets that have proven their financial viability over the decades. And combined with our existing 27 acres along the same corridor gives us approximately 50 contiguous acres. Over time, we will seek to partner with third-parties for the development of that land with the goal of continuing our market beating growth well into the future. And finally, 10 days ago on July 20, we completed our transformative transaction as part of the Eldorado Caesars merger. We acquired Harrah's Atlantic City, Harrah's Laughlin and Harrah's New Orleans, and modified our existing leases with Caesars for total consideration of $3.2 billion. This transaction adds $253 million of incremental annual rent for VICI, it strengthen the terms of our leases with Caesars and restocks our embedded growth pipeline through ROFRs on two Las Vegas Strip assets, our put/call agreement on Harrah's Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand in Indianapolis and a ROFR on Horseshoe, Baltimore. In addition to this robust and unmatched embedded pipeline of opportunities, we continue to maintain a very active dialogue with our operators across gaming and other sectors, and believe our broad investment spectrum will continue to yield consistent, accretive growth for VICI's stockholders. Now I'll turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results and balance sheet. David? Yes, it's a very good question. Again, I think it's important to remember because we moved so fast that just back in April, the focus of these operators was really about getting open, right, and ensuring liquidity. We now are sitting here in July and it's about staying open. And I think to your point, Carlo, you're asking about, now are they starting to think strategically and are there going to be opportunities for us. What I would tell you is from our perspective, and I think I've communicated this, not only we've been working with our five current tenants throughout this pandemic, I've stayed active with really almost every operator in the gaming industry, understanding their position, how their business doing, what they're seeing from their consumers and letting them know due to our positioning that David and Ed had put us in with ample liquidity that should there be an opportunity for us to transact with them, to help them grow their portfolio or provide liquidity or do a sale lease back that we're available and when we'd like to talk to them. That doesn't really answer your question about predicting the future, but what I would tell you, it's our job to make sure that if there are transactions that at least we're in the mix, and people understand that we're moving from, as Ed said earlier in his remarks, from being completely on the defensive to back as we've shown over the past weeks, back on the offensive side of the ball a little bit here. But Ed should also \u2013 Ed and David should also weigh in on that question. Yes. Look, I \u2013 it's hard to, as I've said before, exactly predict the timing. But as our embedded growth plan has ended or the ROFRs on the Las Vegas strip, we obviously talked quite a bit about our put call opportunity on the two assets in Indianapolis and then a ROFR Horseshoe Baltimore. So as Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker takeover Caesars, they'll continue to see where there's opportunities. We like all of those opportunities. I think you've heard them talk about having enough supply in Las Vegas and potentially selling one or two assets there. As I said in my opening remarks, we're big believers in the long-term of Las Vegas. Las Vegas obviously has some short-term issues. They're going to have to deal with the decrease in flights, the loss of international business and the decrease the of convention business. But we really are big believers in that city for the long-term, based on consumer behavior, and absolutely the number of segments that people can be attracted. So we'll just have to see what plays out with the embedded pipeline, but that doesn't mean we're sitting back and waiting just for the embedded pipeline to determine our growth of our company. As I've said, I've been quite active making sure people know, understanding what's going on with operators and spending time and talking to them. So we'll see how it plays out in the coming months. Yes, I'll start. I mean, I think that like any transaction, there's always \u2013 you always have to get regulatory approval. So the comment that the racing condition of Indiana would need to approve a sale leaseback of the two Indianapolis assets, not surprising to me at all, having been in the industry for too many years, 20-plus years, every acquisition we've ever done is \u2013 had those stipulations that we need to go through a process. We need to spend time with the racing commission to let them understand who we are. So not a concern about the language that's out there right now. Maybe Sam or Danny, you want to answer the second part on the potential substitution? Should there be an issue? Yes. So if you're talking about two assets in Indiana, and then I think what's the third you're referring to just so I answered the question, but the answer is yes. Yes. So, yes, both those assets in Indiana that been referred to the Southern Indiana and Hammond would meet our consent if they currently sit inside the master lease and we've really liked the real estate of those two assets. I think when we negotiated these waivers with a few of our tenants, it was absolutely appropriate. We \u2013 the properties are doing well right now, and we're excited about that, but I think we're pretty cautious. And as Ed said in his opening remarks, we're pretty realistic about that the pandemic is not over. We hope the business continue to perform well. We expect them at this time do that, but again, I think those relief packages at the time we negotiate were absolutely appropriate for us and for our tenant. We got word yesterday that the state of Michigan is going to allow the Detroit casinos to open in August. I think it was August 5 or 6. So Penn will come out, I'm sure relatively shortly here and give an exact date, but the news came out to me yesterday that that will happen in the state of Michigan. Yes, not much to add here other than I have a smile on my face as someone who's spent almost 20 years of his career operating these regional assets, it's nice to see that the world is starting to understand how durable they are, the loyalty from their consumers. As you probably heard me say I mean, these are people, social clubs or country clubs or this is where people go to have their entertainment. It's where their friends are and you can see even during this worst pandemic that we've ever seen in our lifetime that as the businesses open up, they've been quite successful. So it's nice to see and I agree with that. And it is common, especially when you look at these assets compared to restaurants and movies, theaters, and a variety of other areas that are struggling where these assets that they've been open up have done quite well. Yes. If there is a prepayment feature after 18 months, I believe anything correct me if I'm wrong. But given is a small amount, 50 million not $70 million, we've looked for opportunities to reinvest that, but this is a kind of a win-win and it's consistent with our approach where helping our liquids \u2013 helping our tenants shore up some of their liquidity at a point in time when nothing was open and as you've seen in Ohio, the assets are doing extremely well. Yes. Good to talk to you, Thomas. I've not heard much of a change in the business. I have heard some occupancy levels going up in some jurisdictions, but regionally the business continues to be strong based on the conversations that I've been having. Again, I think as they continue to add some more amenities back to the facilities as when the restrictions are lifted you're going to see the business continue to perform. It's hard to follow that. Look things to Las Vegas. I mean again, I think we've been consistent and I've been very loud about this, that we really are long-term investors. Yes, in short-term Vegas has some hurdles that they need to get over, but this is a city that even during this time and even with the restrictions that are on it consumers are going to enjoy what they have to offer. And we believe over the time 2022, 2023 and moving on this business is going to rebound. As it pertains to underwriting an asset, now that's exactly what we're spending time on is what is the appropriate level to do that? What is the appropriate cap rate? But we'll have to continue to study the business as to your point we'll have to consider and see what the next couple months are like in the quarters and then determine the EBITDA that we use to underwrite as well as the cap rate. But again, I can't stress enough, you heard a lot about the short-term of Las Vegas, but we talk a lot more about the long-term in this, how resilient this city has been and how resilient the operators are to continue to reinvent themselves and be successful with the properties that they have. Yes. I mean, I can't predict what's going to happen. I think we've been, as we've said a couple of times, we've been sober about that. We are still in the middle of a pandemic, the operations that have open and almost all of our operations have opened other than Michigan, which will open here shortly have been quite successful, in fact exceeding some of their 2019 numbers. So we're just going to have to wait and see if we continue on this path, the business are going to be strong and there won't need to be any concessions, but we'll just have to monitor what happens in the United States, but we feel obviously much better here in July than we did back in early May. Yes. I don't think we've ever talked about necessarily a target. I think what we've talked a lot about is we like the diversification that we are really the only REIT in this space that has positioned itself to invest in destination resorts in Las Vegas also as well as the local business in Las Vegas, should that come about as well as every market in the region with all different types of operators. So I think our philosophy has been, we want to remain diverse. We want to continue to grow our tenant base. We started this company 2.5 years ago with one tenant now have five and I think you'll ultimately see that grow. But we today were at 70-30, we like where that is. But I don't think Shaun, you hear and say that's where absolutely has to be exactly around those numbers. We just liked the diversification than being in many different types of markets. And you can see that diversification has helped us during this pandemic."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. I'll touch briefly on our financial results for the second quarter and then move to our balance sheet and liquidity. Before I discuss the quarter, let me just acknowledge and express my sincere gratitude to our team across accounting, asset management, finance and legal for all their efforts closing the quarter remotely during this pandemic. While at the same time we are closing a $3.2 billion transaction. We at VICI are lucky to have such a cohesive team. For the quarter total GAAP revenues in Q2 2020 increased 16.8% over Q2 2019 $257.9 million, while total cash revenues in Q2 2020 were $261 million, an increase of 19.5% over Q2 2019. The year-over-year increases were the result of adding $44.4 million of rent during the quarter from the Greektown, Hard Rock Cincinnati and the Century acquisitions which closed in 2019. And the JACK Cleveland, Thistledown acquisition and related loan which closed on January 24, 2020. AFFO was $176.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 12.4% over Q2 2019, while our weighted average diluted share count increased approximately 18.5% as a result of our June 2019 equity offering and settlement of the June, 2019 forward sale agreements which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in advance of closing on our portion of the Eldorado Caesars transaction. AFFO for the quarter was also negatively impacted by approximately 23 million of negative interest expense carry related to the February bond offering for the Eldorado transaction being held in escrow for the entire quarter and approximately $3 million less in interest income on a year-over-year basis due to the decline in interest rates. Our G&A was $7.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.9% for the quarter, which is in line with our full-year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Our results, once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was 99.2% for the quarter. As you may recall, beginning in January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL, Current Estimated Credit Losses a new accounting standard which requires us to estimate and record a non-cash provision or allowance for future credit losses related to all existing and any future investments in direct financing and sales type leases in similar assets. CECL is applicable to VICI as we account for our investments as finance leases, which are subject to the accounting standard as opposed to operating leases like our gaming REIT peers, which are scoped out of the standard. In the second quarter, then non-cash allowance related to CECL was a reversal of $65.3 million from the allowance for Q1 2020, which drove a $0.13 increase in net income per share. I'd like to again, make the point that this is a non-cash allowance and as such there is no impact to AFFO or AFFO per share. We continue to point investors to AFFO and AFFO per share as we believe that should be the primary metric used to evaluate our financial performance and our ability to pay dividends. Turning to our balance sheet and capital markets activities, on June 2, 2020, we settled in full the June, 2019 forward sale agreements utilizing net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion of cash onto our balance sheet. In June 19, in connection with the announcement of the pending Caesars Forum Convention Center mortgage and acquisition of the approximately 23 acres of land completed an upsize primary fall on operating of 29.9 million shares of common stock at a offering price at $22.15 per share for gross proceeds of $662.3 million through a forward sale agreement. The proceeds remain subject to settlement pursuant to the terms of the forward sale agreement. And then John had mentioned, on July 20, 2020 we closed on our portion of the Eldorado Caesars transaction adding $253 million of annual rent to our portfolio through the acquisition of three Harrah's assets and the acquisition of incremental rents from our Caesars Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas assets for total consideration of $3.2 billion in cash. We utilized the proceeds from the settlement of the June, 2019 forward sale agreements as well as the $2 billion of proceeds from the February bond offerings that were previously in escrow to fund the transaction. Following this we have approximately $400 million of cash on hand. Our total debt outstanding at quarter end was 6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.18%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.6 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of June 30, our net debt-to-LTM EBITDA was approximately 3.4 times below our stated range and focus of maintaining net leverage between 5 times and 5.5 times. This does include the impact of the June 2, forward settlement and restricted cash that's set in escrow as of June 30. We currently have approximately $1.4 billion in available liquidity comprise of the approximately $400 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility which is undrawn. In addition, the company has access to approximately $630 million in net proceeds from the future settlement of the 29.9 million shares that are subject to the forward sale agreement entered into on June 19. During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.2975 per share based on the annualized dividend of $1.19 per share. Our AFFO payout ratio for the second quarter was 83%, slightly above our long-term range of 75% as a result of the June, 2019 equity offering. With that Operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, Carlo. Good to talk to you. You're right. We'll be just kind of sub five times on a pro forma run rate basis for everything we've announced. As we talked about what's the equity raise in June, we'll likely match funds that equity with debt at some point in the future, which gives us $1.2-odd billion of total volume power if you go out and think about raising $600 million, $700 million of high yield here at some point in the future. So on an ultimate leverage neutral basis with the balance sheet, we've got the functionality, the flexibility, and obviously the capital markets are going to do some backdrop right now for that. No, I was going to say the same point. It's not necessarily related to the cost of capital. It's a myriad of factors that go into it. And obviously with the mortgage, it was \u2013 as we talked about kind of a synthetic bridge to long-term real estate ownership. Yes. Thanks, Ed. Smedes, it's good to speak to you. As we \u2013 when we announced the deal on June 15, we obviously simultaneously announced the equity offering, which resulted in an upsized equity offering and gross proceeds about $660-odd million. As we talked about in connection with that, there's an efficiency to raising capital over equitizing. And as I mentioned earlier, we will match fund that to ultimately run our balance sheet on a leverage neutral basis. So as we think about funding that mortgage, we've got cash on hand about $400 million as we sit here today, and then we have access to that forward, which really doesn't have an end date on it. So we'll likely fund that with a mix of cash. And some of that forward here as that closes probably third quarter and then ultimately go to the debt markets at some point in the future to match fund that on a leverage neutral basis. Yes, we would. I mean, the 7.7% cap rate and on a leverage neutral basis, it is accretive to earnings. Yes, Todd, it's really on the $100 million or $103 million of incremental capital that we have to invest to acquire the approximately 23 acres at the right point in time when we ultimately decide what we do with the land, as Ed's talked about, the right partnership and the right long-term vision, the other 27 acres would come out of the lease. And then at that time, there might be some drag, but obviously that's very, very early days and how that ultimately plays out VICI determined. But if you think about $100 million on our total balance sheet, very, very de minimis minor drag given that asset start to producing nature of that asset mix. Yes. We're working on. As you know, we talked about it with everybody, we announced that on a letter of intent and working through documentation and diligence now as we speak. So sometimes mid to late third quarters when we'd expect that to close. And you're right, that's probably when we would ultimately use some of that forward \u2013 settle a portion of that forward agreement. Yes. Jared, thanks for joining and thanks for your work this quarter. Yes, we adhered to an annual increase in our dividend. We bumped it in Q3 of 2018, we bumped it in Q3 of 2019. We don't bump our dividends mid-year or at the closing of transactions. So we've got time before we make any decisions around the September declaration and ultimately October payout. We work closely with our board and assess where we are in terms of our liquidity, where we are in terms of state of the pandemic and COVID, obviously where our tenants business are and the outlook going forward. So our payout ratio is a little bit high right now just because of the non-income earning shares that we've had on our balance sheet since the June, 2019 offering. But we're going to approach the third quarter with cautious. And as Ed talked about, we're silver, where we are in the world. So we'll evaluate it with the board and make the right decision to be in a position to ensure that we never put VICI out there as a REIT that has to cut their dividend or change \u2013 use of dividend going forward. No. Yes, the other thing Greg is I think we've talked to you about, I would say our business is pretty transparent, pretty predictable, especially now that Eldorado deal is closed and the noise out of that speak is now flowing through on a run rate. When we pulled \u2013 we pulled guidance, part of the reason was also CECL, there's new noise in the non-cash implications of CECL. We will have a charge in the third quarter around related to closing of the Eldorado transaction and bringing those three new assets on their balance sheet. So it's hard to exactly predict that and pinpoint that. So we'll assess guidance probably returning to calendar into 2021 the next point in time. Yes, that's a good question Thomas. And then with the JACK capital that we just funded, obviously we are earning 10% return but that's partly because we're not \u2013 the incomes are coming in until April of 2022, so even though it's $18 million very small amount for VICI but it's a factor of return, but it's out in the future. It goes part and parcel of what it is, it is expansion of a ballroom, is it really income enhancing, income producing where the overall asset is going to be significantly improved, which would lower the risk of the asset and maybe warrant for a higher price? Or is it, I have the specific examples but it's in and around probably playing higher than where we've been acquiring assets just giving us an incremental add-on to an asset, but each situation, each cap rate is obviously dependent upon the unique facts and circumstances of the situation."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today May 01, 2020. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties. Please go ahead.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator and good afternoon. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2019 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, expect, should, guidance, intends, projects and other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; and Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we'll open the call to questions. With that I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Here is what is foremost at this time for us and that is that we hope that all our stakeholders are weathering this crisis as best as can be hoped. Our hearts go out to any who have been stricken by this virus and to the hundreds of thousands of US gaming industry employees who have been furloughed for the past few weeks. Those stricken, we wish a speedy recovery and to those who've been furloughed, we wish for reopenings to come soon and come safely. We held our last earnings call on Thursday, February 20th and in my opening remarks I focused on the ways in which VICI's relationships have fostered the building and bettering of our REIT. I talked on that call about our relationships with gaming operators and asset controllers, our creditors, our own people and of course you, our stockholders. Today, about two months after our last earnings call, I want to talk about another critical VICI relationship and that is our relationship to reality. The essence of our relationship to reality is this, we don't deny reality, we don't fight reality. We manage our business so that we make the best we can, a reality. Reality has changed a lot since our last earnings call to the point where reality can feel sort of unreal. Here's what we know with real certainty. 28 - of 28 of our assets are closed. Here's what we do not know with any certainty. When our assets will all reopen and what the recovery pace of our tenants businesses will be. There are many different scenarios for when our assets could reopen and many different scenarios for what the recovery paid to the American Regional and Las Vegas Gaming could be. We are modeling all of those scenarios and digging deep into what the implications of each scenario could be for VICI and for our tenants. But it's too early to commit to any strategy that only works if a certain scenario prevails, because we don't know which scenario will prevail. We are working and we'll continue to work, day by day, week by week, month by month with our tenants to determine how we best mutually navigate this crisis, which may ultimately mean supporting our tenants during the short term in ways we believe will benefit us over the long term. But there is one strategy we are committed to and have in fact been committed to since day one at VICI. And that's to be prepared for heavy weather and scenarios that heavy weather may bring. The one strategy that works for most variety is heavy weather is a liquidity focused strategy, a strategy that centers on already possessing and having ready access to cash is sufficient to meet the company's fundamental financial obligations for a prolonged period of heavy weather. Our cash position is supported by the way we run our business, low G&A, high margins, high flow-through of revenue growth to profit growth, strong cash retention driven by a payout ratio at the lower end of triple net REIT standards. As our CFO, David Kieske will make clear later in this call, VICI's liquidity position today is a position we will work to preserve every day going forward. I've talked about what we know and what we don't know, the outlook for reopening and recovery. But let me close out these opening remarks by turning to what we strongly believe. We believe we own high quality, well located real estate that is and moreover will remain mission-critical to our tenants. We believe that our tenants are in a business gaming that has proven its deep and enduring consumer appeal over decades and through February 2020 American Casino traffic revenue and profit were at their highest levels in recent years. American Gaming is a consumer sector that did not come into the COVID-19 crisis with pre-existing conditions. And while we don't know what the pace of gaming recovery will be post COVID-19, we believe that there will come a time in the future when consumer demand for the gaming experience will return to prior levels. All of this is to say that because of the long term durability of gaming as a consumer experience we believe strongly in the enduring value of gaming real estate. VICI\u2019s owners, you our stockholders own this fundamentally valuable real estate and we believe strongly that the value of your real estate will endure long past, the passing of this crisis. With that, I will turn the call over to John Payne, our President and Chief Operating Officer. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. To start the first quarter of 2020 remain productive for VICI. On January 24th we closed on the acquisition of JACK Cleveland Casino and JACK Thistledown Racino and a sale leaseback transaction with JACK Entertainment. We paid a total of $843 million and added $65.9 million of annual rent to our portfolio through a master lease which represents an attractive 7.8% cap rate for urban real estate in Ohio. Just last week on April 24th, we and our tenant Caesars, announced the disposition of Valley's Atlantic City for total proceeds of $25 million. Not only will we receive approximately $19 million of the gross proceeds from the sale, but we will retain ownership of the Wild Wild West Casino area in Sportsbook, which will be folded into our Caesars asset. And importantly there will be no change to the existing annual rent under the master lease with Caesars. This transaction helps balance our geographic diversification as we work to complete the acquisition of Harrah's Atlantic City and it's just another example of how VICI works constructively with our tenants even in this current environment. Turning to our tenants and the outlook of the gaming industry. Unlike many other REITs who have hundreds of tenants, we currently benefit from only having five tenant and we continue to have active dialogue with each of our tenants during this unprecedented time. We've collected 100% of our rent in April, and with respect to the outlook for May we believe all - we believe all rent will be received this month. Many of you have asked about our diversification strategy on prior calls. Specifically as it relates to investment outside of gaming, we have been very thorough in our evaluation of other sectors and have not made an investment to date by design. We believe this measured diligent approach has benefited our investors given the current environment. While we'll continue to evaluate the investment characteristics and overall attractiveness of other sectors, we will remain intensely focused on gaming as we believe at the right time gaming will yield opportunities for VICI to continue to grow creatively. In addition to our tenants, I am spending time with other casino operators to best understand the potential reopening timelines across the industry. As Ed mentioned every commercial casino property across the United States remains closed and at this time we're not yet aware of a definitive timeline for reopening. As many of you know in normal times, the gaming industry operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week 52 weeks a year and operators have extensive experience developing, communicating and executing detailed operational plans. This energy, expertise and rigour will be key to reopening safely, successfully and profitably. We are firm believers in the resilient enduring nature of the gaming industry. The game industry has an extremely loyal customer base and has proven its resilience through challenges in prior economic cycles. As Ed noted, gaming did not suffer from any pre-existing conditions heading into this pandemic. In fact, January and February of this year were among the best months, many properties have experienced in decades and we believe customers are eager to return to our facilities, particularly at the local level upon reopening. While we do not know exactly what tomorrow brings, we believe that the importance of our assets will only increase in the months and years ahead given the mission critical nature of the asset to the operators, the revenues collected by the states from gaming tax and the total jobs the casinos create in their respective communities. We retain a strong liquidity position as David will discuss and we stand ready to support our tenants to the extent absolutely necessary in ways that create value for VICI over the long term. And lastly, with respect to the Eldorado transaction. Eldorado stated in their press release last Friday morning that they continue to remain intensely focused on closing the transaction with Caesars. We stand ready to close on our portion of the overall transaction as our financing is complete, which David will discuss. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and balance sheet.\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. Before we discuss our financial results and balance sheet, let me take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our accounting, asset management, finance and legal teams for all their efforts and relentless focus closing the quarter remotely during this pandemic, truly a remarkable effort. I'd like to point out that we added an additional schedule to the back of our earnings release, which breaks down our cash revenue by lease and the corresponding non-cash adjustments in order to tie to GAAP revenue as presented on the face of our income statement. We also disclosed this breakdown, as well as other detailed financial information in our quarterly financial supplement, which is located in the Investors section of our website under menu heading Financials. For the quarter total GAAP revenues in Q1 \u201920 increased 19.2% over Q1 \u201919 to $255 million, while total cash revenue in Q1 \u201920 was $257.6 million, an increase of 21.8% over Q1 2019. These increases were the result of adding $44.1 million of rent during the quarter from the Greektown, Hard Rock Cincinnati and the Century acquisitions which closed in 2019, and JACK Cleveland Thistle down acquisitions and related loan which closed on January 24th 2020. AFFO was $180 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the quarter. Our G&A was $7 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.8% for the quarter, which is in line with our full year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was nearly a 100%. Beginning January 1st, 2020, we adopted CECL, a new accounting standard, which required us to estimate and record a non-cash provision or allowance for future credit losses relating to all existing and any future investments in direct financing and sales type leases and similar assets. CECL is applicable to us as we account for our investments as finance leases, which are subject to the new accounting standard, as opposed to operating leases like our gaming REIT peers, which are scoped out of the standard. We have historically determined that our leases effectively have 35 year durations, given the mission criticality of the assets to our tenants. This lease duration and other factors lead to our leases being classified as finance leases for accounting purposes. The CECL allowance is derived from estimated probabilities of lease default in any resulting losses over the full life of the leases, inclusive of all extension options. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused this allowance to increase in the first quarter of 2020 to reflect the current economic environment. This resulting non-cash allowances recorded through our statement of operations impacting net income and FFO, but is excluded from the calculation of AFFO due to its non-cash nature. In the first quarter, the non-cash allowance related to CECL was $149.5 million drag on net income and a $0.32 drag on net income per share. Like to again make the point, that this is a non-cash allowance and as such there is no impact to FFO and AFFO per share. Moving on to the balance sheet and capital markets activities. On January 24, 2020, we amended our credit agreement which reduced the interest rate on our term loan B from LIBOR plus 2% to LIBOR plus 175 with a LIBOR floor of 0%. On February 5th, 2020, we closed on a $2.5 billion unsecured notes offering comprised of $750 million of five year notes at 3.5%, $750 million of seven year notes at 3.75% [ph] and a $1 billion of 10.5 year notes at 4.125%. We placed $2 billion of the net proceeds into escrow pending the consummation of the Eldorado Transaction, which amount is subject to a special mandatory redemption if the Eldorado transaction does not close. The remaining $500 million of proceeds were used to retire the 8% second lien notes which were redeemed on February 20th. On February 7th, we sold 7.5 million common shares under our at-the-market equity program for net proceeds of $200 million. Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion, inclusive of the $2 billion of unsecured notes currently held in escrow with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.9 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As the March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately five times, in our stated range in focus of maintaining net leverage between 5 and 5.5 times. This includes the impact of the restricted cash that sits in escrow. We currently have approximately $1.3 billion in liquidity comprised of approximately $310 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility which is undrawn. In addition, the company has access to approximately $1.3 billion in proceeds from the settlement of the 65 million shares that are subject to the forward sale agreements entered into in June of 2019. Between the proceeds from the equity forward agreements and the 2 billion of unsecured notes in escrow, we have three $3.2 billion of capital earmarked for the closing of the Eldorado transaction. As noted in the press release we put on April 16th, 2020, given the economic uncertainty and a rapidly evolving circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic together with the implementation of the new CEL accounting standard which significantly impacted net income, we withdrew our previously issued 2020 guidance and are not providing an updated outlook at this time. As many of you know, our guidance does not include acquisitions that have been announced but not yet closed. We believe this approach to guidance is prudent and responsible though it is typically resulted in a material difference between the range we provide and consensus estimates which do include pending acquisitions. Accordingly, we will evaluate the overall structure and usefulness of guidance going forward. Finally as it relates to the dividend, during the first quarter we paid a dividend of $0.2975, based on the annualized dividend of a dollar $19 per share, our AFFO payout ratio for the first quarter was 78%, slightly above our long range target to 75% as a result of the June 2019 equity offering. With that, operator please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Smedes Rose from Citi. Your line is open.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask you about some of the language in your more recent filings, were you in the context of your lease as you talk about ongoing dialogue with your tenants. So I'm assuming that rent deferrals or concessions are not on the table at this point. But could you talk about some of the things that you are considering or what you know, you might need to work with that month to help them through this time. And then my second question, you know, you talked about liquidity a little bit and is there a point where you would consider paying a portion or all of your dividend in stock or combination of stock and cash?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. Thanks, Smedes. Good to hear from you. John, why didn't you take the first part of the question regarding how we approach tenant discussions and then David can address the dividend funding question. John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Smedes, good morning. As I said in my opening remarks one of the advantages we do have, we have five tenants and not hundreds of tenants. So as you can imagine we are actively engaged in discussions with our tenants, not only about our leases and potential modifications, but really about their business, what they they're seeing, how they think they're going to ramp. And we've had a variety of apps from our tenants based on a variety of potential scenarios as it relates to the openings and timelines and ramps and currently right now as you know you follow the space, there's not real clarity about exactly when these assets are going to open and then there's a variety of models that we run on how they're going to ramp up. So as you can imagine the tenants are beginning to ask, some of they asks have [ph] included partial rent or relief or deferral of rent, but there are other temporary lease modifications like CapEx spend that could help our tenants preserve cash. So we're looking at this holistically, it is important to realize that we think that value needs to be traded for value and we do think that this is a temporary problem, so temporary problems need temporary solutions. And so that's how our discussions continue to go. They've been productive and hopefully we'll continue to have greater visibility in the next day or in weeks when the assets will open and then we'll get a better idea of how the assets will ultimately ramp. So Ed, I'll turn it back to you.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. David, you want to address the dividend funding question.\nDavid Kieske: Yeah, thanks Smedes. Hope you\u2019re well. As most people know or as you know, we set the payout ratio very low from day one. We've always had a targeted payout ratio of in around 75%. Obviously, we're a little bit above that given the equity offering from last June. But part of reason - part of the reason we set the payout ratio low is to be able to weather all storms and to maintain the dividend. And we're obviously in a hell of a storm right now. And so we're relentlessly focused on maintaining that dividend and as we work with our tenants we feel confident that we will be able to maintain that dividend as we sit here today. We have the liquidity to maintain that dividend. I think for me, it's part of your question was, would we consider paying some of that in stock, if needed we might evaluate that option, that would not be our first choice. But if things continue on and if we don't know what tomorrow brings, that's something we might evaluate. But at this time as we sit here today, we're very focused on maintaining that cash dividend.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Guys, obviously you know, with the deals that you did both the equity and some of the capital markets transactions in preparation for the acquisition that you guys have closed on and plan to close on, you've let yourself in a very nice liquidity - a very nice liquidity position. As you think about the balance sheet and going through these upcoming transactions, whatever it is that they closed, you'll still - it seems [ph] have a pretty good buffer of cash. And I guess my question is, is there anything that that you guys could consider in terms of maybe some creativity around how you put that cast to work in the short term, whether that is you know, cash need to potentially support some of your tenants or cash to go out and kind of looks to be a little bit more aggressive on the M&A front as one could surmise that there will be other \u2013 other assets out there that are in need of some form of capital markets help or liquidity?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Carlo, I'll start on that. And good to hear from you Carlo, hope you are well. Maybe I just want to start by actually recognizing David Kieske for his leadership on that \u2013 the bond financing we did in late January. I remember talking to David in early January going really, you really want to go that soon and he said yeah, I want to go that soon. And God bless us that we did when we did. You may have seen that Netflix which is obviously a pretty good credit these days went out to raise money last week and they still couldn't reach our benchmark on our five year. So anyway, again, thanks and thanks to David for that. In terms of how we think about use of our cash Carlo, the general approach we're taking right now and it's an approach we really dug into with our board yesterday on our Q1 board meeting, is an approach that we define as situational readiness. At this point given the uncertainty of reopening, given moreover the uncertainty of ramp back, we have to be ready strategically and economically for the broadest possible array of situations or scenarios and that array ranges from the highly, highly defensive on one end to the highly offensive on the other. And at this time we really can't pre-commit to being highly, highly defensive or highly offensive, because it's again too early to tell. But if things start to show green shoots, if we see the consumer coming back, if we see the assets reopening and producing good results, you are absolutely right, our liquidity position puts us in a position where we can make the jump into offense potentially before others because, again, thanks to David's leadership on our balance sheet, we got a totally undrawn revolver and we have that ample cash that you referred to. But at this point, what we really like about our position is it makes this situation really ready for the broadest array of situations from again be extremely defensive to the highly offensive.\nCarlo Santarelli: That's helpful. Thank you very much, Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Carlo.\nOperator: Next question will come from Rich Hightower from Evercore. Your line is open.\nRich Hightower: Good morning, guys. Trust everybody is doing well.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Thanks, Rich.\nRich Hightower: I guess, Ed just a thought - go ahead.\nEdward Pitoniak: All yours.\nRich Hightower: Okay. Just a follow up I guess on that last question, as we think about longer term, maybe with respect to the external growth prospects for this sector, to the extent that you are having you know, those sorts of discussions right now with potential sellers you know, depending on their situation, do you detect an extra sensitivity around maybe layering on the added fixed costs of at least to an operators capital structure. Do you think more equities capital structures will be the norm going forward? And then maybe as we think about how coverage ratios and everything - everything along those lines will change just in the context of greater uncertainty. Obviously no one runs a business with a zero revenue outlook. But you know, just that added level of conservatism as we think about the potential rent revenue that could be out there. Does that diminish kind of you know, in light of what's happened.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. It's a really good question, Rich. And I think the answer could be very complex and fairly variable based on that situation of each operator. I think one point you make is absolutely right. I think you could see for both operators and REITs a more conservative approach to balance sheet management and cash flow. I think in the hedge fund - after this Lexicon [ph] the term lazy balance sheet is not going to get used for a while here. I think companies will generally get rewarded for being conservative. I do think where gaming REITs could have appeal to gaming operators who are still on the critical amount of property is that we can be another form of capital. I think you can presume their equity is going to be quite expensive. Their debt has gotten more expensive, to the extent that we can provide another form of permanent capital at affordable prices. That could be appealing, especially when combined with the fact that our capital does not bring with it any kind of bullet maturity. And I think anybody right now who is facing any kind of bullet maturity is in probably a pretty high state of nausea and we are a form of capital that does not bring that kind of anxiety with it.\nRich Hightower: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And then just a quick a quick sort of modeling question. I know you've got some time before the coverage test on the Caesars leases and certain other leases, before those tests kick in. But I think on the two Penn leases those come up in year two, do you care to sort of ballpark where we are maybe with respect to getting those escalators by that time?\nEdward Pitoniak: John and David?\nDavid Kieske: Yeah, Rich. Its David. Hope you\u2019re well. The two leases you're referring to obviously Margaritaville and in Greektown. Margaritaville reset earlier this year, 1/1/20 and we got that escalator. We're coming up on your two Greektown. We closed at May of last year, so June 1 of this year will be the reset - yeah the reset, excuse me. And we are in discussions with Penn around that, unlikely that reset happens just given the performance of the asset.\nRich Hightower: Okay. Thanks, David. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Thanks for taking the question. I guess, my first is for John. I guess, given your experience as an operator, how would you generally think through cash needs to reopen some of these properties and how cash generation or breakevens might change in an environment where there's just lower occupancies due to social distancing?\nJohn Payne: Well, to remind you, I'm recovering operator, so you can only take what I said with - that I've been there. Look, I think that I've got great confidence in these operators. You know, it reminds me of the time Churchill said, never let a good crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that is, this is something that no one would ever wish upon an industry or a country. But these operators have now had a few weeks without operating business to think about how they reopen them in new ways. And I think what you're going to see is obviously there's going to be restrictions on whether that's mask or social distancing restrictions. But they're also, as those pass over time, different ways of how the companies think about operating the business. So to answer your question, I think that will in the short term when revenues aren't going to be the way they were in 2019, you're going to see some margin differences in those performances, but I think that over a long period of time you're going to see those businesses come back. And teams are laser focused, the operating teams are preserving cash, ensuring they've got the right amount of cash in the cage, not too much, not too little. And we'll just have to see again how these businesses ultimately ramp.\nStephen Grambling: And then a\u2026\nDavid Kieske: Stephen, if I could just add a little more color to that as a fellow recovering operator in this case schemed off in my case. You know, when you're an operator your two main inventory items are the utilization of space and the utilization of time. The social distancing strategies that our operators undertake, as John has spoken of, they will obviously reduce space utilization at one time. But we were talking to one of our operators the other day and it's an example of how energetically and vigorously gaming operators think about the management of their two key inventory items, space and time. That they're taking a very innovative approach to how they manage the utilization of time and have identified segments in the day where specific customer demographics will be given a specific invitation to come at a specific time of day. And thus while the overall space utilization may be somewhat lower, you could potentially get higher utilization of day parts than you had previously because of the customer's willingness to adapt their behavior in order to safely visit and enjoy the casinos. And again, I take a lot of - I take a lot of encouragement and \u2013 well, not solace. But I think a lot of encouragements on how are operators are thinking about how they're going to manage their business in that respect. We're seeing the example close to home. As you know, within our TRS we own four golf courses, two of which are going to reopen tomorrow. And in southern Indiana, our tee sheet is full for the day and we're selling tee times based on social distance practices, right up until the 4 o'clock time slot. And any of you who ever been in golf course operations know, it's usually very tough to book the 4 o'clock in the afternoon time slot and it's an example of how I think the American consumer will adapt their behavior in order to enjoy what they really want to enjoy.\nStephen Grambling: Great, thanks. And then not to beat a dead horse, but with the stock trading where it is it seems like the market or investors are expecting some kind of relatively permanent rent reduction. I guess, are you considering or how are you thinking about permanent amendments such as rent coverage floors or just an outright change in leases at this point?\nEdward Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Stephen, hope you\u2019re well. And to use a business full answer it all depends, right? It's tenant by tenant specifics and what the individual circumstances are. You know, I think you heard John say, you know, could it be a form of temporary liquidity to bridge them you know, through a period of - back to Carlos or back to the question around what what's the cage cash and what are operating needs for the couple - next couple months. You know, we do benefit from the fact that we do have liquidity, so could we buy additional assets from our tenants, could we provide some form of true liquidity versus trading an asset for rent, deferred rent. And I guess, it would - it comes down to as John said, making sure that we trade value for value. The unique aspect about the sector is that these are mission-critical assets for the tenants. And unlike the broader triple net sector, where a lot of tenants are just walking and not paying - not going to pay rent and may not ever come back, you know, given the licenses, given the importance of the assets to the tenant, to the employees, to the states and the tax revenues they generate, the tenants need to maintain these boxes and need to stay in these boxes. So you know, we will find ways to help support our tenants if needed. But you know, we're still in the early stages here as we sit here May 1st and you know, the outlook for opening is still a little bit unclear, but there's some green shoots out there.\nStephen Grambling: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next question will come from Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nTodd Stender: Thanks. Just on that theme of cash in the cage you know, obviously visibility when states will reopen, can you speak to what states - what else they can do to lower the barrier to re-entry, modify or loosen regulations? Heard about cash in that cage, but anything else that you can think of?\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yeah. I mean, I think you're thinking about this correctly. Again, we are not the operator, our tenants are, but we stay in contact and I think you're thinking about it right and that these operators are going to these states and saying look, this is unprecedented time. We don't know yet exactly the demand from our consumers when we first open up. Are there some things here that can help our liquidity position that ultimately over the next month, two months, six months, year, we'll get back to \u201cnormal operations\u201d. So I don't have the specifics. Cash is obviously one that's been. But there are other regulations that have put in place over time. Remember many of these regulations in these states were created 20, 25 years ago and made sense. I do think that there will probably be a push over time to continue to find new ways to make it more efficient for the property. So I don't have any specifics, but I'd tell you that is what the operators are doing, are pushing the states to find ways that they can have some temporary solutions to this unique situation.\nTodd Stender: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Todd.\nOperator: The next question will come from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nThomas Allen: Morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the Bally's Atlantic City transaction and how you got the results that you did?\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you. Yeah. Good to hear from you Thomas. John?\nJohn Payne: Yeah, I mean this is a discussion and when we announced it as I said on April 24th, as we continue to look at that market, as you know, Thomas we\u2019ll be acquiring as part of the Eldorado deal, Harrah's Atlantic City. We saw this unique opportunity to kind of decrease our position there. Well, at the same time the Wild Wild West casino and its sportsbook will be rolled into Caesars. So not all of the real estate or the asset is being sold and it also was a negotiation that allowed our rent out of the non-CPLV lease to remain the same. And we just saw this as a unique opportunity to make that transaction and for those reasons I thought it was good for us to do that.\nThomas Allen: I guess, you have the expectation that your tenant income will go down because of it and you wanted to get some incremental cash to defer that or how did you get to the $19 million calculation?\nJohn Payne: Splitting of the - go ahead, David.\nDavid Kieske: Yes\u2026\nJohn Payne: Go ahead, David.\nDavid Kieske: That was similar that the Reno transaction where we split the proceeds 75, 25 with Caesars that we announced at the end of - the beginning of this year. Similar proceeds split roughly 75% of the total consideration went to VICI's landlord in Caesars, as operator.\nThomas Allen: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.\nJohn Massocca: Good morning.\nEdward Pitoniak: Good morning, John.\nJohn Massocca: I know we've kind of belabor this point a little bit, but just given some of your commentary on prior questions, I mean, is it fair to categorize your view of negotiations with tenants that you would prefer some kind of asset for you - asset exchange or assets or liquidity exchange to the traditional deferral that maybe we're seeing more of in kind of the retail oriented net lease space?\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: I think yeah, I think that's the way you should think about it. I think it's important understand also for us that it's May 1st today, the clarity on when the assets are going to open is not great. Hopefully in the next week or so we'll get greater clarity. And then how these assets ultimately ramp is not real clear. I mean, you can see there's numerous scenarios run by every operator and by us. So it's important for us to continue to see how this ultimate is going to play out. But your description is exactly how we've been thinking about it is, that these are temporary issues, there needs to be temporary solutions and those temporary solutions have to have value for value trade and that's how - that's a quick way of our overview of our philosophy.\nJohn Massocca: Very helpful. And then switching gears a little bit, as you kind of enter what might be a more challenging environment for kind of Las Vegas and the Las Vegas Strip market. How does that change maybe philosophically the way you look at your Roper's there and maybe make it more attractive because you might be able to potentially get into a property at a lower basis or you know with a little more uncertainty would you potentially think about you're not executing on those if the opportunities arose?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. I'll turn over to John Payne in a moment. John, let's talk a bit. I think our starting point would be that while Vegas may indeed recover somewhat more slowly than the region over the long term we have no - there is no flagging of our conviction. It is one of the world's great destinations but John Payne, I\u2019ll turn it over to you for more color.\nJohn Payne: Yeah, I think Ed you started out answering the question perfectly. I mean we are long term investors of real estate. As you all know as David opened up by saying, we look at our leases over 35 years. This is pandemic has been just awful and unprecedented. But we do think that it is temporary. Now whether temporary is months or temporary is a year or year and a half, we'll have to wait and see that ultimately plays out. And I sure can't predict that. But it doesn't change our long term view of Las Vegas and our long term view of the very limited amount of assets that are on the strip in Las Vegas. So we still think that that is a community and a destination that over the long term will continue to perform and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities there, whether that's in the short term or in the long term. So I hope that gives you some visibility on how we're thinking about it.\nJohn Massocca: I appreciate all the color. That's it for me. Thank you guys very much.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Next question will come from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. You know, covered a lot of detail, but I wanted to just follow up on CECL and I did get on a minute or two late, so apologies if you've touched on this. But just a thinking and recognizing that it is non-cash and optical and what it represent. How could we think about what that will look like a quarter from now, two quarters now, three quarters from now on the assumption that we start to move down a road toward properties starting to open up.  You know, is this kind of the one big shot for it and what we see is an incremental from here, is that we might expect that to look?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. David Katz. Good to hear from you. I'll turn over to do David Kieske in just a moment. But let me give you my perspective as a non accountant, my perspective as an asset manager. And when CECL first came along, I will confess I went really \u2013 we go to do that, why. But what I've come to appreciate about the CECL practice if you will, is that it is I believe a valuable management tool when it comes to being situationally ready. What CECL requires us to do is first of all to look forward, which is always valuable in and of itself. And as we look forward at the credit quality, credit condition and operating performance of our tenants, the forecasted performance of our tenants, it requires us to be honest and rigorous about what the various scenarios could be. And it is a further tool in our tool kit to make a situation only ready for what may transpire in the coming period based on a reasonable and rigorous forecast. As to the volatility, the CECL could bring in coming quarters and years. I'll turn that over to David Kieske.\nDavid Kieske: Great. Thanks, Ed. And David Katz yes, as Ed said, CECL reflects the deterioration especially in Q1 in the broader economy and it's not management's expectation for any losses in the current portfolio, it is simply an accounting standard, it's a non-cash allowance. And if you look at you know, note 6 page 28, 29 of our 10 Q, we've put some good disclosure in there around how CECL evolved over the first quarter. On 1/1/2020, we had to record an initial allowance, that was 2.88% of our total investment balance. That number on a normalized - normal economic environment should answer your question David, should move around 5, 10 maybe 15 basis points a quarter. Given COVID, given the downturn, it spiked up to about 100 basis points this quarter, so that it's - the model is all identifiable inputs really around credit rating and the economic outlook of the economy. And so that's what drove the change. But once we get back to normalize run rate, you're right David, it should be much - it will be less volatile and stay within a little - more of a stated range.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Barry Jonas from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess, just at a high level, any color on how this crisis may change or say influence thoughts on how a structure deals in the future?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah, I'll give you some first thoughts. Barry, good to hear from you. I hope you're well. You know, as I said in regard to what Rich Hightower asked about you know, I do think you know this whole experience will cause all of us to expand the rigor with which we account for you know, extreme scenarios of performance or operating conditions. And so I think you know there will be a lot of focus, obviously on tenant credit quality, as there always \u2013 already was with us and coverage and various lease terms and conditions that give us and the tenant comfort that - that even in the most dire times we can each mutually survive and ultimately thrive. John and David Kieske, do you want to add anything to that.\nDavid Kieske: No I think you described it well. Ed, I think will \u2013 I have nothing to add to that.\nBarry Jonas: Great. And then I guess, just a follow up for me. Any color on golf operations. Just curious any expectations on when that business could reopen and what the ramp could look like for that particular business?\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yeah, I'll take - I'll take that. As Ed mentioned, we're opening two of our courses today and two of our courses tomorrow. And Nevada just gave the go-ahead two days ago. So we've not had a lot of pre-selling there and those will open tomorrow of course in Mississippi and our course in Indiana open today. And as Ed mentioned the tee sheets were quite full. So we'll continue to watch that. The operations like we're seeing in other hospitality areas are not full operations, meaning our clubhouses are not open our food and beverage are not open. I think we'll have some really good visibility over the next six weeks, as we're able to start marketing to consumers in our destination courses in Las Vegas. We'll obviously be more focused at the time on locals and in some of these courses like Cascata, which I'm not currently a golfer, but I know from golfers that's a bucket list course that we'll price at a fee to allow locals to come out and play. So we should see some good demand to start getting that business up and running. So to answer your specific question, I think we need a couple of weeks to better understand how it's going to ramp, but the early results at least what we're seeing in Indiana and Mississippi are quite encouraging.\nEdward Pitoniak: What I would just add is that, while obviously the economic impact of this VICI is not all that material, I think the greater meaning for us and perhaps for you as well is that the pent up demand to get out of that damn house that it so strongly exist in America right now. I mean you're seeing it manifest itself on beaches, people just want to get out and while we see data that measures public perceptions of safety and their willingness to go back out again, while we do see a high percentage of Americans rightly saying they are going to be careful in how they return to leaving home, there's a lot of people who really, really want to leave all.\nBarry Jonas: Including me. Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next question will come from Sean Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nSean Kelley: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I'm not sure who this question is best for, but I'm just kind of curious as we think about the reopening plan from the operator perspective. You know, just wondering if you guys have any thoughts about how like - you know which properties reopen by the operators could - could impact sort of the difference in coverages between sort of four wall properties and the broader corporate guarantee. So maybe just your broad view on sort of how does the corporate guarantee help you in the kind of and this type of landscape and how could that fluctuate around the portfolio or impact operator decisions? Thanks.\nEdward Pitoniak: Sure. David, you want to take that.\nDavid Kieske: Yeah. Thanks, Seam. And as Yogi Berra once said, it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future, so you know this is where we think - this is where we take comfort in the master lease and especially across the Caesars portfolio which obviously has assets all across the country, Vegas and in very, very good regional network. So we came into this you know north of three times on a corporate coverage, given the wholly owned assets in the Caesars - in the Caesars portfolio, primarily on the Vegas strip, that corporate coverage will come down and nobody really knows where you know what the ramp will be what EBITDA will be. But you know the corporate coverage is key to us and obviously we have that with Century, Penn and you know we have the individual leases with Penn where we are [indiscernible] corporate coverage and then Hard Rock is also a corporate coverage. But given the investment grade nature of that and then we feel very, very comfortable with that and we have a corporate coverage on a smaller entity with JACK, very meaningful investment where Dan Gilbert one of the owners there. So we'll have to see. It's hard it's hard to take. It's hard to predict, the coverages will come down but we don't really you know, we don't have a good sense as John talked about how this ultimately opens and ramps.\nSean Kelley: Thanks. Thanks for entertaining that David. And then my other question was just on the JACK portfolio specifically, can you just remind us of what sort of the extra collateral or what is kind of you know what may be in that corporate guarantee beyond the you know the obvious operating properties. That's it from me.\nEdward Pitoniak: David or John?\nDavid Kieske: Yeah I can do it. Sean, couldn't think of another entertain that. Look its an entity called Rock Ohio Ventures, ROV. It owns the two casinos Jack Cleveland, JACK Thistle. JACK Cleveland actually sits within the Higbee building, which is part of ROV, Rock Ohio Ventures, as a garage next door. And then some additional land right in that area. So that's part of the reason we ultimately did that loan to JACK is there's additional real estate collateral within that entity.\nSean Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: I have no further questions in queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, operator. This is Ed I hope all of you found the call to a value today and maybe even a little bit entertaining one of our owners texted me during the call and let me know he was pretty sure this was the first earnings call that invoked both Winston Churchill and Yogi Berra. So again, we hope you found the time value. And let me just close by reiterating our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. With each passing week we will learn more about what our collective recovery from COVID-19 will look like as quietly as an economy and the gaming industry and as the coming period unfold we will share along with you as we can assist you always feel you can reach out to us whenever we can be a help to you. Now you have our best wishes for good health. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.+",

            "content": "Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Here is what is foremost at this time for us and that is that we hope that all our stakeholders are weathering this crisis as best as can be hoped. Our hearts go out to any who have been stricken by this virus and to the hundreds of thousands of US gaming industry employees who have been furloughed for the past few weeks. Those stricken, we wish a speedy recovery and to those who've been furloughed, we wish for reopenings to come soon and come safely. We held our last earnings call on Thursday, February 20th and in my opening remarks I focused on the ways in which VICI's relationships have fostered the building and bettering of our REIT. I talked on that call about our relationships with gaming operators and asset controllers, our creditors, our own people and of course you, our stockholders. Today, about two months after our last earnings call, I want to talk about another critical VICI relationship and that is our relationship to reality. The essence of our relationship to reality is this, we don't deny reality, we don't fight reality. We manage our business so that we make the best we can, a reality. Reality has changed a lot since our last earnings call to the point where reality can feel sort of unreal. Here's what we know with real certainty. 28 - of 28 of our assets are closed. Here's what we do not know with any certainty. When our assets will all reopen and what the recovery pace of our tenants businesses will be. There are many different scenarios for when our assets could reopen and many different scenarios for what the recovery paid to the American Regional and Las Vegas Gaming could be. We are modeling all of those scenarios and digging deep into what the implications of each scenario could be for VICI and for our tenants. But it's too early to commit to any strategy that only works if a certain scenario prevails, because we don't know which scenario will prevail. We are working and we'll continue to work, day by day, week by week, month by month with our tenants to determine how we best mutually navigate this crisis, which may ultimately mean supporting our tenants during the short term in ways we believe will benefit us over the long term. But there is one strategy we are committed to and have in fact been committed to since day one at VICI. And that's to be prepared for heavy weather and scenarios that heavy weather may bring. The one strategy that works for most variety is heavy weather is a liquidity focused strategy, a strategy that centers on already possessing and having ready access to cash is sufficient to meet the company's fundamental financial obligations for a prolonged period of heavy weather. Our cash position is supported by the way we run our business, low G&A, high margins, high flow-through of revenue growth to profit growth, strong cash retention driven by a payout ratio at the lower end of triple net REIT standards. As our CFO, David Kieske will make clear later in this call, VICI's liquidity position today is a position we will work to preserve every day going forward. I've talked about what we know and what we don't know, the outlook for reopening and recovery. But let me close out these opening remarks by turning to what we strongly believe. We believe we own high quality, well located real estate that is and moreover will remain mission-critical to our tenants. We believe that our tenants are in a business gaming that has proven its deep and enduring consumer appeal over decades and through February 2020 American Casino traffic revenue and profit were at their highest levels in recent years. American Gaming is a consumer sector that did not come into the COVID-19 crisis with pre-existing conditions. And while we don't know what the pace of gaming recovery will be post COVID-19, we believe that there will come a time in the future when consumer demand for the gaming experience will return to prior levels. All of this is to say that because of the long term durability of gaming as a consumer experience we believe strongly in the enduring value of gaming real estate. VICI's owners, you our stockholders own this fundamentally valuable real estate and we believe strongly that the value of your real estate will endure long past, the passing of this crisis. With that, I will turn the call over to John Payne, our President and Chief Operating Officer. John? Yeah. Thanks, Smedes. Good to hear from you. John, why didn't you take the first part of the question regarding how we approach tenant discussions and then David can address the dividend funding question. John? Yeah. David, you want to address the dividend funding question. Yes. Carlo, I'll start on that. And good to hear from you Carlo, hope you are well. Maybe I just want to start by actually recognizing David Kieske for his leadership on that \u2013 the bond financing we did in late January. I remember talking to David in early January going really, you really want to go that soon and he said yeah, I want to go that soon. And God bless us that we did when we did. You may have seen that Netflix which is obviously a pretty good credit these days went out to raise money last week and they still couldn't reach our benchmark on our five year. So anyway, again, thanks and thanks to David for that. In terms of how we think about use of our cash Carlo, the general approach we're taking right now and it's an approach we really dug into with our board yesterday on our Q1 board meeting, is an approach that we define as situational readiness. At this point given the uncertainty of reopening, given moreover the uncertainty of ramp back, we have to be ready strategically and economically for the broadest possible array of situations or scenarios and that array ranges from the highly, highly defensive on one end to the highly offensive on the other. And at this time we really can't pre-commit to being highly, highly defensive or highly offensive, because it's again too early to tell. But if things start to show green shoots, if we see the consumer coming back, if we see the assets reopening and producing good results, you are absolutely right, our liquidity position puts us in a position where we can make the jump into offense potentially before others because, again, thanks to David's leadership on our balance sheet, we got a totally undrawn revolver and we have that ample cash that you referred to. But at this point, what we really like about our position is it makes this situation really ready for the broadest array of situations from again be extremely defensive to the highly offensive. Thank you, Carlo. Yes. Thanks, Rich. All yours. Yeah. It's a really good question, Rich. And I think the answer could be very complex and fairly variable based on that situation of each operator. I think one point you make is absolutely right. I think you could see for both operators and REITs a more conservative approach to balance sheet management and cash flow. I think in the hedge fund - after this Lexicon [ph] the term lazy balance sheet is not going to get used for a while here. I think companies will generally get rewarded for being conservative. I do think where gaming REITs could have appeal to gaming operators who are still on the critical amount of property is that we can be another form of capital. I think you can presume their equity is going to be quite expensive. Their debt has gotten more expensive, to the extent that we can provide another form of permanent capital at affordable prices. That could be appealing, especially when combined with the fact that our capital does not bring with it any kind of bullet maturity. And I think anybody right now who is facing any kind of bullet maturity is in probably a pretty high state of nausea and we are a form of capital that does not bring that kind of anxiety with it. John and David? David? John? Thank you, Todd. Thank you. Yeah. Good to hear from you Thomas. John? Good morning, John. John? Yeah. I'll turn over to John Payne in a moment. John, let's talk a bit. I think our starting point would be that while Vegas may indeed recover somewhat more slowly than the region over the long term we have no - there is no flagging of our conviction. It is one of the world's great destinations but John Payne, I'll turn it over to you for more color. Thanks, John. Yeah. David Katz. Good to hear from you. I'll turn over to do David Kieske in just a moment. But let me give you my perspective as a non accountant, my perspective as an asset manager. And when CECL first came along, I will confess I went really \u2013 we go to do that, why.

Sure. David, you want to take that. David or John? Thank you, operator. This is Ed I hope all of you found the call to a value today and maybe even a little bit entertaining one of our owners texted me during the call and let me know he was pretty sure this was the first earnings call that invoked both Winston Churchill and Yogi Berra.

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. To start the first quarter of 2020 remain productive for VICI. On January 24th we closed on the acquisition of JACK Cleveland Casino and JACK Thistledown Racino and a sale leaseback transaction with JACK Entertainment. We paid a total of $843 million and added $65.9 million of annual rent to our portfolio through a master lease which represents an attractive 7.8% cap rate for urban real estate in Ohio. Just last week on April 24th, we and our tenant Caesars, announced the disposition of Valley's Atlantic City for total proceeds of $25 million. Not only will we receive approximately $19 million of the gross proceeds from the sale, but we will retain ownership of the Wild Wild West Casino area in Sportsbook, which will be folded into our Caesars asset. And importantly there will be no change to the existing annual rent under the master lease with Caesars. This transaction helps balance our geographic diversification as we work to complete the acquisition of Harrah's Atlantic City and it's just another example of how VICI works constructively with our tenants even in this current environment. Turning to our tenants and the outlook of the gaming industry. Unlike many other REITs who have hundreds of tenants, we currently benefit from only having five tenant and we continue to have active dialogue with each of our tenants during this unprecedented time. We've collected 100% of our rent in April, and with respect to the outlook for May we believe all - we believe all rent will be received this month. Many of you have asked about our diversification strategy on prior calls. Specifically as it relates to investment outside of gaming, we have been very thorough in our evaluation of other sectors and have not made an investment to date by design. We believe this measured diligent approach has benefited our investors given the current environment. While we'll continue to evaluate the investment characteristics and overall attractiveness of other sectors, we will remain intensely focused on gaming as we believe at the right time gaming will yield opportunities for VICI to continue to grow creatively. In addition to our tenants, I am spending time with other casino operators to best understand the potential reopening timelines across the industry. As Ed mentioned every commercial casino property across the United States remains closed and at this time we're not yet aware of a definitive timeline for reopening. As many of you know in normal times, the gaming industry operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week 52 weeks a year and operators have extensive experience developing, communicating and executing detailed operational plans. This energy, expertise and rigour will be key to reopening safely, successfully and profitably. We are firm believers in the resilient enduring nature of the gaming industry. The game industry has an extremely loyal customer base and has proven its resilience through challenges in prior economic cycles. As Ed noted, gaming did not suffer from any pre-existing conditions heading into this pandemic. In fact, January and February of this year were among the best months, many properties have experienced in decades and we believe customers are eager to return to our facilities, particularly at the local level upon reopening. While we do not know exactly what tomorrow brings, we believe that the importance of our assets will only increase in the months and years ahead given the mission critical nature of the asset to the operators, the revenues collected by the states from gaming tax and the total jobs the casinos create in their respective communities. We retain a strong liquidity position as David will discuss and we stand ready to support our tenants to the extent absolutely necessary in ways that create value for VICI over the long term. And lastly, with respect to the Eldorado transaction. Eldorado stated in their press release last Friday morning that they continue to remain intensely focused on closing the transaction with Caesars. We stand ready to close on our portion of the overall transaction as our financing is complete, which David will discuss. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and balance sheet. Yes. Smedes, good morning. As I said in my opening remarks one of the advantages we do have, we have five tenants and not hundreds of tenants. So as you can imagine we are actively engaged in discussions with our tenants, not only about our leases and potential modifications, but really about their business, what they they're seeing, how they think they're going to ramp. And we've had a variety of apps from our tenants based on a variety of potential scenarios as it relates to the openings and timelines and ramps and currently right now as you know you follow the space, there's not real clarity about exactly when these assets are going to open and then there's a variety of models that we run on how they're going to ramp up. So as you can imagine the tenants are beginning to ask, some of they asks have [ph] included partial rent or relief or deferral of rent, but there are other temporary lease modifications like CapEx spend that could help our tenants preserve cash. So we're looking at this holistically, it is important to realize that we think that value needs to be traded for value and we do think that this is a temporary problem, so temporary problems need temporary solutions. And so that's how our discussions continue to go. They've been productive and hopefully we'll continue to have greater visibility in the next day or in weeks when the assets will open and then we'll get a better idea of how the assets will ultimately ramp. So Ed, I'll turn it back to you. Well, to remind you, I'm recovering operator, so you can only take what I said with - that I've been there. Look, I think that I've got great confidence in these operators. You know, it reminds me of the time Churchill said, never let a good crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that is, this is something that no one would ever wish upon an industry or a country. But these operators have now had a few weeks without operating business to think about how they reopen them in new ways. And I think what you're going to see is obviously there's going to be restrictions on whether that's mask or social distancing restrictions. But they're also, as those pass over time, different ways of how the companies think about operating the business. So to answer your question, I think that will in the short term when revenues aren't going to be the way they were in 2019, you're going to see some margin differences in those performances, but I think that over a long period of time you're going to see those businesses come back. And teams are laser focused, the operating teams are preserving cash, ensuring they've got the right amount of cash in the cage, not too much, not too little. And we'll just have to see again how these businesses ultimately ramp. Yeah. I mean, I think you're thinking about this correctly. Again, we are not the operator, our tenants are, but we stay in contact and I think you're thinking about it right and that these operators are going to these states and saying look, this is unprecedented time. We don't know yet exactly the demand from our consumers when we first open up. Are there some things here that can help our liquidity position that ultimately over the next month, two months, six months, year, we'll get back to \u201cnormal operations\u201d. So I don't have the specifics. Cash is obviously one that's been. But there are other regulations that have put in place over time. Remember many of these regulations in these states were created 20, 25 years ago and made sense. I do think that there will probably be a push over time to continue to find new ways to make it more efficient for the property. So I don't have any specifics, but I'd tell you that is what the operators are doing, are pushing the states to find ways that they can have some temporary solutions to this unique situation. Yeah, I mean this is a discussion and when we announced it as I said on April 24th, as we continue to look at that market, as you know, Thomas we'll be acquiring as part of the Eldorado deal, Harrah's Atlantic City. We saw this unique opportunity to kind of decrease our position there. Well, at the same time the Wild Wild West casino and its sportsbook will be rolled into Caesars. So not all of the real estate or the asset is being sold and it also was a negotiation that allowed our rent out of the non-CPLV lease to remain the same. And we just saw this as a unique opportunity to make that transaction and for those reasons I thought it was good for us to do that. Splitting of the - go ahead, David. Go ahead, David. I think yeah, I think that's the way you should think about it. I think it's important understand also for us that it's May 1st today, the clarity on when the assets are going to open is not great. Hopefully in the next week or so we'll get greater clarity. And then how these assets ultimately ramp is not real clear. I mean, you can see there's numerous scenarios run by every operator and by us. So it's important for us to continue to see how this ultimate is going to play out. But your description is exactly how we've been thinking about it is, that these are temporary issues, there needs to be temporary solutions and those temporary solutions have to have value for value trade and that's how - that's a quick way of our overview of our philosophy. Yeah, I think Ed you started out answering the question perfectly. I mean we are long term investors of real estate. As you all know as David opened up by saying, we look at our leases over 35 years. This is pandemic has been just awful and unprecedented. But we do think that it is temporary. Now whether temporary is months or temporary is a year or year and a half, we'll have to wait and see that ultimately plays out. And I sure can't predict that. But it doesn't change our long term view of Las Vegas and our long term view of the very limited amount of assets that are on the strip in Las Vegas. So we still think that that is a community and a destination that over the long term will continue to perform and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities there, whether that's in the short term or in the long term. So I hope that gives you some visibility on how we're thinking about it. Yeah, I'll take - I'll take that. As Ed mentioned, we're opening two of our courses today and two of our courses tomorrow. And Nevada just gave the go-ahead two days ago. So we've not had a lot of pre-selling there and those will open tomorrow of course in Mississippi and our course in Indiana open today. And as Ed mentioned the tee sheets were quite full. So we'll continue to watch that. The operations like we're seeing in other hospitality areas are not full operations, meaning our clubhouses are not open our food and beverage are not open. I think we'll have some really good visibility over the next six weeks, as we're able to start marketing to consumers in our destination courses in Las Vegas. We'll obviously be more focused at the time on locals and in some of these courses like Cascata, which I'm not currently a golfer, but I know from golfers that's a bucket list course that we'll price at a fee to allow locals to come out and play. So we should see some good demand to start getting that business up and running. So to answer your specific question, I think we need a couple of weeks to better understand how it's going to ramp, but the early results at least what we're seeing in Indiana and Mississippi are quite encouraging."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Before we discuss our financial results and balance sheet, let me take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our accounting, asset management, finance and legal teams for all their efforts and relentless focus closing the quarter remotely during this pandemic, truly a remarkable effort. I'd like to point out that we added an additional schedule to the back of our earnings release, which breaks down our cash revenue by lease and the corresponding non-cash adjustments in order to tie to GAAP revenue as presented on the face of our income statement. We also disclosed this breakdown, as well as other detailed financial information in our quarterly financial supplement, which is located in the Investors section of our website under menu heading Financials. For the quarter total GAAP revenues in Q1 '20 increased 19.2% over Q1 '19 to $255 million, while total cash revenue in Q1 '20 was $257.6 million, an increase of 21.8% over Q1 2019. These increases were the result of adding $44.1 million of rent during the quarter from the Greektown, Hard Rock Cincinnati and the Century acquisitions which closed in 2019, and JACK Cleveland Thistle down acquisitions and related loan which closed on January 24th 2020. AFFO was $180 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the quarter. Our G&A was $7 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.8% for the quarter, which is in line with our full year projections and represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, as flow through of cash revenue to adjusted EBITDA was nearly a 100%. Beginning January 1st, 2020, we adopted CECL, a new accounting standard, which required us to estimate and record a non-cash provision or allowance for future credit losses relating to all existing and any future investments in direct financing and sales type leases and similar assets. CECL is applicable to us as we account for our investments as finance leases, which are subject to the new accounting standard, as opposed to operating leases like our gaming REIT peers, which are scoped out of the standard. We have historically determined that our leases effectively have 35 year durations, given the mission criticality of the assets to our tenants. This lease duration and other factors lead to our leases being classified as finance leases for accounting purposes. The CECL allowance is derived from estimated probabilities of lease default in any resulting losses over the full life of the leases, inclusive of all extension options. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused this allowance to increase in the first quarter of 2020 to reflect the current economic environment. This resulting non-cash allowances recorded through our statement of operations impacting net income and FFO, but is excluded from the calculation of AFFO due to its non-cash nature. In the first quarter, the non-cash allowance related to CECL was $149.5 million drag on net income and a $0.32 drag on net income per share. Like to again make the point, that this is a non-cash allowance and as such there is no impact to FFO and AFFO per share. Moving on to the balance sheet and capital markets activities. On January 24, 2020, we amended our credit agreement which reduced the interest rate on our term loan B from LIBOR plus 2% to LIBOR plus 175 with a LIBOR floor of 0%. On February 5th, 2020, we closed on a $2.5 billion unsecured notes offering comprised of $750 million of five year notes at 3.5%, $750 million of seven year notes at 3.75% [ph] and a $1 billion of 10.5 year notes at 4.125%. We placed $2 billion of the net proceeds into escrow pending the consummation of the Eldorado Transaction, which amount is subject to a special mandatory redemption if the Eldorado transaction does not close. The remaining $500 million of proceeds were used to retire the 8% second lien notes which were redeemed on February 20th. On February 7th, we sold 7.5 million common shares under our at-the-market equity program for net proceeds of $200 million. Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion, inclusive of the $2 billion of unsecured notes currently held in escrow with a weighted average interest rate of 4.19%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.9 years and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As the March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately five times, in our stated range in focus of maintaining net leverage between 5 and 5.5 times. This includes the impact of the restricted cash that sits in escrow. We currently have approximately $1.3 billion in liquidity comprised of approximately $310 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility which is undrawn. In addition, the company has access to approximately $1.3 billion in proceeds from the settlement of the 65 million shares that are subject to the forward sale agreements entered into in June of 2019. Between the proceeds from the equity forward agreements and the 2 billion of unsecured notes in escrow, we have three $3.2 billion of capital earmarked for the closing of the Eldorado transaction. As noted in the press release we put on April 16th, 2020, given the economic uncertainty and a rapidly evolving circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic together with the implementation of the new CEL accounting standard which significantly impacted net income, we withdrew our previously issued 2020 guidance and are not providing an updated outlook at this time. As many of you know, our guidance does not include acquisitions that have been announced but not yet closed. We believe this approach to guidance is prudent and responsible though it is typically resulted in a material difference between the range we provide and consensus estimates which do include pending acquisitions. Accordingly, we will evaluate the overall structure and usefulness of guidance going forward. Finally as it relates to the dividend, during the first quarter we paid a dividend of $0.2975, based on the annualized dividend of a dollar $19 per share, our AFFO payout ratio for the first quarter was 78%, slightly above our long range target to 75% as a result of the June 2019 equity offering. With that, operator please open the line for questions. Yeah, thanks Smedes. Hope you're well. As most people know or as you know, we set the payout ratio very low from day one. We've always had a targeted payout ratio of in around 75%. Obviously, we're a little bit above that given the equity offering from last June. But part of reason - part of the reason we set the payout ratio low is to be able to weather all storms and to maintain the dividend. And we're obviously in a hell of a storm right now. And so we're relentlessly focused on maintaining that dividend and as we work with our tenants we feel confident that we will be able to maintain that dividend as we sit here today. We have the liquidity to maintain that dividend. I think for me, it's part of your question was, would we consider paying some of that in stock, if needed we might evaluate that option, that would not be our first choice. But if things continue on and if we don't know what tomorrow brings, that's something we might evaluate. But at this time as we sit here today, we're very focused on maintaining that cash dividend. Yeah, Rich. Its David. Hope you're well. The two leases you're referring to obviously Margaritaville and in Greektown. Margaritaville reset earlier this year, 1/1/20 and we got that escalator. We're coming up on your two Greektown. We closed at May of last year, so June 1 of this year will be the reset - yeah the reset, excuse me. And we are in discussions with Penn around that, unlikely that reset happens just given the performance of the asset. Stephen, if I could just add a little more color to that as a fellow recovering operator in this case schemed off in my case. You know, when you're an operator your two main inventory items are the utilization of space and the utilization of time. The social distancing strategies that our operators undertake, as John has spoken of, they will obviously reduce space utilization at one time. But we were talking to one of our operators the other day and it's an example of how energetically and vigorously gaming operators think about the management of their two key inventory items, space and time. That they're taking a very innovative approach to how they manage the utilization of time and have identified segments in the day where specific customer demographics will be given a specific invitation to come at a specific time of day. And thus while the overall space utilization may be somewhat lower, you could potentially get higher utilization of day parts than you had previously because of the customer's willingness to adapt their behavior in order to safely visit and enjoy the casinos. And again, I take a lot of - I take a lot of encouragement and \u2013 well, not solace. But I think a lot of encouragements on how are operators are thinking about how they're going to manage their business in that respect. We're seeing the example close to home. As you know, within our TRS we own four golf courses, two of which are going to reopen tomorrow. And in southern Indiana, our tee sheet is full for the day and we're selling tee times based on social distance practices, right up until the 4 o'clock time slot. And any of you who ever been in golf course operations know, it's usually very tough to book the 4 o'clock in the afternoon time slot and it's an example of how I think the American consumer will adapt their behavior in order to enjoy what they really want to enjoy. Yes. Stephen, hope you're well. And to use a business full answer it all depends, right? It's tenant by tenant specifics and what the individual circumstances are. You know, I think you heard John say, you know, could it be a form of temporary liquidity to bridge them you know, through a period of - back to Carlos or back to the question around what what's the cage cash and what are operating needs for the couple - next couple months. You know, we do benefit from the fact that we do have liquidity, so could we buy additional assets from our tenants, could we provide some form of true liquidity versus trading an asset for rent, deferred rent. And I guess, it would - it comes down to as John said, making sure that we trade value for value. The unique aspect about the sector is that these are mission-critical assets for the tenants. And unlike the broader triple net sector, where a lot of tenants are just walking and not paying - not going to pay rent and may not ever come back, you know, given the licenses, given the importance of the assets to the tenant, to the employees, to the states and the tax revenues they generate, the tenants need to maintain these boxes and need to stay in these boxes. So you know, we will find ways to help support our tenants if needed. But you know, we're still in the early stages here as we sit here May 1st and you know, the outlook for opening is still a little bit unclear, but there's some green shoots out there. Yes... That was similar that the Reno transaction where we split the proceeds 75, 25 with Caesars that we announced at the end of - the beginning of this year. Similar proceeds split roughly 75% of the total consideration went to VICI's landlord in Caesars, as operator. Great. Thanks, Ed. And David Katz yes, as Ed said, CECL reflects the deterioration especially in Q1 in the broader economy and it's not management's expectation for any losses in the current portfolio, it is simply an accounting standard, it's a non-cash allowance. And if you look at you know, note 6 page 28, 29 of our 10 Q, we've put some good disclosure in there around how CECL evolved over the first quarter. On 1/1/2020, we had to record an initial allowance, that was 2.88% of our total investment balance. That number on a normalized - normal economic environment should answer your question David, should move around 5, 10 maybe 15 basis points a quarter. Given COVID, given the downturn, it spiked up to about 100 basis points this quarter, so that it's - the model is all identifiable inputs really around credit rating and the economic outlook of the economy. And so that's what drove the change. But once we get back to normalize run rate, you're right David, it should be much - it will be less volatile and stay within a little - more of a stated range. No I think you described it well. Ed, I think will \u2013 I have nothing to add to that. Yeah. Thanks, Seam. And as Yogi Berra once said, it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future, so you know this is where we think - this is where we take comfort in the master lease and especially across the Caesars portfolio which obviously has assets all across the country, Vegas and in very, very good regional network. So we came into this you know north of three times on a corporate coverage, given the wholly owned assets in the Caesars - in the Caesars portfolio, primarily on the Vegas strip, that corporate coverage will come down and nobody really knows where you know what the ramp will be what EBITDA will be. But you know the corporate coverage is key to us and obviously we have that with Century, Penn and you know we have the individual leases with Penn where we are [indiscernible] corporate coverage and then Hard Rock is also a corporate coverage. But given the investment grade nature of that and then we feel very, very comfortable with that and we have a corporate coverage on a smaller entity with JACK, very meaningful investment where Dan Gilbert one of the owners there. So we'll have to see. It's hard it's hard to take. It's hard to predict, the coverages will come down but we don't really you know, we don't have a good sense as John talked about how this ultimately opens and ramps. Yeah I can do it. Sean, couldn't think of another entertain that. Look its an entity called Rock Ohio Ventures, ROV. It owns the two casinos Jack Cleveland, JACK Thistle. JACK Cleveland actually sits within the Higbee building, which is part of ROV, Rock Ohio Ventures, as a garage next door. And then some additional land right in that area. So that's part of the reason we ultimately did that loan to JACK is there's additional real estate collateral within that entity."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 24, 2022. I would now hand the conference over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties' website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and our supplemental information. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and our counterparties described during the call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, let me just say on behalf of VICI that our hearts very much go out this morning to the people of Ukraine. Today, I want to begin the call by addressing two topics: VICI's growth and total return over our first four years, and our closing of our Venetian acquisition and what it signifies about VICI and our asset class. I'll then turn the call over to John, who will talk about our ongoing growth initiatives; and to David, who will talk about our 2021 results and our financing activities. The year we just included 2021 constituted VICI's fourth full year of operations and growth. If measured from our emergence date in October 2017, a bit more than four years ago, we've accomplished following. We have announced $29 billion of acquisitions, establishing VICI as one of the most dynamic growth platforms in American REIT management. We have raised more than $12 billion of common equity, more than any other REIT in America over that period. Pro forma for our announced acquisitions, we will have grown our portfolio NOI by more than 4x. We have lowered our leverage from 8.5x adjusted EBITDA at emergence to 3.1x at the end of 2021, and moreover, transformed the right side of our balance sheet from entirely secured to substantially unsecured debt. And by transforming the magnitude and composition of our debt, we have put ourselves, we believe, on the cusp of investment-grade ratings. We've demonstrated the resilience of our assets and of our tenants through 100% on time [Audio Dip] to date. Most importantly, for VICI's stockholders, we generated from October 18, 2017, through December 31, 2021, a total return of 100.5%. This compares to the S&P 500 total return of 100.7% over that period and a total return for the RMZ of 58.9%, meaning VICI outperformed the RMZ over that period by 41.6 percentage points. Here is a simpler way of looking at it: $1 invested into VICI at the beginning of that period became $2, $1 invested into the RMZ over the same period became $1.59. An integral part of VICI's superior total return has been VICI's dividend growth over the period, with aggregate dividend per share growth of 37.1% since our first full quarter dividend payment in Q2 2018. We're proud of the value we've created over our first four years, but here's what we're really excited about today. We just closed yesterday on the acquisition of one of the most magnificent Class A assets in American commercial real estate, The Venetian. Let me reiterate the features we cited when we announced The Venetian transaction nearly a year ago. The Venetian is the single largest hotel complex in America with nearly 7,100 rooms. The Venetian is the largest private sector meeting convention trade show facility in America. At 13 million square feet of Class A quality, finding another building in America with more marble, we have brought The Venetian at a price per square foot of approximately $300, 82 acres of land that included an estimated 62% discount replacement cost. When we announced The Venetian acquisition in early March 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was still heavily and negatively impacting Las Vegas visitation and resort performance. Apollo, our new Venetian operating partner, and VICI were both mindful of that. And in a period when most potential Venetian buyers were not willing or able to come out into the heavy weather, VICI and Apollo were able to craft a transaction that protected against continuing uncertainty, but was fundamentally based in the belief that Las Vegas and moreover The Venetian would eventually return to 2019 levels of performance. What VICI and Apollo did not assume when we announced this transaction in March 2021 is that Las Vegas and The Venetian would over the ensuing 12 months stage a roaring comeback, achieving run rate profitability levels that are beyond 2019. Over the last 12 months, Rob Goldstein and Patrick Dumont's team at Las Vegas Sands, led by George Markantonis, have done a magnificent job of managing The Venetian. As LVS reported on January 26, The Venetian produced these eye-popping performance figures in Q4 2021, 100% occupancy of The Venetian's nearly 7,100 rooms and doing so without the full return of meeting convention trade show business. For the fourth quarter, The Venetian generated $154 million of adjusted property EBITDA and a margin of 34.5%. This amount of EBITDA annualized would mean over $600 million of run rate EBITDA before rent or nearly 2.5x coverage of our initial Venetian annual rent of $250 million. As for value, I just want to remind everyone that we have acquired The Venetian, again, one of the most magnificent and majestic Class A assets in American Commercial Real Estate at a cap rate of 6.25%, which we believe makes this one of the most compelling Class A single asset transactions in America REIT management in recent years. And if it isn't, someone you need to tell me what comped it. And here, as much work as I put into preparing these remarks, I actually \u2013 I have to quote one of you who posted last night this date, which I think says better than anything I've said, what we did in buying The Venetian, to quote simply put VICI got a pretty sweet deal. By looking past the short-term disruption in Las Vegas created by COVID, VICI was able to get one of the most iconic real estate assets in the country for a cap rate that today couldn't even buy you a well-located Dollar General. Finally, not only did we buy Venetian at a 6.25% cap rate, we have leased the Class A real estate of The Venetian to Apollo on a triple net basis with the superior economic transparency and integrity that the triple net lease model generally provides. And that highlights the final point I want to make about our first four years at VICI. Over this period, one can say that we have brought gaming real estate into the triple net lease sector. But I think what's more important is that we have brought the superiority of the triple net lease model to Class A real estate. Triple net real estate is sometimes criticized for being commodity real estate in low barrier-to-entry locations bought at a premium to replacement cost. Here is what we've done in VICI in our first four years in real estate investment terms. We've built America's biggest and best portfolio of differentiated non-commodity Class A experiential real estate in high-barrier-to-entry locations bought at substantial discounts to replacement cost. And here may be the most important portfolio attribute of all. Our real estate is occupied by, we believe, the best experiential operators in the world as evidenced by their market-leading resilience during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic and their market-leading recovery to unprecedented levels of profitability. Thanks for bearing with me while I share my excitement for what we've done at VICI. And now I'll turn the call over to John Payne, who will share our excitement over what we're doing to continue to grow VICI. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning everyone. 2021 sure was another successful and transformative year for VICI as we announced over $21 billion of transactions, solidifying our position as the number one experiential REIT in terms of acquisition volume, significantly increasing our scale and furthering our credibility as one of America's blue-chip REITs. As Ed said, we are very happy to announce that the acquisition of Venetian Las Vegas closed yesterday. And our acquisition of MGP remains on track to close in the first half of this year. Since we announced the acquisition of The Venetian, we witnessed cap rate compression in Las Vegas seemingly in real time, with City Center trading at a 5.5% cap rate and The Cosmopolitan at a 4.97% cap. Additionally, since our announced acquisition of MGP, regional cap rates have continued to compress, with Encore Boston Harbor, a large-scale, high-quality urban assets recently trading at a cap rate in the high 5s. We have been pounding the table about the quality of gaming real estate and its superior investment characteristics relative to many real estate asset classics \u2013 classes since our formation. We believe that in many ways, the most recent trading cap rates are directly applicable to the value of the assets in our portfolio. It is gratifying to see our thesis come to fruition. And we believe there is much more to come as gaming real estate becomes a mainstream real estate asset class. Upon closing our MGP transaction, we believe we will have a portfolio of assets with quality unmatched by any other leisure real estate portfolio. Our rental streams and underlying asset cash flow durability has proven through the \u2013 has been proven through the pandemic. We have tenant relationships with industry-leading operators who utilize extensive CRM capabilities to be engaged with the consumers. And as many of you know these capabilities, combined with our tenants' operational expertise, has led to record profitability in Las Vegas and across the region. Now as we think about VICI's future growth prospects, we see a long runway for growth within gaming. Many operators continue to study and understand how VICI's capital can be utilized in their capital stack and we have regular dialogue with a number of public and private operators that continue to own their real estate. Additionally, we've started allocating capital towards other leisure verticals, which we believe will round out our investments over time. We will approach additional leisure investments in a prudent manner by studying the opportunities and market dynamics in detail and perform an appropriate diligence and risk-reward analysis prior to allocating capital on behalf of our shareholders. One of our fundamental goals as a company is to grow earnings per share accretively on behalf of our shareholders. We believe this aligns our success with the interest of our shareholders and we do not approach investments blindly in order to just satisfy investment volumes or other arbitrary measurements. To that end, I will repeat the pillars that we believe will drive accretive growth for VICI and create value for our shareholders well into the future. We will strive to execute the compelling opportunities in our embedded growth pipeline. We will study and evaluate open-market gaming transactions in the United States and internationally. We will partner with existing tenants under our property growth fund through which we will seek to fund high-return growth projects at our existing properties and we will allocate resources towards studying leisure and experiential investments as well as large-scale M&A opportunities. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and our financial results. David?\nDavid Kieske: Great. Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2021 continued the relentless focus we have maintained over our four plus years of existence on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. This disciplined focus was rewarded during 2021 by: first, the depth of the support from the equity capital markets to derisk the equity funding for our $21 billion of announced acquisitions; and second, from the culmination of one of our most important objectives since emergence, and that is to finally transform our balance sheet into an unsecured borrower. As Ed mentioned, we believe we are on the cusp of achieving an investment-grade rating. To recap, as we look back at 2021, in March, we raised $2 billion of equity through a $69 million share forward sale agreement. In September, we raised $3.4 billion of equity through a 65 million share regular way offering and a 50 million share forward sale agreement. Raising $5.4 billion of equity is not something we take for granted, and we greatly appreciate the support of our equity holders to be able to derisk the equity funding and take advantage of two unique opportunities that presented themselves during the year. The September offering, in fact, was recognized by International Financing Review, or IFR, as the North America secondary equity issue of the year. We are thankful to our underwriters led by Morgan Stanley as well as a full syndicate of banks, for the support to be able to execute the largest common equity follow-on ever by a REIT. In September, we fully repaid our $2.1 billion secured term loan. This was a critical step on our path towards investment grade. Also in September, we announced the successful early participation in the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the $4.2 billion of outstanding MGP notes. As a result, upon closing of the MGP transaction, the covenants under the existing MGP indentures will be aligned with the covenants, restrictions and events of default under the existing VICI indentures. In December, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into three additional agreements with a notional amount of $1.5 billion. The interest rate swap transactions, so far totaling $2 billion, are intended to reduce the variability in the interest expense related to the debt we expect to incur with the closing of the MGP acquisition. In addition, subsequent to year-end, we closed on a new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a $1 billion delayed draw term loan, increasing our overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital. The revolver maturity runs to March of 2026 before extension options with grid-based pricing. Based on the company's current credit ratings, the revolving credit facility bears interest at SOFR plus 132.5 basis points, an improvement in pricing from 200 basis points over LIBOR under our prior secured revolving credit facility. Just to recap The Venetian funding, which we closed yesterday. We settled the March and September outstanding forward sale agreements, bringing 119 million shares onto our balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. We drew $600 million on our revolver with the remaining proceeds coming from cash to close the $4 billion Venetian acquisition. I also want to highlight that the settlement of the two forward sale agreements will all but eliminate the outsized short interest that VICI has been subject to. As of January 31st, we had approximately 85 million shares of short interest, which the majority was from the mechanics of the forward sale agreements. To summarize 2021 and the events at the start of 2022 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet, which are to maintain a long-term target leverage goal of 5 to 5.5 on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis; maintain an unsecured capital structure and an unencumbered asset pool; pursue a disciplined composition and laddering of fixed rate debt, safeguarding the company's balance sheet against future market volatility; opportunistically accessing the capital markets to lock in funding certainty for all transactions and ultimately achieving an investment-grade rating. We have been relentless in our drive towards an investment-grade rating and we believe the actions we took during 2021 and at the start of 2022 should position VICI to be able to access the investment-grade market when we seek to raise the $4.4 billion of permitted debt required to redeem the MGM OP units at the time of closing the MGP transactions, all while continuing to maintain ample liquidity, flexibility and optionality to grow accretively. Turning to the income statement. AFFO for the fourth quarter was $278.9 million, or $0.44 per share, bringing full year 2021 AFFO to $1.0474 billion, or $1.82 per share. Total AFFO in 2021 increased 25.3% year-over-year while AFFO per share increased approximately 11% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count and resulting temporary dilution from the March and September forward equity offerings. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 12.9% primarily as the result of the settlements of the June 2020 forward sale agreement in September of 2021, which added 26.9 million shares to our balance sheet in the regular way portion of the September offering, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet. The proceeds from both of these offerings were used to repay the $2.1 billion secured term loan in September. We refer you to our press release where we've added two tables detailing our outstanding common shares and a reconciliation of the weighted average shares of common stock used in the calculation of earnings per share. These tables are on Page 5 of our release that was posted to our website last night. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $9 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenue was only 2.4%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Finally, I want to touch on our leverage. We ended 2021 with net debt-to-EBITDA of 3.1x and pro forma for The Venetian closing, our net debt-to-EBITDA is 3x. This highlights the fact that we have significantly over-equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the MGP acquisition, positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt required to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction. As I touch on guidance, this will be important. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions, specifically the pending acquisition of MGP or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. As we have discussed, we record a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which is due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. Our guidance incorporates the recently closed Venetian acquisition and the settlement of the 119 million shares that were subject to the March and September forward sale agreements. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2022, will be between $1.317 billion and $1.347 billion or between $1.80 and $1.84 per diluted share. The midpoint of our total AFFO guidance on an absolute dollars represents an increase of 27.2% versus our 2021 actual AFFO. On a per share basis, guidance reflects all of the equity raise to close the transactions we announced in 2021. And thus, the corresponding increase in VICI's share count without the benefit of the corresponding income from the pending MGP transaction. Accordingly, we expect to update guidance in the future to reflect the impact of the MGP transaction when we are in a position to do so. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Of course, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from RJ Milligan with Raymond James. RJ, your line is now open.\nRJ Milligan: Good morning guys. I wanted to maybe ask a bigger picture question, Ed. What do you think of Realty Income's entry in the gaming asset class? What does that mean for VICI? Obviously, adds more competition. But you have a new operator embracing the sale-leaseback model. Pricing sort of implies that your stock is undervalued, but maybe lower cap rates hurt spread in the future. How do you think about those different puts and takes?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. RJ, always good to chat with you. Net-net, it is unalloyed positive to have an institution of the quality and stature of Realty Income come in and validate our category. Realty Income goes back to 1969. They've built an amazing company. Samit has obviously continued to drive excellence at that company and drive very judicious allocation of capital, both categorically and geographically. So we've been saying, as John spoke of in his remarks, RJ, we've been saying since the beginning that this is an asset class that we believe is the next great institutionalization story in American commercial real estate. Well, institutionalization does not happen if institutions don't come into the category. And the more institutions to come into the category, the further institutionalized it is. There are puts and takes. You're absolutely right. When there's more competition, we have to work hard every single day to make sure that our cost of capital over the longer term, leaving aside the volatility we face in this current situation like this, but over time, we're improving the cost of capital on both an absolute and/or a relative basis at a velocity equal to the rate of cap rate compression. So again, net-net, we see it as very positive. And I think in this case, especially validating of regional assets, with the MGP transaction, we will be become the owners, the very proud owners of assets like National Harbor right on the Potomac River in D.C. We will become owners of the Borgata, of MGM Detroit, of Beau Rivage. These are assets that are absolutely in the same class as Encore Boston. And as John also alluded to in his remarks, if you look through the cap rate of Wynn Boston and what we are acquiring in MGP in terms of preeminent regional assets, we're obviously very happy with the revaluation that we believe our shareholders deserve.\nRJ Milligan: Thanks for those comments. And then my second question is just, can you be a little bit more specific on the expected timing of the closing of the MGP transaction? And then maybe, David, what you're seeing out there in the debt markets and expected pricing for the debt that's going to be issued?\nEd Pitoniak: Samantha, you want to take timing and then David can talk financing?\nSamantha Gallagher: Sure. Just on timing, I'll just mention that we do continue to work through the process with all the applicable jurisdictions and [indiscernible].\nDavid Kieske: Thanks. RJ, as it relates to the debt markets, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've built a $2 billion hedge portfolio to start to minimize the volatility that we're witnessing, obviously, real time today. One of the aspects \u2013 a couple of the aspects that we have going forward is when we underwrote The Venetian as well as MGP, we underwrote that in the high-yield markets. And with the work that our team has done with the agencies and as we mentioned in our remarks, we feel very confident that we'll be issuing debt into the investment-grade market when we can do so and once we're positioned through regulatory approval, which Samantha just alluded to. So our underwriting remains in line with what we underwrote originally even with the uptick in rates. And obviously, today is a unique day with the volatility going out on in the markets. But for 10-year pricing, we're getting quotes in the high-100, low-200 over treasury for 10-year paper. So on a blended basis, we still feel good about our overall accretion and everything that we laid out for you back in August of last year.\nRJ Milligan: Thanks a lot.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you RJ.\nOperator: Thank you RJ. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Wes, your line is now open.\nWes Golladay: Hey, good morning everyone. Could you talk about your appetite to buy more assets while MGP is still pending and you currently have a little bit higher cost of capital? I believe Caesars mentioned on their call that we were going to be looking to sell an asset over the near term.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I'll take the last part of that, and I'll turn it over to John in terms of our ongoing energy around growth activities. Yes, you did see Tom Reeg announced last week his intentions to bring an asset to market. And obviously, we will take full advantage of the opportunity we have to get that very full first look and to see what possible advantages the addition of another asset could have and the addition of other relationships. But I just want to emphasize the fact that given obviously, not only the volatility in the market, but what are the hallmarked practices of great capital allocators, as a good real estate capital allocator, you never want the answer to the question of why did you buy that to be, well, it was for sale, right? I want to focus on somebody who had a great adage, which is, spent every dollar of capital like it's the last one you have.\" So whatever the opportunities may be, we will only allocate capital if we feel versus our other alternatives, it is the best use of capital at a given time. And then in terms of our ongoing growth activities, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Good morning, Wes. As you know, these deals don't happen over the first month. So we're very active, continuing to talk to the operators on the gaming side as we had since we started the company. And we're spending, as I said in my remarks, quite a bit of time in what we call the hospitality or experiential space, sitting down with C-suite executives of certain companies in certain industries explaining how our capital could help them grow and we could be partners over time. So we're very active. And as Ed said, we'll be very prudent in the way that we put out our capital.\nWes Golladay: Okay. And then there is a strong bid for the regional assets. Would you entertain recycling assets, selling some assets if they're sees opportunity was something you like? Or would you look to lean in a little bit of leverage, maybe go over your, I guess, I think you mentioned, Dave, at 5.5% on the high end is where you want leverage. Would you be willing to take leverage a little higher than that? I guess how would you fund it if you were to find something?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Wes, I mean, we're going to look at alternatives that are in front of us. As it relates to recycling assets, I mean, that's not \u2013 we have recycled an asset in Atlantic City, asset in Reno, we just in our release, we sold Louisiana Downs. So potentially, there could be that opportunity. There could be potential JV opportunities. You've obviously seen MGP joint venture, some assets in the past. And then the attractiveness of a REIT and the ability to issue OP units that we are doing directly to MGM, GLPI is doing that to Cordis. So there's other avenues of equity. As it relates to taking leverage up, we're pretty disciplined with our dialogue with the agencies of our goal. We've gotten a path to take leverage up to six times. When you take leverage up and that's just financial engineering to drive accretion, and that's something that we strive to do. So we'll stay within our guidepost. But I think there's other tools in the toolbox that we can bring to the table to, as John said, pursue opportunities that we're in dialogue with.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thanks everyone for the time.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks Wes.\nOperator: Thank you Wes. Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotia Bank. Greg, your line is now open.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey, good morning. So just curious, it sounds like Realty Income was able to get kind of Boston Encore deal without any competing offers. So had you previously tried to acquire this asset? And any thoughts as to why Wynn did not run a bid process on that location? And I guess do you think you would have been competitive at the 5.9% cap with no CapEx minimums?\nEd Pitoniak: I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Greg. But you absolutely would have to ask Wynn why they did not run a process. Sumit Roy in Realty Income's earnings call yesterday, as you are implicitly referring to, clearly stated there was no process. And again, you're going to have to ask Wynn why did you not run a process. And above and beyond that, I don't know how much more we can or should say about the asset, given that we were not part of the process. But John, I'll hand it over to you to see what you might want to say.\nJohn Payne: I think we've already said it. Look, it's a great validation of the value of our real estate, right? I mean if you take National Harbor, there's an asset as good a quality, I'd even say it's better quality, right? And so the cap rate that's put on that asset really just the validation of what we've been talking about for four-years when we started this company.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And I guess just two follow-ups on kind of potential investments. So thinking about the partner property growth fund, how are you guys viewing the likelihood of those transactions occurring? Or maybe the potential to reach the $1 billion and separately $1.5 billion max amounts?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Well, we're having active conversations with all our tenants about opportunities where they can use our capital to grow, we can gain incremental rent over time. I'm not a big guy who tells you, predicts what exactly we're going to do. But what I can tell you is this fund has been well received by our tenants. And I think there are some large projects, growth projects in the future that I believe will be a part of with our tenants. And it will be exciting to be \u2013 exciting to help them grow and be excited to help us grow.\nEd Pitoniak: Greg, I would just add in regard to our property \u2013 partner property growth fund is that when the projects achieve the needed return hurdle and of course, our investments will be contingent upon them, clearly demonstrating that they can achieve that hurdle, we are in extremely attractive source of capital for our partners based on the cost of our capital. Because when the given investments can achieve the necessary hurdles, the cost of our capital should not be compared only to the cost of the debt capital of our partners. It really, given that we can, in many cases, alleviate them, the need for them to put in any incremental equity, the cost of our capital should be compared not again to the cost of their debt capital, but to their weighted average cost of capital, inclusive of both equity and debt. And on that basis, we become, again, a very compelling source of low-cost capital.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. I guess just the final piece of the pipeline. So you got this potential ROFR, which you guys said you'll be evaluating this whether or not that's within the portfolio. But also the [indiscernible] the Indiana, Caesars asset you can potentially call this year. Can you just remind us how the pricing is determined there and whether the ease investment is part impact your desire to get something done in the near-term?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: I'll let David talk a little bit about the structure. I'll talk about the assets. First of all, they're just great assets. They're big. They're growing. As you touched on, Caesars just rebranded the asset, one of the assets in Indianapolis to a horseshoe. They're investing large chunks of capital into both of the businesses there as table games was legalized at these casinos. And so these assets have not only grown under the Caesars' leadership, they will continue to grow as these assets get the capital and then stabilize. So we're continuing to watch it. We think these are going to be great additions to our portfolio. And then David can tell you a little bit how the deal was structured and how it would enter into our master lease. David?\nDavid Kieske: Sure. Thanks, John. as you referenced, that put call started January 1 of this year. It runs to December 31, 2024. We can call those two assets at a 7.7% cap, or Tom and team can put them to us at an 8% cap. It's an LTM coverage ratio that was set at 1.3 times. Part of the reason we agreed to that within the broader funding of Eldorado acquisition at Caesars is that those assets will go into the regional master lease. And those are two very attractive assets, as John alluded to, and something that we'll assess how we sequence that into our growth and the cadence that we have internally with everything else going on over the period of time. But just given where cap rates have gone, we're very excited to potentially own those assets at some point here.\nEd Pitoniak: Let me just add in regard to the 1.3 coverage, as David spoke about, these will go into the regional master lease. But we got comfortable when Tom Reeg closed that coverage level to us a few years ago based upon our confidence that the new Caesars under Tom's leadership would achieve corporate profitability levels that give us very strong corporate rent coverage, making us comfortable with the 1.3. Well, needless to say, Tom's team have greatly exceeded our expectations in terms of the corporate profitability there and will achieve at Caesars. And thus, again, to re-stress the point, why in this case at the asset level we were willing to take on that asset level coverage given what is proving to be rather magnificent corporate level rent coverage, which is part of a corporate rent guarantee.\nJohn Payne: And I just want to add one thing to what David said that I don't want to make sure it's lost. We have the right to call this at a 7.7% cap. And there was a transaction that just happened in the regional markets for a 5.9% cap.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Greg. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist. Barry, your line is now open.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. You guys obviously have and will have the largest portfolio in gaming right now. I'm curious if there are any geographies or segments of the market you're less inclined to expand on at this point?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: I'll take that, Barry. I'll answer it more in there's areas of opportunity where we'd like to own real estate. If you think of the Las Vegas market, which I know, Barry, you follow closely, you look at the regional performers there, how well they've performed during before the pandemic and after the pandemic or as they were coming out of the pandemic. We don't own any real estate in Downtown Las Vegas. If you see how Circa has changed that market and the way people think about that market, Tillman and his team have done a great job there for years. So if there's an opportunity on real estate in the Downtown Las Vegas market, which is a big market. We don't own assets in Reno, Colorado, Rhode Island. We don't have Pittsburgh, like Charles, others. So there's still quite a few gaming markets that we don't own assets. And as we talked earlier, we've got a ROFRs here on another Las Vegas asset. So many opportunities for us. Haven't had opportunities where I'm saying I wouldn't go into, but I'm sure there's a few we feel like we've got enough real estate. But I really want to answer that where we see that there's continued opportunity.\nBarry Jonas: That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, given the current macro environment we're seeing, I'm curious if that's impacted the timing or pace of any M&A discussions you may be having?\nEd Pitoniak: Barry, it's been a pretty wild four-years, right? I wouldn't bother naming the ball. But we had the interest rate kind of crack up of spring of 2018. We had December of 2018 which none of us hope we have to look through again anytime soon. We've obviously had March 2020. We have obviously learned to live and deal with volatility at VICI. And I think if taken one key lesson, it's that don't stop developing relationships in times of volatility because times of volatility will eventually come to an end. So to be honest with you, we just shut out the noise and we keep doing what we're doing. We obviously can't be heedless by any means of our cost of capital at any given time and have to take care to make sure we know where the money is going to come from and what the money is going to cost us. But again, I just want to re-emphasize the point that periods of volatility cannot be periods of dormancy in terms of our fundamental activity every single day, which is working to develop relationships, it will ultimately turn into deal flow.\nBarry Jonas: That\u2019s great. Thanks Ed. Thanks guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, Barry.\nOperator: Thank you, Barry. Our next question comes from Daniel Adam with Loop Capital Markets. Daniel, your line is now open.\nDaniel Adam: Hi. Thank you and good morning everyone. Just to follow up on Realty Income\u2019s deal for Encore Boston. I'm curious whether you guys think this sub 6% cap rate marks a turning point or call it new normal, if you will, for regional asset valuations in general or whether you see that as more of a one-off just given the quality and location of Encore?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Daniel, always good to hear from you. I may have mentioned this on prior earnings calls, but one of the things I am struck by within gaming, generally in gaming real estate specifically, is we have not yet come up with a widely accepted hierarchy of quality classification, right? As many of you know, I used to work in the hotel sector, where there's a clearly accepted \u2013 well, there's a few clearly accepted hierarchies of quality, whether it's based on Star five, four, three, two so on and so forth, or whether it's luxury, upper upscale and so on and so forth. Well, that categorization does not yet exist in games. Really doesn't exist so much on the strip. And it definitely doesn't exist in regional. So if you were to try to impose a hierarchy of quality on regional gaming, there is a highest level of regional gaming asset quality that would include assets like Encore Boston, National Harbor, MGM Detroit Borgata, Beau Rivage, Caesars New Orleans, especially after the Caesars team puts in the capital that they're about to spend, Harrah's Atlantic City. There is this higher tier of assets, and Encore Boston has set a new benchmark cap rate for the highest tier regional assets. And usually, when the top category in an asset class establishes a new benchmark in terms of lower cap rates, there can and usually is a slip stream effect on the lower quality \u2013 lower categories of quality. So I guess maybe your implicit question, does Encore Boston create a slip stream not only for the highest end regional properties, which we will be the market leader in owning, but will it also create a upstream for other regional assets? And we believe it would because again, you look at the resiliency through COVID. If you look at the indispensability of the asset to the operator, you look at the barriers to entry, if you look at all of the classic real estate valuation metrics and frameworks, you have to concede these are really good assets, and they are woefully underpriced.\nDaniel Adam: That makes a ton of sense. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned evaluating deals outside of the U.S. Are there any markets in particular that you're focused on internationally?\nEd Pitoniak: David, do you want to take that?\nDavid Kieske: Sure. Dan, nice to talk to you. I mean as we look outside the U.S., we look most simplistically what's readable and what is a good rule logo, obviously, good real estate, but good tax jurisdictions and things jurisdictions like Canada, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Europe, UK. Less \u2013 maybe less so gaming in the Europe, UK, just given the nature of the \"boxes.\" But we talked about realty income here a lot going into gaming. They've obviously gone into Spain and Europe and other jurisdictions. You've seen other REITs like Simon go abroad. So there are opportunities that we're looking at and assessing across the globe. And as we continue to grow, we've got the infrastructure and the expertise to do so. And we look to continue to develop those opportunities and ultimately bring those sorts of opportunities into our portfolio over time.\nDaniel Adam: Okay. Great. Thanks so much guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Daniel.\nOperator: Thanks Daniel. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes, your line is now open.\nMichael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. Ed, I wanted to come back to your opening comments and you spent some time talking about the last four years since emerging as a new public entity and the successes that you've had and the total return and the dividend growth, which has all been pretty strong. I wanted to get your sense of how you think about issuing equity in the future, just in the sense that if you were to break down the different periods of time in your total return, there clearly has been a little bit more of a lackluster performance since last summer, I think, driven in part by the overhangs that you've created with the equity issuances, but also the commitments that you have going forward and the fact that leverage levels are towards the higher end of where you want it to be. And then you look at the valuation of the company today relative to right before the pandemic, and it's actually widened relative to REITs as REITs have done a little bit better from that time frame point to point even though you've talked about all the positives that have occurred since pre-pandemic, including the fact that all your tenants pay rent, which no one thought going into any type of recession would have happened. So I want you to sort of step back and think about it more so over the recent time frame in terms of the performance and how you believe you're going to be able to drive outperformance from this point forward and how the sort of equity issuance ties into that.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Michael, it is a profound and extremely important question. It is one David and I especially have been wrestling with really going back to last fall, soon after we raised the equity for MGP, which we did use yesterday for The Venetian, but that's all because of the fungibility of cash. Yes, it's a profound question. And I would say that our strategy going forward, having done the transformative deals we've done, Venetian to a degree, but especially MGP is that having achieved the scale we've achieved, having in place some of the built-in growth elements that we do have, we really want to begin to develop more of a flow model. We want gaming and nongaming to achieve the cadence of deal flow that is both more sustained, simple. And accordingly, we want our fundraising activities to be, frankly, less gargantuan. You are absolutely right. It's been a slog since, well, especially since late summer. We actually won in late summer was pretty much the week of Labor Day, things will earn and then that happened to be we raised the equity for MGP. And we're glad we did it when we did Michael, and we do thank the Citi team for their help in doing so. And we realized that, that sheer amount of equity, $5.5 billion in 2021 did have a weighty effect on the performance of our stock. And we really appreciate the patience of our shareholders. We were very pleased to see the [indiscernible] how steady our core shareholders remain through the turbulence of Q4. And we're hopeful that, that is still prove to be the case here in Q1. Going forward, we do want to create a business model that is sustained and sustainable and lessens on these kinds of gargantuan equity raises. I hope that gets to the core of the question you were asking.\nMichael Bilerman: Yes. And I think taking a step further. It still feels as though there is some level of overhang on the shares. Given all the positives and the accretive nature of the transactions that you've done, right, estimates have been moving up, yet the multiple has been contracting. And so I think that there's certainly amount of nervousness about a next gargantuan raise a, to finally deal with the funding of closing MGP, but also these other types of transactions, whether they be the ROFR. And I think that there's just this tension in the marketplace. And so that's where I was trying to get at is where your heads at now in terms of eliminating this overhang that appears to be on your shares? And maybe you need another potential to raise before you get into this more normal pace, and that's what I'm just trying to I don't know where your heads at in terms of financing this level of growth given this commitment to get to investment-grade as well.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. So just to be clear, we do not need to raise any further equity for MGP. We have raised all the equity we need. We will be raising only debt. We will obviously have a share exchange on a fixed exchange ratio with the MGP shareholders, including MGM. So there's no equity further needs for MGP. And when it comes to a ROFR or any other opportunity, again, just to re-emphasize the point, we're very mindful of the fact that we need to consider every possible way of funding such opportunities if and only if they're compellingly accretive for our shareholders. And it will be our bias to not have to raise our grants to an amount of equity because we're very conscious of the fact that we need to give our shareholders understood broadly a chance to realize that revaluation that they deserve, and it will be easier to achieve if we do not go out into the market and raise a little ton of equity to use the technical term.\nMichael Bilerman: So are you having those discussions today in terms of joint ventures or selling incremental land parcels or assets outright to put yourself in a funding position so that when a pitch comes down, you're already been funded, getting to this point where you almost go below your target leverage levels and sort of eliminate that as an overhang?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. We are looking at all those things. And maybe I'll just turn it over to David quickly, and he can talk about the way in which we are going to very strategically use the amount of retained cash that we will be building up given our payout ratio, David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Ed and Michael, always good to talk to you. I mean even just taking a step back when we went into the MGP transaction in June, July, August, we assessed all options around how do navigate what is ultimately a significant capital raise, I mean, $3.4 billion of equity. And that's something we took lightly and something that we had a lot of other levers that we could have potentially pulled, and we were able to obviously execute that with everybody's help. But as we closed MGP here, and Samantha said the first half of the year and then is moving along very well, you get to kind of a run rate of roughly $2 billion of AFFO \u2013 feedback, take 75% of that out for dividends, you've got roughly $500 million of free cash flow. And that is true free cash flow. As you know, we have no CapEx. We have our G&A is our G&A. There's not a lot of other items that need to come out of that free cash flow. So if you lever that 2:1, that's $1 billion of buying power that we have internally to continue to deliver the growth that we've delivered since day one.\nMichael Bilerman: Great. And then just second topic just in terms of Encore and the Wynn. How do you it obviously was a negotiated transaction between Wynn and Realty Income? I think when you look in to Wynn's peak, you obviously hear the desire of them to have negotiated items that were very important to their enterprise. And obviously, Realty Income had to get what they want to get out of it. As you think about these leases, obviously, the Encore didn't have a CapEx requirement. It had bumps that were below 2% for the first 10 years. How do you think about the structure of that transaction, put aside the pricing because you've made your comments that you thought it validated and was rich from that perspective, setting a new mark for these regional assets. But how do you think about the individual key terms? And what are the critical factors for you as you continue to grow in gaming real estate?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Michael, I think Realty Income and VICI are fairly different companies running different kinds of rent roles, running different kinds of risks. I think I saw in Samit's [ph] remarks that their weighted average lease term at this point is 14 years. Ours is 43.5 years. So given that delta in just, for example, weighted average lease terms, things that report to us like the magnitude of rent escalation, like the magnitude of CapEx, maybe more important to us than to Samit were Wynn will represent \u2013 I think Encore will represent 3% of its rent rule. I think we both have different levers. We both have \u2013 we both run different profiles. So what would be really important to us, maybe it's not important to him.\nMichael Bilerman: Yes. And that's what I was just trying to get at, whether you're sort of non-negotiables in terms of when you go into these, what you're willing to accept and what you're not? It sounds like the CapEx side and a certain sort of growth rate given the longer lease duration are important variables for you. Is there anything else? Obviously, corporate coverage here was north of 2x, and that should grow given the performance of the asset. Just what are the other variables that are critical for you as you continue to embark down this road?\nEd Pitoniak: Well, obviously one right now that's very, very critical is some measure of CPI protection. And correct me if I'm wrong, but once we achieve CPI protection in our MGM lease, and Danny step in Europe of getting this call, 90% will have BPI protection built into it. And needless to say, we've always thought that to be important, Michael. But it feels really much more important right now than it did 1 year or two ago. I'm sorry, Michael, that broke up.\nMichael Bilerman: You said you had a cap on that though, don't you? There's a limit to that inflation protection?\nEd Pitoniak: We do in some leases. We don't in others. The Caesars leases are uncapped, which is why we posted a 5.0-odd percent rent increase on November 1 out of the Caesars Las Vegas lease.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. All right. Thanks guys. See you in a week half.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes indeed. Looking forward to it. Operator, we will take one more question.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Todd, your line is now open.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Yes. Hi. Good morning. I appreciate the comments around the timing of the closing, being on track for the first half of the year with regards to MGP. But what are the primary hurdles to closing that remain? And then David, your understanding of the timing to achieve an investment-grade rating, what's the time line look there?\nEd Pitoniak: David, why don't you start with the time line and maybe Samantha step in with further process on MGP? David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, happy to. Good to talk to you, Todd. Look, we're in regular dialogue with the agencies. We started talking to them end of June, July of last year. And if it's not every other day, it's weekly or biweekly that we connect with the agencies to give them updates along the way. We updated them on the revolving credit facility. We updated them on the closing of the \u2013 or the consent solicitation of the shareholder votes. We've updated them on the closing of The Venetian yesterday. And they are waiting on final approvals, which Samantha can talk about. But they want a little bit of certainty that it's going to close. And we have no concerns that it will close, but the agencies just want to kind of be having a little bit more clarity around that. So it's a little bit of a chicken and the egg. But the body language of signals and everything that we've gotten is that it's all moving towards that date. The issue is none of us really know what that date is. And so with that, Samantha, I'll turn it over to you.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Thanks, David. I think just as we get into hurdles, not surprisingly, we won't speak about individual processes with the applicable jurisdictions. But we do continue to work through all jurisdictions. And again, I just want to reiterate that we remain confident in the first half closing.\nDavid Kieske: Okay. Sorry, just to make it a little bit more clear. I mean we do believe that once we get the approvals finalized, the agencies will be in a position to act quickly. And then once we go to the debt markets after that approval, we will be launching with the upgraded rating.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Got it. And then regarding the future capital raising initiatives, the $4.4 billion of permanent debt that you expect to raise, can you just remind us we're you expect to be on leverage on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis pro forma the closing? And also to the extent that \u2013 sorry, but just also to the extent that a Caesars asset or something else does present itself in the near term, do you have capacity to execute on something ahead of obtaining an investment-grade rating and closing MGP? Or should we assume that until that transaction closes, that there will not be any potential investment activity?\nDavid Kieske: Let's start with the pro forma leverage for The Venetian and for the MGP transaction. That will be \u2013 on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, our run rate is 5.8x net debt to EBITDA. And that's inside of the 6x. Specifically, S&P has targeted. That would give them confidence in upgrading us. As it relates to the funding or timing around a potential ROFR or other opportunities, I mean, that goes back to the dialogue that we've been having around. We will assess every option if the opportunity transaction that we're underwriting makes sense and is accretive for our shareholders. So it's not an either/or. And we've got the team and the capability to do potentially do both.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, I will now pass the conference back over to Edward Pitoniak of VICI. Ed?\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Amber.

            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, let me just say on behalf of VICI that our hearts very much go out this morning to the people of Ukraine. Today, I want to begin the call by addressing two topics: VICI's growth and total return over our first four years, and our closing of our Venetian acquisition and what it signifies about VICI and our asset class. I'll then turn the call over to John, who will talk about our ongoing growth initiatives; and to David, who will talk about our 2021 results and our financing activities. The year we just included 2021 constituted VICI's fourth full year of operations and growth. If measured from our emergence date in October 2017, a bit more than four years ago, we've accomplished following. We have announced $29 billion of acquisitions, establishing VICI as one of the most dynamic growth platforms in American REIT management. We have raised more than $12 billion of common equity, more than any other REIT in America over that period. Pro forma for our announced acquisitions, we will have grown our portfolio NOI by more than 4x. We have lowered our leverage from 8.5x adjusted EBITDA at emergence to 3.1x at the end of 2021, and moreover, transformed the right side of our balance sheet from entirely secured to substantially unsecured debt. And by transforming the magnitude and composition of our debt, we have put ourselves, we believe, on the cusp of investment-grade ratings. We've demonstrated the resilience of our assets and of our tenants through 100% on time [Audio Dip] to date. Most importantly, for VICI's stockholders, we generated from October 18, 2017, through December 31, 2021, a total return of 100.5%. This compares to the S&P 500 total return of 100.7% over that period and a total return for the RMZ of 58.9%, meaning VICI outperformed the RMZ over that period by 41.6 percentage points. Here is a simpler way of looking at it: $1 invested into VICI at the beginning of that period became $2, $1 invested into the RMZ over the same period became $1.59. An integral part of VICI's superior total return has been VICI's dividend growth over the period, with aggregate dividend per share growth of 37.1% since our first full quarter dividend payment in Q2 2018. We're proud of the value we've created over our first four years, but here's what we're really excited about today. We just closed yesterday on the acquisition of one of the most magnificent Class A assets in American commercial real estate, The Venetian. Let me reiterate the features we cited when we announced The Venetian transaction nearly a year ago. The Venetian is the single largest hotel complex in America with nearly 7,100 rooms. The Venetian is the largest private sector meeting convention trade show facility in America. At 13 million square feet of Class A quality, finding another building in America with more marble, we have brought The Venetian at a price per square foot of approximately $300, 82 acres of land that included an estimated 62% discount replacement cost. When we announced The Venetian acquisition in early March 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was still heavily and negatively impacting Las Vegas visitation and resort performance. Apollo, our new Venetian operating partner, and VICI were both mindful of that. And in a period when most potential Venetian buyers were not willing or able to come out into the heavy weather, VICI and Apollo were able to craft a transaction that protected against continuing uncertainty, but was fundamentally based in the belief that Las Vegas and moreover The Venetian would eventually return to 2019 levels of performance. What VICI and Apollo did not assume when we announced this transaction in March 2021 is that Las Vegas and The Venetian would over the ensuing 12 months stage a roaring comeback, achieving run rate profitability levels that are beyond 2019. Over the last 12 months, Rob Goldstein and Patrick Dumont's team at Las Vegas Sands, led by George Markantonis, have done a magnificent job of managing The Venetian. As LVS reported on January 26, The Venetian produced these eye-popping performance figures in Q4 2021, 100% occupancy of The Venetian's nearly 7,100 rooms and doing so without the full return of meeting convention trade show business. For the fourth quarter, The Venetian generated $154 million of adjusted property EBITDA and a margin of 34.5%. This amount of EBITDA annualized would mean over $600 million of run rate EBITDA before rent or nearly 2.5x coverage of our initial Venetian annual rent of $250 million. As for value, I just want to remind everyone that we have acquired The Venetian, again, one of the most magnificent and majestic Class A assets in American Commercial Real Estate at a cap rate of 6.25%, which we believe makes this one of the most compelling Class A single asset transactions in America REIT management in recent years. And if it isn't, someone you need to tell me what comped it. And here, as much work as I put into preparing these remarks, I actually \u2013 I have to quote one of you who posted last night this date, which I think says better than anything I've said, what we did in buying The Venetian, to quote simply put VICI got a pretty sweet deal. By looking past the short-term disruption in Las Vegas created by COVID, VICI was able to get one of the most iconic real estate assets in the country for a cap rate that today couldn't even buy you a well-located Dollar General. Finally, not only did we buy Venetian at a 6.25% cap rate, we have leased the Class A real estate of The Venetian to Apollo on a triple net basis with the superior economic transparency and integrity that the triple net lease model generally provides. And that highlights the final point I want to make about our first four years at VICI. Over this period, one can say that we have brought gaming real estate into the triple net lease sector. But I think what's more important is that we have brought the superiority of the triple net lease model to Class A real estate. Triple net real estate is sometimes criticized for being commodity real estate in low barrier-to-entry locations bought at a premium to replacement cost. Here is what we've done in VICI in our first four years in real estate investment terms. We've built America's biggest and best portfolio of differentiated non-commodity Class A experiential real estate in high-barrier-to-entry locations bought at substantial discounts to replacement cost. And here may be the most important portfolio attribute of all. Our real estate is occupied by, we believe, the best experiential operators in the world as evidenced by their market-leading resilience during the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic and their market-leading recovery to unprecedented levels of profitability. Thanks for bearing with me while I share my excitement for what we've done at VICI. And now I'll turn the call over to John Payne, who will share our excitement over what we're doing to continue to grow VICI. John? Yes. RJ, always good to chat with you. Net-net, it is unalloyed positive to have an institution of the quality and stature of Realty Income come in and validate our category. Realty Income goes back to 1969. They've built an amazing company. Samit has obviously continued to drive excellence at that company and drive very judicious allocation of capital, both categorically and geographically. So we've been saying, as John spoke of in his remarks, RJ, we've been saying since the beginning that this is an asset class that we believe is the next great institutionalization story in American commercial real estate. Well, institutionalization does not happen if institutions don't come into the category. And the more institutions to come into the category, the further institutionalized it is. There are puts and takes. You're absolutely right. When there's more competition, we have to work hard every single day to make sure that our cost of capital over the longer term, leaving aside the volatility we face in this current situation like this, but over time, we're improving the cost of capital on both an absolute and/or a relative basis at a velocity equal to the rate of cap rate compression. So again, net-net, we see it as very positive. And I think in this case, especially validating of regional assets, with the MGP transaction, we will be become the owners, the very proud owners of assets like National Harbor right on the Potomac River in D.C. We will become owners of the Borgata, of MGM Detroit, of Beau Rivage. These are assets that are absolutely in the same class as Encore Boston. And as John also alluded to in his remarks, if you look through the cap rate of Wynn Boston and what we are acquiring in MGP in terms of preeminent regional assets, we're obviously very happy with the revaluation that we believe our shareholders deserve. Samantha, you want to take timing and then David can talk financing? Yes. I'll take the last part of that, and I'll turn it over to John in terms of our ongoing energy around growth activities. Yes, you did see Tom Reeg announced last week his intentions to bring an asset to market. And obviously, we will take full advantage of the opportunity we have to get that very full first look and to see what possible advantages the addition of another asset could have and the addition of other relationships. But I just want to emphasize the fact that given obviously, not only the volatility in the market, but what are the hallmarked practices of great capital allocators, as a good real estate capital allocator, you never want the answer to the question of why did you buy that to be, well, it was for sale, right? I want to focus on somebody who had a great adage, which is, spent every dollar of capital like it's the last one you have.\" So whatever the opportunities may be, we will only allocate capital if we feel versus our other alternatives, it is the best use of capital at a given time. And then in terms of our ongoing growth activities, I'll turn it over to John. David? Thanks Wes. I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Greg. But you absolutely would have to ask Wynn why they did not run a process. Sumit Roy in Realty Income's earnings call yesterday, as you are implicitly referring to, clearly stated there was no process. And again, you're going to have to ask Wynn why did you not run a process. And above and beyond that, I don't know how much more we can or should say about the asset, given that we were not part of the process. But John, I'll hand it over to you to see what you might want to say. John? Greg, I would just add in regard to our property \u2013 partner property growth fund is that when the projects achieve the needed return hurdle and of course, our investments will be contingent upon them, clearly demonstrating that they can achieve that hurdle, we are in extremely attractive source of capital for our partners based on the cost of our capital. Because when the given investments can achieve the necessary hurdles, the cost of our capital should not be compared only to the cost of the debt capital of our partners. It really, given that we can, in many cases, alleviate them, the need for them to put in any incremental equity, the cost of our capital should be compared not again to the cost of their debt capital, but to their weighted average cost of capital, inclusive of both equity and debt. And on that basis, we become, again, a very compelling source of low-cost capital. John? Let me just add in regard to the 1.3 coverage, as David spoke about, these will go into the regional master lease. But we got comfortable when Tom Reeg closed that coverage level to us a few years ago based upon our confidence that the new Caesars under Tom's leadership would achieve corporate profitability levels that give us very strong corporate rent coverage, making us comfortable with the 1.3. Well, needless to say, Tom's team have greatly exceeded our expectations in terms of the corporate profitability there and will achieve at Caesars. And thus, again, to re-stress the point, why in this case at the asset level we were willing to take on that asset level coverage given what is proving to be rather magnificent corporate level rent coverage, which is part of a corporate rent guarantee. John? Barry, it's been a pretty wild four-years, right? I wouldn't bother naming the ball. But we had the interest rate kind of crack up of spring of 2018. We had December of 2018 which none of us hope we have to look through again anytime soon. We've obviously had March 2020. We have obviously learned to live and deal with volatility at VICI. And I think if taken one key lesson, it's that don't stop developing relationships in times of volatility because times of volatility will eventually come to an end. So to be honest with you, we just shut out the noise and we keep doing what we're doing. We obviously can't be heedless by any means of our cost of capital at any given time and have to take care to make sure we know where the money is going to come from and what the money is going to cost us. But again, I just want to re-emphasize the point that periods of volatility cannot be periods of dormancy in terms of our fundamental activity every single day, which is working to develop relationships, it will ultimately turn into deal flow. Thanks, Barry. Yes. Daniel, always good to hear from you. I may have mentioned this on prior earnings calls, but one of the things I am struck by within gaming, generally in gaming real estate specifically, is we have not yet come up with a widely accepted hierarchy of quality classification, right? As many of you know, I used to work in the hotel sector, where there's a clearly accepted \u2013 well, there's a few clearly accepted hierarchies of quality, whether it's based on Star five, four, three, two so on and so forth, or whether it's luxury, upper upscale and so on and so forth. Well, that categorization does not yet exist in games. Really doesn't exist so much on the strip. And it definitely doesn't exist in regional. So if you were to try to impose a hierarchy of quality on regional gaming, there is a highest level of regional gaming asset quality that would include assets like Encore Boston, National Harbor, MGM Detroit Borgata, Beau Rivage, Caesars New Orleans, especially after the Caesars team puts in the capital that they're about to spend, Harrah's Atlantic City. There is this higher tier of assets, and Encore Boston has set a new benchmark cap rate for the highest tier regional assets. And usually, when the top category in an asset class establishes a new benchmark in terms of lower cap rates, there can and usually is a slip stream effect on the lower quality \u2013 lower categories of quality. So I guess maybe your implicit question, does Encore Boston create a slip stream not only for the highest end regional properties, which we will be the market leader in owning, but will it also create a upstream for other regional assets? And we believe it would because again, you look at the resiliency through COVID. If you look at the indispensability of the asset to the operator, you look at the barriers to entry, if you look at all of the classic real estate valuation metrics and frameworks, you have to concede these are really good assets, and they are woefully underpriced. David, do you want to take that? Thank you, Daniel. Yes. Michael, it is a profound and extremely important question. It is one David and I especially have been wrestling with really going back to last fall, soon after we raised the equity for MGP, which we did use yesterday for The Venetian, but that's all because of the fungibility of cash. Yes, it's a profound question. And I would say that our strategy going forward, having done the transformative deals we've done, Venetian to a degree, but especially MGP is that having achieved the scale we've achieved, having in place some of the built-in growth elements that we do have, we really want to begin to develop more of a flow model. We want gaming and nongaming to achieve the cadence of deal flow that is both more sustained, simple. And accordingly, we want our fundraising activities to be, frankly, less gargantuan. You are absolutely right. It's been a slog since, well, especially since late summer. We actually won in late summer was pretty much the week of Labor Day, things will earn and then that happened to be we raised the equity for MGP. And we're glad we did it when we did Michael, and we do thank the Citi team for their help in doing so. And we realized that, that sheer amount of equity, $5.5 billion in 2021 did have a weighty effect on the performance of our stock. And we really appreciate the patience of our shareholders. We were very pleased to see the [indiscernible] how steady our core shareholders remain through the turbulence of Q4. And we're hopeful that, that is still prove to be the case here in Q1. Going forward, we do want to create a business model that is sustained and sustainable and lessens on these kinds of gargantuan equity raises. I hope that gets to the core of the question you were asking. Yes. So just to be clear, we do not need to raise any further equity for MGP. We have raised all the equity we need. We will be raising only debt. We will obviously have a share exchange on a fixed exchange ratio with the MGP shareholders, including MGM. So there's no equity further needs for MGP. And when it comes to a ROFR or any other opportunity, again, just to re-emphasize the point, we're very mindful of the fact that we need to consider every possible way of funding such opportunities if and only if they're compellingly accretive for our shareholders. And it will be our bias to not have to raise our grants to an amount of equity because we're very conscious of the fact that we need to give our shareholders understood broadly a chance to realize that revaluation that they deserve, and it will be easier to achieve if we do not go out into the market and raise a little ton of equity to use the technical term. Yes. We are looking at all those things. And maybe I'll just turn it over to David quickly, and he can talk about the way in which we are going to very strategically use the amount of retained cash that we will be building up given our payout ratio, David? Yes. Michael, I think Realty Income and VICI are fairly different companies running different kinds of rent roles, running different kinds of risks. I think I saw in Samit's [ph] remarks that their weighted average lease term at this point is 14 years. Ours is 43.5 years. So given that delta in just, for example, weighted average lease terms, things that report to us like the magnitude of rent escalation, like the magnitude of CapEx, maybe more important to us than to Samit were Wynn will represent \u2013 I think Encore will represent 3% of its rent rule. I think we both have different levers. We both have \u2013 we both run different profiles. So what would be really important to us, maybe it's not important to him. Well, obviously one right now that's very, very critical is some measure of CPI protection. And correct me if I'm wrong, but once we achieve CPI protection in our MGM lease, and Danny step in Europe of getting this call, 90% will have BPI protection built into it. And needless to say, we've always thought that to be important, Michael. But it feels really much more important right now than it did 1 year or two ago. I'm sorry, Michael, that broke up. We do in some leases. We don't in others. The Caesars leases are uncapped, which is why we posted a 5.0-odd percent rent increase on November 1 out of the Caesars Las Vegas lease. Yes indeed. Looking forward to it. Operator, we will take one more question. David, why don't you start with the time line and maybe Samantha step in with further process on MGP? David? Yes. Thanks, David. I think just as we get into hurdles, not surprisingly, we won't speak about individual processes with the applicable jurisdictions. But we do continue to work through all jurisdictions. And again, I just want to reiterate that we remain confident in the first half closing. Thank you, Amber. And in closing, we want to thank all of you for your engagement with us this morning. As you can tell, we're very excited about our present situation, our near-term opportunities and our long-term prospects. And we look forward to chatting with you again when we report our first quarter results. Thank you, everyone. Bye for now."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning everyone. 2021 sure was another successful and transformative year for VICI as we announced over $21 billion of transactions, solidifying our position as the number one experiential REIT in terms of acquisition volume, significantly increasing our scale and furthering our credibility as one of America's blue-chip REITs. As Ed said, we are very happy to announce that the acquisition of Venetian Las Vegas closed yesterday. And our acquisition of MGP remains on track to close in the first half of this year. Since we announced the acquisition of The Venetian, we witnessed cap rate compression in Las Vegas seemingly in real time, with City Center trading at a 5.5% cap rate and The Cosmopolitan at a 4.97% cap. Additionally, since our announced acquisition of MGP, regional cap rates have continued to compress, with Encore Boston Harbor, a large-scale, high-quality urban assets recently trading at a cap rate in the high 5s. We have been pounding the table about the quality of gaming real estate and its superior investment characteristics relative to many real estate asset classics \u2013 classes since our formation. We believe that in many ways, the most recent trading cap rates are directly applicable to the value of the assets in our portfolio. It is gratifying to see our thesis come to fruition. And we believe there is much more to come as gaming real estate becomes a mainstream real estate asset class. Upon closing our MGP transaction, we believe we will have a portfolio of assets with quality unmatched by any other leisure real estate portfolio. Our rental streams and underlying asset cash flow durability has proven through the \u2013 has been proven through the pandemic. We have tenant relationships with industry-leading operators who utilize extensive CRM capabilities to be engaged with the consumers. And as many of you know these capabilities, combined with our tenants' operational expertise, has led to record profitability in Las Vegas and across the region. Now as we think about VICI's future growth prospects, we see a long runway for growth within gaming. Many operators continue to study and understand how VICI's capital can be utilized in their capital stack and we have regular dialogue with a number of public and private operators that continue to own their real estate. Additionally, we've started allocating capital towards other leisure verticals, which we believe will round out our investments over time. We will approach additional leisure investments in a prudent manner by studying the opportunities and market dynamics in detail and perform an appropriate diligence and risk-reward analysis prior to allocating capital on behalf of our shareholders. One of our fundamental goals as a company is to grow earnings per share accretively on behalf of our shareholders. We believe this aligns our success with the interest of our shareholders and we do not approach investments blindly in order to just satisfy investment volumes or other arbitrary measurements. To that end, I will repeat the pillars that we believe will drive accretive growth for VICI and create value for our shareholders well into the future. We will strive to execute the compelling opportunities in our embedded growth pipeline. We will study and evaluate open-market gaming transactions in the United States and internationally. We will partner with existing tenants under our property growth fund through which we will seek to fund high-return growth projects at our existing properties and we will allocate resources towards studying leisure and experiential investments as well as large-scale M&A opportunities. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and our financial results. David? Yes. Good morning, Wes. As you know, these deals don't happen over the first month. So we're very active, continuing to talk to the operators on the gaming side as we had since we started the company. And we're spending, as I said in my remarks, quite a bit of time in what we call the hospitality or experiential space, sitting down with C-suite executives of certain companies in certain industries explaining how our capital could help them grow and we could be partners over time. So we're very active. And as Ed said, we'll be very prudent in the way that we put out our capital. I think we've already said it. Look, it's a great validation of the value of our real estate, right? I mean if you take National Harbor, there's an asset as good a quality, I'd even say it's better quality, right? And so the cap rate that's put on that asset really just the validation of what we've been talking about for four-years when we started this company. Well, we're having active conversations with all our tenants about opportunities where they can use our capital to grow, we can gain incremental rent over time. I'm not a big guy who tells you, predicts what exactly we're going to do. But what I can tell you is this fund has been well received by our tenants. And I think there are some large projects, growth projects in the future that I believe will be a part of with our tenants. And it will be exciting to be \u2013 exciting to help them grow and be excited to help us grow. I'll let David talk a little bit about the structure. I'll talk about the assets. First of all, they're just great assets. They're big. They're growing. As you touched on, Caesars just rebranded the asset, one of the assets in Indianapolis to a horseshoe. They're investing large chunks of capital into both of the businesses there as table games was legalized at these casinos. And so these assets have not only grown under the Caesars' leadership, they will continue to grow as these assets get the capital and then stabilize. So we're continuing to watch it. We think these are going to be great additions to our portfolio. And then David can tell you a little bit how the deal was structured and how it would enter into our master lease. David? And I just want to add one thing to what David said that I don't want to make sure it's lost. We have the right to call this at a 7.7% cap. And there was a transaction that just happened in the regional markets for a 5.9% cap. I'll take that, Barry. I'll answer it more in there's areas of opportunity where we'd like to own real estate. If you think of the Las Vegas market, which I know, Barry, you follow closely, you look at the regional performers there, how well they've performed during before the pandemic and after the pandemic or as they were coming out of the pandemic. We don't own any real estate in Downtown Las Vegas. If you see how Circa has changed that market and the way people think about that market, Tillman and his team have done a great job there for years. So if there's an opportunity on real estate in the Downtown Las Vegas market, which is a big market. We don't own assets in Reno, Colorado, Rhode Island. We don't have Pittsburgh, like Charles, others. So there's still quite a few gaming markets that we don't own assets. And as we talked earlier, we've got a ROFRs here on another Las Vegas asset. So many opportunities for us. Haven't had opportunities where I'm saying I wouldn't go into, but I'm sure there's a few we feel like we've got enough real estate. But I really want to answer that where we see that there's continued opportunity."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2021 continued the relentless focus we have maintained over our four plus years of existence on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. This disciplined focus was rewarded during 2021 by: first, the depth of the support from the equity capital markets to derisk the equity funding for our $21 billion of announced acquisitions; and second, from the culmination of one of our most important objectives since emergence, and that is to finally transform our balance sheet into an unsecured borrower. As Ed mentioned, we believe we are on the cusp of achieving an investment-grade rating. To recap, as we look back at 2021, in March, we raised $2 billion of equity through a $69 million share forward sale agreement. In September, we raised $3.4 billion of equity through a 65 million share regular way offering and a 50 million share forward sale agreement. Raising $5.4 billion of equity is not something we take for granted, and we greatly appreciate the support of our equity holders to be able to derisk the equity funding and take advantage of two unique opportunities that presented themselves during the year. The September offering, in fact, was recognized by International Financing Review, or IFR, as the North America secondary equity issue of the year. We are thankful to our underwriters led by Morgan Stanley as well as a full syndicate of banks, for the support to be able to execute the largest common equity follow-on ever by a REIT. In September, we fully repaid our $2.1 billion secured term loan. This was a critical step on our path towards investment grade. Also in September, we announced the successful early participation in the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the $4.2 billion of outstanding MGP notes. As a result, upon closing of the MGP transaction, the covenants under the existing MGP indentures will be aligned with the covenants, restrictions and events of default under the existing VICI indentures. In December, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $500 million. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into three additional agreements with a notional amount of $1.5 billion. The interest rate swap transactions, so far totaling $2 billion, are intended to reduce the variability in the interest expense related to the debt we expect to incur with the closing of the MGP acquisition. In addition, subsequent to year-end, we closed on a new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a $1 billion delayed draw term loan, increasing our overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital. The revolver maturity runs to March of 2026 before extension options with grid-based pricing. Based on the company's current credit ratings, the revolving credit facility bears interest at SOFR plus 132.5 basis points, an improvement in pricing from 200 basis points over LIBOR under our prior secured revolving credit facility. Just to recap The Venetian funding, which we closed yesterday. We settled the March and September outstanding forward sale agreements, bringing 119 million shares onto our balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. We drew $600 million on our revolver with the remaining proceeds coming from cash to close the $4 billion Venetian acquisition. I also want to highlight that the settlement of the two forward sale agreements will all but eliminate the outsized short interest that VICI has been subject to. As of January 31st, we had approximately 85 million shares of short interest, which the majority was from the mechanics of the forward sale agreements. To summarize 2021 and the events at the start of 2022 highlighted our guiding principles on how we approach our balance sheet, which are to maintain a long-term target leverage goal of 5 to 5.5 on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis; maintain an unsecured capital structure and an unencumbered asset pool; pursue a disciplined composition and laddering of fixed rate debt, safeguarding the company's balance sheet against future market volatility; opportunistically accessing the capital markets to lock in funding certainty for all transactions and ultimately achieving an investment-grade rating. We have been relentless in our drive towards an investment-grade rating and we believe the actions we took during 2021 and at the start of 2022 should position VICI to be able to access the investment-grade market when we seek to raise the $4.4 billion of permitted debt required to redeem the MGM OP units at the time of closing the MGP transactions, all while continuing to maintain ample liquidity, flexibility and optionality to grow accretively. Turning to the income statement. AFFO for the fourth quarter was $278.9 million, or $0.44 per share, bringing full year 2021 AFFO to $1.0474 billion, or $1.82 per share. Total AFFO in 2021 increased 25.3% year-over-year while AFFO per share increased approximately 11% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count and resulting temporary dilution from the March and September forward equity offerings. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 12.9% primarily as the result of the settlements of the June 2020 forward sale agreement in September of 2021, which added 26.9 million shares to our balance sheet in the regular way portion of the September offering, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet. The proceeds from both of these offerings were used to repay the $2.1 billion secured term loan in September. We refer you to our press release where we've added two tables detailing our outstanding common shares and a reconciliation of the weighted average shares of common stock used in the calculation of earnings per share. These tables are on Page 5 of our release that was posted to our website last night. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $9 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenue was only 2.4%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Finally, I want to touch on our leverage. We ended 2021 with net debt-to-EBITDA of 3.1x and pro forma for The Venetian closing, our net debt-to-EBITDA is 3x. This highlights the fact that we have significantly over-equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the MGP acquisition, positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt required to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction. As I touch on guidance, this will be important. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions, specifically the pending acquisition of MGP or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. As we have discussed, we record a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which is due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. Our guidance incorporates the recently closed Venetian acquisition and the settlement of the 119 million shares that were subject to the March and September forward sale agreements. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2022, will be between $1.317 billion and $1.347 billion or between $1.80 and $1.84 per diluted share. The midpoint of our total AFFO guidance on an absolute dollars represents an increase of 27.2% versus our 2021 actual AFFO. On a per share basis, guidance reflects all of the equity raise to close the transactions we announced in 2021. And thus, the corresponding increase in VICI's share count without the benefit of the corresponding income from the pending MGP transaction. Accordingly, we expect to update guidance in the future to reflect the impact of the MGP transaction when we are in a position to do so. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Thanks. RJ, as it relates to the debt markets, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've built a $2 billion hedge portfolio to start to minimize the volatility that we're witnessing, obviously, real time today. One of the aspects \u2013 a couple of the aspects that we have going forward is when we underwrote The Venetian as well as MGP, we underwrote that in the high-yield markets. And with the work that our team has done with the agencies and as we mentioned in our remarks, we feel very confident that we'll be issuing debt into the investment-grade market when we can do so and once we're positioned through regulatory approval, which Samantha just alluded to. So our underwriting remains in line with what we underwrote originally even with the uptick in rates. And obviously, today is a unique day with the volatility going out on in the markets. But for 10-year pricing, we're getting quotes in the high-100, low-200 over treasury for 10-year paper. So on a blended basis, we still feel good about our overall accretion and everything that we laid out for you back in August of last year. Yes. Wes, I mean, we're going to look at alternatives that are in front of us. As it relates to recycling assets, I mean, that's not \u2013 we have recycled an asset in Atlantic City, asset in Reno, we just in our release, we sold Louisiana Downs. So potentially, there could be that opportunity. There could be potential JV opportunities. You've obviously seen MGP joint venture, some assets in the past. And then the attractiveness of a REIT and the ability to issue OP units that we are doing directly to MGM, GLPI is doing that to Cordis. So there's other avenues of equity. As it relates to taking leverage up, we're pretty disciplined with our dialogue with the agencies of our goal. We've gotten a path to take leverage up to six times. When you take leverage up and that's just financial engineering to drive accretion, and that's something that we strive to do. So we'll stay within our guidepost. But I think there's other tools in the toolbox that we can bring to the table to, as John said, pursue opportunities that we're in dialogue with. Sure. Thanks, John. as you referenced, that put call started January 1 of this year. It runs to December 31, 2024. We can call those two assets at a 7.7% cap, or Tom and team can put them to us at an 8% cap. It's an LTM coverage ratio that was set at 1.3 times. Part of the reason we agreed to that within the broader funding of Eldorado acquisition at Caesars is that those assets will go into the regional master lease. And those are two very attractive assets, as John alluded to, and something that we'll assess how we sequence that into our growth and the cadence that we have internally with everything else going on over the period of time. But just given where cap rates have gone, we're very excited to potentially own those assets at some point here. Sure. Dan, nice to talk to you. I mean as we look outside the U.S., we look most simplistically what's readable and what is a good rule logo, obviously, good real estate, but good tax jurisdictions and things jurisdictions like Canada, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Europe, UK. Less \u2013 maybe less so gaming in the Europe, UK, just given the nature of the \"boxes.\" But we talked about realty income here a lot going into gaming. They've obviously gone into Spain and Europe and other jurisdictions. You've seen other REITs like Simon go abroad. So there are opportunities that we're looking at and assessing across the globe. And as we continue to grow, we've got the infrastructure and the expertise to do so. And we look to continue to develop those opportunities and ultimately bring those sorts of opportunities into our portfolio over time. Yes. Thanks, Ed and Michael, always good to talk to you. I mean even just taking a step back when we went into the MGP transaction in June, July, August, we assessed all options around how do navigate what is ultimately a significant capital raise, I mean, $3.4 billion of equity. And that's something we took lightly and something that we had a lot of other levers that we could have potentially pulled, and we were able to obviously execute that with everybody's help. But as we closed MGP here, and Samantha said the first half of the year and then is moving along very well, you get to kind of a run rate of roughly $2 billion of AFFO \u2013 feedback, take 75% of that out for dividends, you've got roughly $500 million of free cash flow. And that is true free cash flow. As you know, we have no CapEx. We have our G&A is our G&A. There's not a lot of other items that need to come out of that free cash flow. So if you lever that 2:1, that's $1 billion of buying power that we have internally to continue to deliver the growth that we've delivered since day one. Yes, happy to. Good to talk to you, Todd. Look, we're in regular dialogue with the agencies. We started talking to them end of June, July of last year. And if it's not every other day, it's weekly or biweekly that we connect with the agencies to give them updates along the way. We updated them on the revolving credit facility. We updated them on the closing of the \u2013 or the consent solicitation of the shareholder votes. We've updated them on the closing of The Venetian yesterday. And they are waiting on final approvals, which Samantha can talk about. But they want a little bit of certainty that it's going to close. And we have no concerns that it will close, but the agencies just want to kind of be having a little bit more clarity around that. So it's a little bit of a chicken and the egg. But the body language of signals and everything that we've gotten is that it's all moving towards that date. The issue is none of us really know what that date is. And so with that, Samantha, I'll turn it over to you. Okay. Sorry, just to make it a little bit more clear. I mean we do believe that once we get the approvals finalized, the agencies will be in a position to act quickly. And then once we go to the debt markets after that approval, we will be launching with the upgraded rating. Let's start with the pro forma leverage for The Venetian and for the MGP transaction. That will be \u2013 on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, our run rate is 5.8x net debt to EBITDA. And that's inside of the 6x. Specifically, S&P has targeted. That would give them confidence in upgrading us. As it relates to the funding or timing around a potential ROFR or other opportunities, I mean, that goes back to the dialogue that we've been having around. We will assess every option if the opportunity transaction that we're underwriting makes sense and is accretive for our shareholders. So it's not an either/or. And we've got the team and the capability to do potentially do both."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, October 28, 2021.  I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, in our third quarter 2021 earnings release and our supplemental information.  Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2021 was the most active and transformational quarter in our 4-year history at VICI. The highlight of our quarter of our year-to-date, of our history to date was our announcement on August 4 of our acquisition of MGP's market-leading assets and our new long-term partnership with MGM Resorts, who're one of the foremost leisure, hospitality entertainment companies in the world. Together with our March 3rd announcement of our Venetian acquisition, 2021 has been a step change year for VICI. So far in 2021, we've signed over $21 billion of transaction activity, giving us nearly $30 billion of acquisition activity in our first 4 years. And to fund that growth we have over the last 4 years, raised more primary common equity proceeds than any other REIT in America. We have a strong conviction that our energetic and execution-driven strategy over our first 4 years will, over the long term, create significant value for our equity and credit owners. We believe that there are 3 key factors that drive and validate our strategy. Factor 1, invest before others do. As an asset class institutionalizes, investing earlier rather than later, generally will yield opportunities to buy institutional quality assets at pre-institutional pricing. While other investors have begun initiating their mapping of the gaming real estate investment landscape, VICI and I should note, Blackstone have been busy buying great assets at unlevered going-in cash flow yields that are superior in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms than can be found in already institutionalized asset classes. This isn't to say that there aren't compelling investment opportunities still to be had in American gaming real estate. There definitely are as the sector's real estate is still not yet even 40% owned by REITs. But while others are getting starting on their homework, VICI has built market-leading proprietary ownership positions along with one of the most economically productive streets in America, the Las Vegas Strip. And VICI will also have built the largest and by far the highest quality regional portfolio in American gaming real estate once we close our MGP acquisition.  Factor 2, invest when others are fearful or uncertain. We began our 2021 acquisition work in late 2020 when most real estate investors were still understandably unsure about leaving the harbor and going out on to the blue water to fish. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was stormy in late 2020 and stayed stormy well into 2021. But at VICI we're willing to venture out onto the blue water because of our conviction that COVID have proven the durability of our asset class and the market-leading resilience of our operating partners. We've announced over $21 billion of acquisition activity in 2021 because of that conviction and in doing so, preempted any risk of being incomparable Venetian and the best-in-class MGP portfolio being bid to the skies when everybody was finally ready to come out onto the blue water with us. Factor 3, invest alongside great partners when given the chance. Many investors understandably questioned VICI's strategy when in late 2019 we announced our intention to support Eldorado's acquisition of Caesars with what ultimately became $3.6 billion of VICI Capital. We were constantly asked throughout 2019 and well into 2020. Can the Eldorado guys really achieve that $500 million of synergies, can they manage so much bigger an organization? Can they produce sufficient free cash flow and rent coverage? Will they have access to capital? Well, when we put our money behind Tom Reeg, Bret Yunker, Anthony Carano and the rest of the Caesars team, we are very confident that they would deliver, and you all know by now, without question, as they appear to have delivered far beyond everyone's expectations.  Similarly, when earlier this year, we began competing for the MGP portfolio, our determination to win was greatly energized by our conviction that Bill Hornbuckle, Jonathan Halkyard, Corey Sanders and the MGM team are growing MGM into one of the most dynamic and innovative brand and operating platforms in the global consumer discretionary sector. Our nearly $30 billion of announced investments over our first 4 years have enabled us to partner with great operators across the U.S., not only MGM and Caesars, but also with Apollo on the Venetian, with Hard Rock, Penn, JACK, Century, The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf and ClubCorp. All our current operators, every one of them is delivering top life performance in global leisure and hospitality right now. And the secular outlook for our gaming partners, if you're brighter, than one can find in almost any other category because of the audience expansion tailwind that sports betting represents. To repeat these 3 key factors that have driven our strategy in our actions, factor 1, grow fast in the early stages of institutionalization; factor 2, grow and others are uncertain, under willing or underfunded; factor 3, grow with great partners. VICI's activity in our first 4 years, driven by these 3 key growth factors distilled down to this. Before other institutional real estate investors are ready to do so, we've built a portfolio of Class A real estate of incomparable scale and quality and significant discounts to replacement cost and significant discounts to other institutional real estate categories of similar asset and income quality. And in doing so, we've created a network and partner relationships that will be a key source of growth for us for many years to come.  Now to talk about our growth outlook, I'll turn the call over to John Payne. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. During the third quarter of 2021, we continue to execute the market-leading growth many of you have come to expect from VICI. The announcement of our $17.2 billion acquisition of MGM Growth Properties brings our total investment, as Ed said, to nearly $30 billion in 48 months. As I'm sure many of you can appreciate, this degree of activity does not come without hard work, dedication and relentless desire to succeed. As a management team, we are incredibly thankful for the hard work of our exceptional colleagues at what we call Team VICI, without whom many of our accomplishments to date would not be possible. As I've said before, VICI does not go on vacation or wait for the phone to ring after announcing or closing a transaction. Our primary day-to-day operations consist of sourcing, underwriting and funding accretive acquisitions. To that end, we are as busy as we've ever been building our pipeline and meeting with talented business owners and management teams to discuss how VICI can be an efficient source of capital and play a role in funding their growth plan. As we look forward, we will strive to execute across the many growth pillars we believe will make VICI as a stronger company while driving accretive AFFO per share growth for shareholders. Those growth pillars include executing transactions within our embedded growth pipeline, open market gaming transactions in the United States and internationally, our property growth fund through which we will fund high-return growth projects at our properties for existing tenant partners and leisure and experiential investments as well as continued large-scale M&A. There's never been a more exciting time to be investing across the gaming universe and Las Vegas in particular. Operationally, fundamentals are strong, and the casino operators continue to have a robust outlook for their properties. Margin expansion remains sticky, and the industry continues to post very impressive financial results. For example, some of you on this call may have noticed that just last week, Las Vegas Sands reported a record third quarter at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, with adjusted property EBITDA of $132 million, 97% hotel occupancy in the quarter and robust forward group bookings from 2022 through 2027. All of these results occurred in the third quarter that had very limited convention and meeting business and almost no international travel. Since we've announced the acquisition of Venetian Real Estate for a 6.25% cap rate, we have witnessed cap rate compression firsthand on the Las Vegas Strip. First, with the real estate of ARIA and VDARA, and City Center trading for a 5.5% cap rate; and most recently, just about a month ago with the Cosmopolitan\u2019s real estate trading just under a 5% cap rate or a 20.1x rent multiple. We have been among the biggest and the most vocal believers in Las Vegas since we started VICI and it's very gratifying to witness institutional capital enter the sector. VICI will continue to be at the forefront of gaming real estate, investing in assets in markets where we believe institutionalization is poised to occur.  In closing, we believe the outlook for growth is very promising and the transformation of our balance sheet, which David will touch on, positions us for continued success as we approach an investment-grade credit rating. And upon closing of our pending acquisition transactions, we\u2019ll emerge with a pro forma enterprise value that is approximately $45 billion, which is significantly larger than most of our direct REIT competitors.  Now, I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and additional investments outside of gaming. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet and highlight what was our most significant quarter in terms of advancing our long-term strategic financial goals. As you've heard me say, since emergence, we have maintained a relentless focus on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. The initiatives we undertook in connection with the MGP acquisition further strengthened our capital structure and position VICI for continued year-in, year-out growth. And in connection with the announcement of the MGP transaction on August 4, we received extremely positive feedback from the rating agencies and just to read a snippet from the report that S&P released. The acquisition will improve VICI's scale and tenant diversity such that it could support a greater level of leverage at a higher rating if the company finances the acquisition with a mix of equity and debt that leads to pro forma leverage of about 6x or below and we could raise our rating to BBB minus. That's great news, and I will touch on leverage in a moment. On September 14, we completed the largest REIT common only equity offering ever, issuing 115 million shares of common stock at an offering price of $29.50 for aggregate proceeds of $3.4 billion. 65 million shares were sold via regular offering, raising $1.9 billion and 50 million shares are subject to forward sale agreements. This offering derisks the equity funding for the MGP transaction and positions the balance sheet to be below the leverage ratios dictated by the rating agencies to migrate the balance sheet to an investment-grade issuer. On September 15, we were thrilled to eliminate all outstanding secured debt in our current capital stack with a repayment of the secured $2.1 billion term loan. We used $526.9 million of proceeds from the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement on September 9 as well as a portion of the proceeds from the September equity offering to repay the term loan. In connection with this pay off, we also settled the outstanding interest rate swaps, incurring breakage costs of $64.2 million. This one-time amount is reflected in interest expense for the quarter, reducing net income and FFO but is added back to arrive at AFFO. On September 27, we announced a successful early participation in the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the $4.2 billion of outstanding MGP notes. As a result, upon closing of the MGP transaction, the covenants under the existing MGP indentures will be aligned with the covenants, restrictions and events of defaults under the VICI indentures.  Our outstanding total debt at quarter end was $4.8 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.3 years, and we have no debt maturing until 2024. And as of September 30, our net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA was 3.1x. We currently have approximately $4.9 billion in liquidity, comprised of $669.5 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. In addition, we have approximately $1.9 billion in net proceeds available from the March 2021 forward sale agreements and approximately $1.4 billion in net proceeds from the September 2021 forward sale agreements, which we intend to use to fund a portion of the Venetian acquisition. And since our formation just a little over 4 years ago, we have been relentless in our drive towards an investment-grade rating, and we believe the actions we took during the quarter should position VICI to be able to access the investment-grade market when we seek to raise the $4.4 billion of permanent debt required to redeem the MGM Op units at the time of the closing of the MGP transaction. Now turning to the quarter. We once again, continue to expand our partnerships outside of gaming by announcing a strategic arrangement with ClubCorp, an Apollo portfolio company related to Big Shot Golf. On September 15, we agreed to provide up to $80 million of mortgage financing to fund the development of 5 Big Shot Golf facilities across the U.S. As part of the arrangement, VICI will have a call right to acquire the real estate assets associated with any Big Shot Golf facility financed by VICI in a sale leaseback. In addition, we have a ROFO on future debt financing, Big Shot Golf -- and future financing Big Shot Golf seeks for any multistate development of their extensive pipeline of facilities.  Over the past 2 quarters, we have announced strategic with leading leisure and hospitality operators and we believe our relationships with Apollo and Blackstone demonstrate our ability to forge mutually beneficial partnerships that enhance our diversification and growth prospects. We're thrilled to partner with Big Shots and expand our relationship with Apollo and continue to look forward to a great partnership with Blackstone and the team at Great Wolf Resorts. In terms of financial results, net income and FFO was $161.9 million for the quarter or $0.28 per share compared to $398.3 million or $0.74 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to a $333.4 million one-time noncash gain upon lease modification that occurred in the third quarter of '20, a $79.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt and interest rate swap terminations in the current quarter and the $168 million noncash decrease in the Q3 '20 versus the Q3 '21 change in the CECL allowance. AFFO was $257.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 12.9% over Q3 of 2020. And just as a reminder, our diluted share count includes the impact of treasury accounting during the period of time the forward sale agreements are in place. During the third quarter, the impact of treasury accounting on our diluted share count was approximately 15.7 million shares. We refer you to our press release where we have added 2 tables detailing our outstanding common shares and a reconciliation of the weighted average shares of common stock used in the calculation of earnings per share. These tables are on Page 6 of our release that was posted to our website last night. In terms of our dividend, on August 4, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, which is a 9.1% increase compared to the Q2 dividend. The Q3 dividend was paid on October 7 to stockholders of record as of September 24.  And finally, we are updating our AFFO guidance for the full year 2021 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As we have discussed, beginning in January of 2020, we are required to implement the CECL accounting standard, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and AFFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021, to be between $1.40 billion and $1.45 billion, representing an increase of $20 million in total AFFO from the prior guidance midpoint. Our revised 2021 full year AFFO per share guidance is $1.79 to $1.80 per diluted share, which is approximately $0.05 below the midpoint of prior guidance on a per share basis and is below the current consensus of $1.83 per share, which reflects certain analyst assumptions on the timing -- around the timing and closing and funding of the Venetian transaction, which are not included in our guidance estimates. The reduction in guidance reflects the dilutive effect of the addition of 26.9 million shares from the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement and the 65 million shares issued in the September 2021 equity offering and a dilutive impact as calculated under the treasury stock method of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forward sale agreements and the pending 50 million shares related to the September 2021 forward sale agreements. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from Baird.\nWesley Golladay: Can you talk about what caused the pushout of the Venetian from, I guess, closing later this year -- or later this year until 1Q '22?\nEdward Pitoniak: Samantha, you want to take that?\nSamantha Gallagher: Yes. Hi. As you know, there's regulatory approvals that are required for the operator in connection with that transaction. So the operator, Apollo here is just going through the regulatory process.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. I guess is there any read-through to timing of the MGP transaction?\nSamantha Gallagher: Did you -- I'm sorry, did you ask if there's any update to the timing? We can...\nWesley Golladay: Well, I guess, is there any read-through -- would there be any issues that are causing the Venetian to be pushed out with those things apply to MGP as well?\nSamantha Gallagher: No. They are unrelated and we do not expect that to impact our previously disclosed timing for the MGP transaction.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then one last one. I guess, can you update us on the Las Vegas master lease, I think, is going to be set in a few days?\nSamantha Gallagher: David or Danny?\nDavid Kieske: Danny, go ahead.\nDanny Valoy: Yes, Wes, in terms of escalations, we expect that to escalate in with CPI, which was about 5%, so of the 2% floor that's embedded in that lease. So starting November 1 for the next lease year, the Las Vegas master lease will escalate about 5%.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan from Raymond James.\nRJ Milligan: Can you talk about the JACK lease amendment that was just announced? And do you see any other opportunities for additional amendments dropping the variable rent component for some of the other leases?\nEdward Pitoniak: David, or Samantha, you want to take that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, RJ, I can start and Samantha chime in on anything. I mean what we're experiencing and witnessing is just continued -- somewhat of a confirmation or conforming aspect of the leases, right? This sector is only 8 years old with the formation of GLPI in 2013. But as each deal, we and the operators continue to get smarter and understand the best way to document and structure a lease. And so when some of these opportunities arise to remove some of the legacy component, so to speak, of leases that really don't make sense for you as the operator or us as landlord, we work collaboratively together to streamline the leases and continue to move forward to somewhat of a \"industry standard\". So it's a net-net win for both sides here with between VICI and JACK.\nRJ Milligan : Okay. And then looking into '22, can you give us an update on your thoughts on executing some of the ROFRs or the put call options that you guys have?\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: So we continue to monitor. I think you're referring to -- first, we have some ROFRs in Las Vegas. Tom Reeg, the CEO of Caesars has indicated that they would be looking to potentially sell one of the assets and we'll be involved in that process and we'll follow his lead on what they're deciding to do. And then the second one, I think you're referring to is our put call that we have that becomes live in January '22 with the 2 large assets in Indianapolis, and we'll continue to monitor those as well. Those assets continue to grow, RJ, since we did this -- created this put call table games have been legalized at the racinos in the State of Indiana, and Caesars has been working on expanding those facilities. And those so -- those facilities are continuing to add amenities, add some space, add table games. And so we'll watch how they continue to grow. And we know that, that put call is good for 3 years starting in January.\nRJ Milligan : Okay. And then my last question is a bigger picture question. But Ed, it seems like there's still a disconnect for regional gaming assets in terms of pricing and we started to see the cap rate compression in Las Vegas for sure. When do you expect or what do you think needs to happen to start seeing cap rate compression in the regional markets?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, RJ. It is, I believe -- or I think it will prove to be a dynamic that we've seen in other asset classes that have gone through institutionalization as an example, a category that I spent time in final mile logistics. When there began to be an institutionalization of that industrial sub-asset class, the greatest amount of investment focused initially was in markets like the Inland Empire outside of L.A. and Northern New Jersey. And as the category really began to prove itself that as the secular trends behind the category continue to grow, what you began to see was a radiating out of investment activity from those epicenters. As an example, across the street from our JACK Thistledown asset outside of Cleveland, on a site that once how, I guess, a Class B mall is now an Amazon distribution center of amazing scale. And again, that's Cleveland. So you can see that kind of radiating taking place in other asset classes. I believe you're going to see it as well in regional gaming. There are, of course, certain friction points in some jurisdictions. The gaming real estate owner does require licensing. But we think at the end of the day, that will be a friction point that becomes less of a factor in how people make their decisions when they realize that some of these regional assets are so strong and have such a comparable scale and quality. And just to belabor the point in a moment, RJ, it was on this very call, the Q3 earnings call, I believe it was 2 years ago in 2019, that I made at the time that rather outlandish claim -- this was right after the Bellagio announcement, I made the rather outlandish claim that I would argue that National Harbor, which MGM obviously occupies and MGP owned at that point, deserve to trade at a cap rate at least as tight as Bellagio, given it's under scarcity as an asset of that magnitude of quality in a 24-hour city like Washington, D.C. So I do think it will come, RJ. It will, as is required in every other asset class it will take time, but it will happen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.\nBarry Jonas: I -- look, you've had a lot of success diversifying the company over the years, but I'm wondering if there's any longer-term optimal mix you would target, whether that's tenant, geography or maybe gaming versus non-gaming?\nEdward Pitoniak: John, do you want to start?\nJohn Payne: Well, good morning, Barry. As we\u2019ve been talking in the past 4 years, the key to it all is continuing to diversify our tenant base. And like you said, we've gone from 1 tenant to 8 tenants in gaming. As David mentioned in his remarks, we obviously have started diversifying into nongaming. I don't think we have an exact percentage of how much we're going to own in gaming and how much we're going to own in non-gaming, how many tenants we're ultimately going to have. But I think you've seen us continue to add high quality of, Ed said in his remarks, tenants to our portfolio, as well in gaming as well as in non-gaming. And so I don't have a percentage today. I think we've clearly said 45% of our rent after the MGP deal will come from Las Vegas and 55% of our rent will come from regional assets. So we still have a wide opportunity to diversify over the years, and we'll continue to look for unique opportunities with most importantly, high-quality tenants with great real estate. So no specific numbers today, Barry.\nBarry Jonas : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I think there's a lot of debate out there longer term, how iGaming will -- if it will cannibalize land-based gaming to any degree. I'm curious how you think about this and if it influences your longer-term strategy at all?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start, Barry. And obviously, we need to take care to distinguish as I know you are between iGaming and sports betting. And I think it remains to be seen the degree to which iGaming becomes its own ecosystem that does not create a new customer who also then acquires through iGaming, a desire to visit the brick-and-mortar casino. You've heard us talk before about how bullish we are about sports betting as being a very powerful secular audience expansion tailwind for gaming. iGaming remains more of a question. And I do think there are some very interesting points to be made as to the implications of iGaming in a manifest number of different perspectives. And I believe there was a panel -- oh, no, you wrote about it. The panel you wrote about Barry yesterday, I think, some people like David Cordish were making some very interesting points about the jurisdictions taking care that iGaming not end up sacrificing the jobs and the economic vitality that go with brick-and-mortar gaming. So again, we'll see over time. I would say, though, that I am much less worried about iGaming than I am excited about sports betting and the way sports betting is changing the marketing paradigm of American Gaming in such a way that American Gaming can participate in the Great American sports conversation. And if you had told me when I first started getting involved with VICI 4 years ago, which was my introduction to American Gaming, with Kenny Mayne and Trey Wingo of ESPN would join folks like John Payne and David and Samantha and me in the business of American Gaming, I would not have foreseen that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin from Capital One.\nNeil Malkin: Ed, first off, I'm not sure you meant by that comment about the logistics facility in Cleveland. Cleveland is probably the best city in the United States. So we're talking about...\nEdward Pitoniak: It is.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. So first one from me. You talked about 45% of your rent comes from Vegas. And obviously, it's going gangbusters. It's fantastic. But given the Venetian and your pending merger of MGP, alongside the 2 ROFRs you have there and your land parcels, are you comfortable with your exposure there? Might we see a move -- a potential property sale just to kind of mitigate the exposure going a lot higher?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start, Neil, and then I'll turn it over to John. But I think as a starting point, Neil, what certainly I have come to learn, I think, along with David and Samantha, those of us who the you are new to gaming, is that Las Vegas is almost unlike any other place on earth, the nearest place I can think of it is like Las Vegas is Orlando, right? And so -- and as VICI thinks about geez, how much exposure is the right exposure in -- sorry, in Las Vegas, it's like Disney thing about what's the right exposure in Orlando. Well, Orlando is an ecosystem unto itself. And it has an infrastructure that has taken decades to build and is unrivaled in the world in the way Las Vegas is infrastructure, tourism infrastructure is unrivaled. It's tourism, it's convention, it's conference, it's tradeshow infrastructure. So when you have an ecosystem as utterly distinct and one of a kind as Las Vegas. I do think you have to think about asset concentration or portfolio concentration in a very different way than you would in so many other asset classes in which not to be flip about it, but one 24-hour city is sort of like another 24-hour city. John, if you wanted to add to that?\nJohn Payne: No, Ed, I think you touched on it. Neil, I mean we -- if you've been following us since we started the company, there are other REITs that weren't as bullish as we are on Las Vegas, but we are very excited from the day we started the company. We're even more excited today about what's taking place in Las Vegas. The operators are here in Las Vegas are the most dynamic creative operators. There are -- they'll continue to reinvent the business when something doesn't work. And what's also been made perfectly clear after the closing of the facilities due to the pandemic as they reopen, the consumer clearly has not found a substitute for Las Vegas. They're returning in record numbers, and that's without the amount of airlift, that's without international travel, and that's without necessarily MICE business that's going to come back as well. So we're excited today about it, and we're going to be even more excited over coming years as those segments of our customers return to Las Vegas, to our tenants.\nEdward Pitoniak: And we [love even 2], Neil.\nNeil Malkin: Yes. I appreciate that. The other one for me, maybe bigger picture, obviously, the move to iGaming or digitization, whatever you want to call that, is going to be a fulsome and wholesome endeavor by a lot of the big gaming guys, operators. I'm just wondering if you can comment on how you think about how the investments and dollars needed to make those moves and to add that to part of their ecosystem or platform, how will that have an impact on potential assets coming to market as they look to raise -- raise money either on the Strip or regionally and potential impacts for you guys or new operators coming in?\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it's a good question, Neil. Exciting time in the space. I mean, I'll just talk about what's taking place today with our top tenant Caesars. And I don't think it's either/or. If you look at their investment in the bricks-and-mortar facilities right now, and there's more than I know. I know about the $300 million going into New Orleans, the $400 million that's going into Atlantic City, the numerous hotel, Nobu Hotels that are being built around their facilities, the reformation of the entrance to Caesars Palace, I could go on and on about the massive investment that our top 10 is putting in their bricks and mortar. At the same time, you can obviously just turn on your TV or your radio and see the large investments that they're making into Caesars sports book. So the beauty of this is their strategy as well as our other tenant strategy of connecting the dots or building a world-class omni-channel marketing capabilities where they can talk to consumers, not only digitally, but they can talk to consumers at their bricks-and-mortar facilities and continue to attract people across their platform. And that's what's so exciting about the gaming space. And again, if someone is who's old these days and has been around for over 25 years, there has not been a more dynamic and exciting time in the casino gambling space.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: You all mentioned opportunity...\nEdward Pitoniak: Stephen, you cut out.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: So John, I appreciate you highlighting VICI's pillars of growth in your opening comments. But I think one of the key questions from investors is how to think about how deep those pools are given the diminishing benefit to earnings growth from each sizable deal that you guys are doing. Would you be able to provide some context on the potential size of each of those buckets?\nJohn Payne: I can do sub of it, and Danny can do some of it as well. So Greg, we've laid this out a couple of different ways. But the short answer is there are a lot of opportunities still out there. When you just think of -- I'll take gaming and then Danny or David can jump in on nongame. And I'll take 1 of the 6 pillars because we -- I don't want to take up the rest of the call going through all 6 pillars. But I'll take one of them, which is the expansion of gaming. And just domestically, I want to even touch on the international opportunities that we see in Canada and Australia, potentially in Singapore, potentially in Japan. So just domestic gaming.  If you think of our opportunities, Greg, we still have -- do not own real estate in any downtown facility in Las Vegas. We still don't own real estate in Las Vegas in the regional markets, which are both very healthy and growing markets. We don't have Reno, Colorado, Rhode Island, Pittsburgh, [like] Charles, parts of Massachusetts. So we have an analysis that shows the depth and the amount of rent and the amount of EBITDA that is still available with assets that are not necessarily in the REIT pool right now. So that's 1 of 6 pillars. We see tremendous opportunity to grow in gaming domestically as well as the other 5 pillars that I don't know if David or Danny want to touch on quickly as well.\nDanny Valoy : Yes. I'll just add. This is Danny. On the gaming side, Greg, we still continue to work on transactions in any given week or month where the total value exceeds well over $50 billion. So that's not necessarily a TAM, but hopefully, that just gives you some insight into the number and different sizes of opportunities that we continue to work on, discuss, evaluate and target. Another piece going forward is going to be the VICI Partner Property Growth Fund. If you think about the size of our assets, a little over 2 million square feet on average at each property. There are high ROI projects, where we're partnering with our existing tenants and funding those pretty efficiently in exchange for incremental rent. Hard to say exactly -- hard to quantify that because it ultimately depends on the individual operator strategies, but that's something that could reach into the hundreds of millions of total investments. And then international, it's really hard to size or quantify, it's dependent on the jurisdiction, the individual assets within those jurisdictions. But as we talked about, we've spent a lot of time understanding the tax implications, currency risk, regulatory hurdles. So that is an area where you'll see us expand over time.\nEdward Pitoniak: I would just add, Greg, this is Ed, that we have a certain amount of confidence that we can figure out how to do what others have successfully done before us. When you crystallize the issue as you just did very well, which is once you get to a certain size, the math obviously does become more challenging. But at the same time, strategic resources can become more ample. So we look at what companies like Realty Income and Prologis have done in facing the mathematical challenge of growing, when you get really big. And we get full marks to meet and the Realty Income team for what they have done as an example, in the U.K. and now in Spain when it comes to increasing their exposure to European grocery. European grocery is not a category that we'd be interested in. But there is European experiential we'd be very interested in. And in fact, categories in Europe, they don't even really exist in the U.S., experiences like center parks, as an example. So we would look at what Realty Income has done. We would look at what Prologis has done internationally and domestically and especially through their strategic capital activities. So we're confident that if we learn from the best, we stand a good chance of achieving at least some of what they have done, and we're very excited about that opportunity in the years to come.\nGreg McGinniss: All right. Shifting gears slightly here, just regarding the call right on the big shot facilities. Have you worked out how you'll be valuing the real estate in the event that you're able to turn that financing arrangement in the permanent property ownership? And also, if you could provide any context on what you view as the opportunity or growth potential within this kind of entertainment base driving range space and maybe big shots specifically, that'd be appreciated.\nEdward Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Greg, it's David. Good to talk you. The financing is -- will be done at a 10% interest rate. And then the call rate will be at competitive 8 cap if we elect to enter into a sale leaseback on any of those facilities. We're excited to partner with the ClubCorp team, the Big Shot's team. They've got a very good development pipeline. They're going to mimic going to secondary markets, some markets where we can't -- don't currently -- or can't own gaming real estate just because it's not legal in those jurisdictions and they're invigorated to grow that pipeline to grow that platform, and we're thrilled to partner with them. So we'll see what the future holds with that opportunity between VICI and Big Shots.\nEdward Pitoniak: Operator, do we have Stephen available again?\nOperator: Yes, we have Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: Great. Can you hear me?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes.\nStephen Grambling: So you mentioned opportunities to fund high-return growth projects for existing tenant partners. How much the economics of these types of investments compare and contrast versus the traditional sale leasebacks?\nEdward Pitoniak: They should mirror them very closely, Stephen. Obviously, they need to be a sufficient return such that you could take the incremental return on the incremental capital and divide it in half at least, and each party is getting what they need and deserve. In other words, we would get a sufficient return through incremental rent on our investment, and the operator would get a sufficient return on the brand and intellectual capital and operating investments that they have made. So it should very much mirror our conventional economics. And again, if we can get growth capital out the door in whatever form we get it out the door as long as it's in the proper risk framework, we're going to be very happy to do so. And I will just reiterate what Danny said, our assets are of a scale and of a quality fit and finish level that you really only find an office and a mall. And as an example of that, our average asset is over 2 million square feet. It sits on dozens of acres. That's in contrast to your conventional triple net commodity box, which is 17,000 square feet and sits on an acre or [2], right? Our assets present incremental investment opportunities that really are hard to find in almost any other asset class.\nStephen Grambling: That makes sense. And maybe 1 more for you. Just on reconsolidation, obviously, with MGP, you made a first-mover advantage there as well. How do you think about scale and index inclusion like influence the potential for future REIT consolidation perhaps beyond just gaming.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. I think, obviously, 1 key determinant would be the degree to which we would not only be getting access to property with getting access to talent to a management platform that could be of great value to us in helping us grow not only beyond the acquisition of the portfolio of properties that might come with the M&A, but with the talent and the operating experience and reach that would come with it. We don't see that as an immediate priority. We think we have enough in front of us in terms of our existing categories that frankly represent triple-net white space that we believe we're uniquely qualified to pioneer in. But we are certainly mindful of the way in which adjacent M&A can be an effective way to continue to grow value.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: Just first question, in terms of expanding on the non-gaming side, you completed loan programs or established loan programs with Great Wolf, Chelsea Piers, ClubCorp now. Is that the path toward ownership that we should continue to expect as you look toward adding exposure to non-gaming? Or could we see you move into non-gaming in a more meaningful way without sort of establishing an initial loan program? And then also, how important is it to have an investment-grade rating to invest more meaningfully in nongaming and expand the portfolio towards some of those other types of assets?\nEdward Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Todd, good to talk. I hope you will. Look, I wouldn't say that the path that you should expect. The situations with Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf and Big Shots, called for financing, each of them were somewhat unique and specific and why they call for financing. But as you saw with Big Shots, we do have a call right to enter into a sale leaseback, so we do have a path to ownership, and you hit the nail on the head. These all lead -- ideally lead to a path to ownership. There may or may not be a sale of Chelsea Piers that may or may not be a sale of Great Wolf where we have the opportunity to buy the real estate. But if there is a transaction, we'll have a seat at the table and be able to compete for that opportunity. Ideally, our -- if we had -- if we could dial it up on a whiteboard, we'd have -- we'd entered into a sale leaseback day 1. But just again, the niceness of these circumstances is why there's they are mortgages today. And then in terms of the path to investment grade, ultimately at the end of the day, our cost of capital is what matters and allows us to compete. And so as our cost of capital goes lower, we feel that the funnel widens and we will be able to compete for more things, both within gaming and outside of gaming. So we're thrilled to be on the doorstep of achieving an investment-grade rating here in the near term.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then just circling back to the discussion around asset pricing. Ed, one of the pillars you discussed was the importance of being early investing at pre-institutional pricing. And we've seen pricing improve on recent deals and cap rates have come in quite a bit. John, you touched on City Center and the Cosmopolitan pricing. But is there still room for cap rate compression in gaming and in Las Vegas on the Strip in particular and which might have implications on sort of regional asset pricing as well? Or do you think that assets are more fairly valued on a risk-adjusted basis today? How do you just think about valuation in the current environment, I guess, more broadly?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, Todd. So I think the quick answer is yes. I think there's more room to run. I think one of the key things to keep in mind -- and this came up in a conversation that I was having with our partner at Blackstone, Tyler Henritze a few weeks ago, which he said, I think we should stop talking about cap rates, when it comes to gaming real estate. If we could just talk about unlevered cash flow going in unlevered cash flow yield because that's what we're getting, right? When we -- VICI buy at a 6.25% cap rate on the Venetian, we're getting 6.25% unlevered free cash flow yield out of the gate, right? And a number of you have written about the transparency and the predictability, the integrity of triple net cash flows versus so many other REIT categories where the supposed cap rate really is only a notional number that hardly ever resembles actual reality once you account for all CapEx and other forms of leakage from net free cash flow. So I think as investors look at gaming, they will look at the fact that you're getting true free cash flow in what you buy. And I think that could have a compressive effect. When you look at what other Class A categories, life office like every other category that is so big disguise right now, industrial and others, you're often looking at cap rates that don't actually reflect true free cash flow. In gaming, that's what you get and I think it will have a continuing effect on the compressing of our cap rates. And as long as our cost of capital continues to improve and a velocity equal to the velocity of cap recompression, we can very much stay in the game and David and his team and what they're doing with their balance sheet are making sure we do keep pace.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Kornreich from SMBC.\nJay Kornreich: As 2 of your nongaming investments have been with portfolio companies of PE funds that you also have relationships with on the casino side upon pending those closing just curious how important you feel those PE relationships are for nongaming investments and the opportunities that they provide?\nEdward Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Jay, good to talk to you. I mean part of it just stems from the magnitude of capital these institutions have, right? The amount of companies that private equity is investing in. And if we can play a role alongside some of the best real estate leisure hospitality investors in the world, we are thrilled to do that. So we look at a lot of opportunities. We have a lot of opportunities, and we continue to work with and understand other sectors out there, but these just happen to be with 2 folks that are also invested in real estate because they have institutions that are invested across all asset classes. And again, if we can find ways to partner with our existing partners and future partners in private equity, we will absolutely do so.\nJay Kornreich: Sure. And then there's a lot of -- there's several credit and liquidity enhancing opportunities in front of you, like we have discussed. Is if you can provide any sort of time line when you expect them to occur, such as the credit rating improvement potentially getting listed on the S&P 500, refinancing debt, such that you're incurring from MGP, any sort of time line when all those things kind of fall?\nDavid Kieske: Well, it all stems around the timing of the MGP closing, as Samantha alluded to, that's still on track for the first half of next year. And we would expect to issue the $4.4 billion of debt that we need to fund, again, the MGM Op unit redemption into the investment-grade market. We've worked very closely, led by Erin Ferreri on our team with the rating agencies to highlight the timing, highlight the transactions, highlight our funding and make sure that they are a lockstep with us. And so as S&P alluded to, if we keep leverage below 6x, we'll get a BBB minus rating. Well, with the equity raise that we did in September, and we are a pro forma balance sheet being projected to target, we're below that number. So we feel very confident that we'll achieve that investment-grade rating sometime in the first half of 2022, again, connection with the MGP transaction. And then the other part of your question was the refinancing of the MGP debt. That will occur at or near the time of those maturities. The MGP bonds are all bullet bonds, but we feel very good about the incremental accretion that we'll pick up from the interest expense savings as we start to refinance that debt, which I think the first one comes due in 2024, if I'm not mistaken, in 2025. So over the years, we'll have incremental AFFO pickup from that -- from those refinancing opportunities of the MGP bonds as well as the VICI bonds that are in place today.\nJay Kornreich: And if I could just sneak one more in. Just when we think about potential external growth internationally, do you see an opportunity to partner with your new MGM relationship to consider opportunities in Macau or the potential MGM Japan Casino development?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, Jay, I would say that Macau not likely, but Japan would be very intriguing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Question for John, putting your operator hat on, John, you mentioned earlier how well the Venetian did in the third quarter, $132 million of EBITDA. Any updated thinking about long-term performance of that tenant?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. So Thomas, I apologize. John had to race to the airport to get to Cincinnati for the grand opening of our Hard Rock Cincinnati asset in partnership with Hard Rock. So between me and Danny, we'll do our best. But we're obviously very excited to see those quarter 3 results without international travel, without the convention conference and trade show having fully come back. And I'll now turn it over to Danny, who I think can give you a quick summary of our confidence that this is the kind of performance that Apollo can inherit and continue to grow upon. Danny?\nDanny Valoy : Yes. Tom, as we've talked about, there's a lot of opportunity there in the existing asset. One of the things we found interesting was just the margin differential between the Venetian and then other assets on the Las Vegas Strip. We can't speak for Apollo and their strategy, but we would expect the existing team to run forward and execute on a lot of the projects and initiatives that they've created and have been evaluating for a long period of time. So look, I still think it's really early in the Venetian in their trajectory. I think there is a lot of opportunity there. Some of it's low-hanging fruit, some will take a little bit longer to execute on, but we're really excited, and we're looking forward to closing on that asset.\nThomas Allen: Perfect. And then just on -- well, first of all, respecting that you've done a ton of deals, I'm still going to ask a question about future deals, even though it's a little unfair given how much you've done. But most of your more experiential focused deals have been on the smaller side, are you prepared to do like a much larger deal? Or is the interest to kind of continue to kind of eat into that sub space?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. I would say, Thomas, there's nothing that would prevent us strategically or financially from doing bigger deals outside of gaming. You are right, so far what we've done has been on a generally smaller scale. Although I will say that assets like Chelsea Piers do qualify as we like to say, as casinos without gaming. The P&L at Chelsea Piers is actually very significant. So that's not entirely borne out. Obviously, when we only do a mortgage loan. But these assets do have some heft to them. Great Wolf Resorts, also have heft to them. So while our participation so far is only on the financing side, when the day comes when we're successful as we believe we will be, in becoming real estate owners of assets like this, we will be buying assets that have a lot of economic throwaway.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Daniel Adam from Loop Capital Markets.\nDaniel Adam: Just one for me on the anticipated funding requirements for the $4.4 billion cash consideration to MGM. In the 10-Q that was filed last night, I noticed that you expect to fund that portion of the deal with long-term debt, not equity, am I correct in thinking that you initially intended to use a combination of debt and equity when the transaction was first announced? And if so, does that change your accretion expectations at all for MGP?\nDavid Kieske: Dan, it's David. Good to talk here. Our intention from day 1 was always to fund -- our attention and our requirement, frankly, was to fund that $4.4 billion in debt. There's tax reasons why that has to be funded in debt and why that has to be funded really at the time of all conditions to the merger being satisfied. So the punchline is no. The accretion doesn't change. We'd always anticipated issuing equity, paying down the term loan and then essentially relevering at a point in the future once we go to the market to raise that $4.4 billion of debt.\nDaniel Adam: Okay. Great. And the timing around the funding of that? I imagine that will be close to when you expect the deal to close?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. We're often asked if we would put that into escrow, we take advantage of the markets ahead of closing. And again, the way that the agreements are laid out, the way that the tax requirements, what we need to satisfy for tax reasons. Again, we will not issue that debt until all conditions to the merger are satisfied, and we have a 30-day window under the agreement to issue that debt sometime in the first half of next year, we'd expect.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference back to Ed Pitoniak.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you, operator. So let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. We believe our shareholders are going to be very well served by VICI growing quickly and energetically in a newly institutionalizing asset class with great partners during what has been an uncertain period. We believe as well that we are well positioned to continue growing our portfolio accretively while driving superior shareholder value. Again, thank you, and good health to all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2021 was the most active and transformational quarter in our 4-year history at VICI. The highlight of our quarter of our year-to-date, of our history to date was our announcement on August 4 of our acquisition of MGP's market-leading assets and our new long-term partnership with MGM Resorts, who're one of the foremost leisure, hospitality entertainment companies in the world. Together with our March 3rd announcement of our Venetian acquisition, 2021 has been a step change year for VICI. So far in 2021, we've signed over $21 billion of transaction activity, giving us nearly $30 billion of acquisition activity in our first 4 years. And to fund that growth we have over the last 4 years, raised more primary common equity proceeds than any other REIT in America. We have a strong conviction that our energetic and execution-driven strategy over our first 4 years will, over the long term, create significant value for our equity and credit owners. We believe that there are 3 key factors that drive and validate our strategy. Factor 1, invest before others do. As an asset class institutionalizes, investing earlier rather than later, generally will yield opportunities to buy institutional quality assets at pre-institutional pricing. While other investors have begun initiating their mapping of the gaming real estate investment landscape, VICI and I should note, Blackstone have been busy buying great assets at unlevered going-in cash flow yields that are superior in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms than can be found in already institutionalized asset classes. This isn't to say that there aren't compelling investment opportunities still to be had in American gaming real estate. There definitely are as the sector's real estate is still not yet even 40% owned by REITs. But while others are getting starting on their homework, VICI has built market-leading proprietary ownership positions along with one of the most economically productive streets in America, the Las Vegas Strip. And VICI will also have built the largest and by far the highest quality regional portfolio in American gaming real estate once we close our MGP acquisition.  Factor 2, invest when others are fearful or uncertain. We began our 2021 acquisition work in late 2020 when most real estate investors were still understandably unsure about leaving the harbor and going out on to the blue water to fish. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was stormy in late 2020 and stayed stormy well into 2021. But at VICI we're willing to venture out onto the blue water because of our conviction that COVID have proven the durability of our asset class and the market-leading resilience of our operating partners. We've announced over $21 billion of acquisition activity in 2021 because of that conviction and in doing so, preempted any risk of being incomparable Venetian and the best-in-class MGP portfolio being bid to the skies when everybody was finally ready to come out onto the blue water with us. Factor 3, invest alongside great partners when given the chance. Many investors understandably questioned VICI's strategy when in late 2019 we announced our intention to support Eldorado's acquisition of Caesars with what ultimately became $3.6 billion of VICI Capital. We were constantly asked throughout 2019 and well into 2020. Can the Eldorado guys really achieve that $500 million of synergies, can they manage so much bigger an organization? Can they produce sufficient free cash flow and rent coverage? Will they have access to capital? Well, when we put our money behind Tom Reeg, Bret Yunker, Anthony Carano and the rest of the Caesars team, we are very confident that they would deliver, and you all know by now, without question, as they appear to have delivered far beyond everyone's expectations.  Similarly, when earlier this year, we began competing for the MGP portfolio, our determination to win was greatly energized by our conviction that Bill Hornbuckle, Jonathan Halkyard, Corey Sanders and the MGM team are growing MGM into one of the most dynamic and innovative brand and operating platforms in the global consumer discretionary sector. Our nearly $30 billion of announced investments over our first 4 years have enabled us to partner with great operators across the U.S., not only MGM and Caesars, but also with Apollo on the Venetian, with Hard Rock, Penn, JACK, Century, The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf and ClubCorp. All our current operators, every one of them is delivering top life performance in global leisure and hospitality right now. And the secular outlook for our gaming partners, if you're brighter, than one can find in almost any other category because of the audience expansion tailwind that sports betting represents. To repeat these 3 key factors that have driven our strategy in our actions, factor 1, grow fast in the early stages of institutionalization; factor 2, grow and others are uncertain, under willing or underfunded; factor 3, grow with great partners. VICI's activity in our first 4 years, driven by these 3 key growth factors distilled down to this. Before other institutional real estate investors are ready to do so, we've built a portfolio of Class A real estate of incomparable scale and quality and significant discounts to replacement cost and significant discounts to other institutional real estate categories of similar asset and income quality. And in doing so, we've created a network and partner relationships that will be a key source of growth for us for many years to come.  Now to talk about our growth outlook, I'll turn the call over to John Payne. John? Samantha, you want to take that? David, or Samantha, you want to take that? John? Yes, RJ. It is, I believe -- or I think it will prove to be a dynamic that we've seen in other asset classes that have gone through institutionalization as an example, a category that I spent time in final mile logistics. When there began to be an institutionalization of that industrial sub-asset class, the greatest amount of investment focused initially was in markets like the Inland Empire outside of L.A. and Northern New Jersey. And as the category really began to prove itself that as the secular trends behind the category continue to grow, what you began to see was a radiating out of investment activity from those epicenters. As an example, across the street from our JACK Thistledown asset outside of Cleveland, on a site that once how, I guess, a Class B mall is now an Amazon distribution center of amazing scale. And again, that's Cleveland. So you can see that kind of radiating taking place in other asset classes. I believe you're going to see it as well in regional gaming. There are, of course, certain friction points in some jurisdictions. The gaming real estate owner does require licensing. But we think at the end of the day, that will be a friction point that becomes less of a factor in how people make their decisions when they realize that some of these regional assets are so strong and have such a comparable scale and quality. And just to belabor the point in a moment, RJ, it was on this very call, the Q3 earnings call, I believe it was 2 years ago in 2019, that I made at the time that rather outlandish claim -- this was right after the Bellagio announcement, I made the rather outlandish claim that I would argue that National Harbor, which MGM obviously occupies and MGP owned at that point, deserve to trade at a cap rate at least as tight as Bellagio, given it's under scarcity as an asset of that magnitude of quality in a 24-hour city like Washington, D.C. So I do think it will come, RJ. It will, as is required in every other asset class it will take time, but it will happen. John, do you want to start? Yes, I'll start, Barry. And obviously, we need to take care to distinguish as I know you are between iGaming and sports betting. And I think it remains to be seen the degree to which iGaming becomes its own ecosystem that does not create a new customer who also then acquires through iGaming, a desire to visit the brick-and-mortar casino. You've heard us talk before about how bullish we are about sports betting as being a very powerful secular audience expansion tailwind for gaming. iGaming remains more of a question. And I do think there are some very interesting points to be made as to the implications of iGaming in a manifest number of different perspectives. And I believe there was a panel -- oh, no, you wrote about it. The panel you wrote about Barry yesterday, I think, some people like David Cordish were making some very interesting points about the jurisdictions taking care that iGaming not end up sacrificing the jobs and the economic vitality that go with brick-and-mortar gaming. So again, we'll see over time. I would say, though, that I am much less worried about iGaming than I am excited about sports betting and the way sports betting is changing the marketing paradigm of American Gaming in such a way that American Gaming can participate in the Great American sports conversation. And if you had told me when I first started getting involved with VICI 4 years ago, which was my introduction to American Gaming, with Kenny Mayne and Trey Wingo of ESPN would join folks like John Payne and David and Samantha and me in the business of American Gaming, I would not have foreseen that. It is. Yes. I'll start, Neil, and then I'll turn it over to John. But I think as a starting point, Neil, what certainly I have come to learn, I think, along with David and Samantha, those of us who the you are new to gaming, is that Las Vegas is almost unlike any other place on earth, the nearest place I can think of it is like Las Vegas is Orlando, right? And so -- and as VICI thinks about geez, how much exposure is the right exposure in -- sorry, in Las Vegas, it's like Disney thing about what's the right exposure in Orlando. Well, Orlando is an ecosystem unto itself. And it has an infrastructure that has taken decades to build and is unrivaled in the world in the way Las Vegas is infrastructure, tourism infrastructure is unrivaled. It's tourism, it's convention, it's conference, it's tradeshow infrastructure. So when you have an ecosystem as utterly distinct and one of a kind as Las Vegas. I do think you have to think about asset concentration or portfolio concentration in a very different way than you would in so many other asset classes in which not to be flip about it, but one 24-hour city is sort of like another 24-hour city. John, if you wanted to add to that? And we [love even 2], Neil. John? Stephen, you cut out. I would just add, Greg, this is Ed, that we have a certain amount of confidence that we can figure out how to do what others have successfully done before us. When you crystallize the issue as you just did very well, which is once you get to a certain size, the math obviously does become more challenging. But at the same time, strategic resources can become more ample. So we look at what companies like Realty Income and Prologis have done in facing the mathematical challenge of growing, when you get really big. And we get full marks to meet and the Realty Income team for what they have done as an example, in the U.K. and now in Spain when it comes to increasing their exposure to European grocery. European grocery is not a category that we'd be interested in. But there is European experiential we'd be very interested in. And in fact, categories in Europe, they don't even really exist in the U.S., experiences like center parks, as an example. So we would look at what Realty Income has done. We would look at what Prologis has done internationally and domestically and especially through their strategic capital activities. So we're confident that if we learn from the best, we stand a good chance of achieving at least some of what they have done, and we're very excited about that opportunity in the years to come. David? Operator, do we have Stephen available again? Yes. They should mirror them very closely, Stephen. Obviously, they need to be a sufficient return such that you could take the incremental return on the incremental capital and divide it in half at least, and each party is getting what they need and deserve. In other words, we would get a sufficient return through incremental rent on our investment, and the operator would get a sufficient return on the brand and intellectual capital and operating investments that they have made. So it should very much mirror our conventional economics. And again, if we can get growth capital out the door in whatever form we get it out the door as long as it's in the proper risk framework, we're going to be very happy to do so. And I will just reiterate what Danny said, our assets are of a scale and of a quality fit and finish level that you really only find an office and a mall. And as an example of that, our average asset is over 2 million square feet. It sits on dozens of acres. That's in contrast to your conventional triple net commodity box, which is 17,000 square feet and sits on an acre or [2], right? Our assets present incremental investment opportunities that really are hard to find in almost any other asset class. Yes. I think, obviously, 1 key determinant would be the degree to which we would not only be getting access to property with getting access to talent to a management platform that could be of great value to us in helping us grow not only beyond the acquisition of the portfolio of properties that might come with the M&A, but with the talent and the operating experience and reach that would come with it. We don't see that as an immediate priority. We think we have enough in front of us in terms of our existing categories that frankly represent triple-net white space that we believe we're uniquely qualified to pioneer in. But we are certainly mindful of the way in which adjacent M&A can be an effective way to continue to grow value. David? Yes, Todd. So I think the quick answer is yes. I think there's more room to run. I think one of the key things to keep in mind -- and this came up in a conversation that I was having with our partner at Blackstone, Tyler Henritze a few weeks ago, which he said, I think we should stop talking about cap rates, when it comes to gaming real estate. If we could just talk about unlevered cash flow going in unlevered cash flow yield because that's what we're getting, right? When we -- VICI buy at a 6.25% cap rate on the Venetian, we're getting 6.25% unlevered free cash flow yield out of the gate, right? And a number of you have written about the transparency and the predictability, the integrity of triple net cash flows versus so many other REIT categories where the supposed cap rate really is only a notional number that hardly ever resembles actual reality once you account for all CapEx and other forms of leakage from net free cash flow. So I think as investors look at gaming, they will look at the fact that you're getting true free cash flow in what you buy. And I think that could have a compressive effect. When you look at what other Class A categories, life office like every other category that is so big disguise right now, industrial and others, you're often looking at cap rates that don't actually reflect true free cash flow. In gaming, that's what you get and I think it will have a continuing effect on the compressing of our cap rates. And as long as our cost of capital continues to improve and a velocity equal to the velocity of cap recompression, we can very much stay in the game and David and his team and what they're doing with their balance sheet are making sure we do keep pace. David? Yes, Jay, I would say that Macau not likely, but Japan would be very intriguing. Yes. So Thomas, I apologize. John had to race to the airport to get to Cincinnati for the grand opening of our Hard Rock Cincinnati asset in partnership with Hard Rock. So between me and Danny, we'll do our best. But we're obviously very excited to see those quarter 3 results without international travel, without the convention conference and trade show having fully come back. And I'll now turn it over to Danny, who I think can give you a quick summary of our confidence that this is the kind of performance that Apollo can inherit and continue to grow upon. Danny? Yes. I would say, Thomas, there's nothing that would prevent us strategically or financially from doing bigger deals outside of gaming. You are right, so far what we've done has been on a generally smaller scale. Although I will say that assets like Chelsea Piers do qualify as we like to say, as casinos without gaming. The P&L at Chelsea Piers is actually very significant. So that's not entirely borne out. Obviously, when we only do a mortgage loan. But these assets do have some heft to them. Great Wolf Resorts, also have heft to them. So while our participation so far is only on the financing side, when the day comes when we're successful as we believe we will be, in becoming real estate owners of assets like this, we will be buying assets that have a lot of economic throwaway. Yes. Thank you, operator. So let me reiterate our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. We believe our shareholders are going to be very well served by VICI growing quickly and energetically in a newly institutionalizing asset class with great partners during what has been an uncertain period. We believe as well that we are well positioned to continue growing our portfolio accretively while driving superior shareholder value. Again, thank you, and good health to all."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. During the third quarter of 2021, we continue to execute the market-leading growth many of you have come to expect from VICI. The announcement of our $17.2 billion acquisition of MGM Growth Properties brings our total investment, as Ed said, to nearly $30 billion in 48 months. As I'm sure many of you can appreciate, this degree of activity does not come without hard work, dedication and relentless desire to succeed. As a management team, we are incredibly thankful for the hard work of our exceptional colleagues at what we call Team VICI, without whom many of our accomplishments to date would not be possible. As I've said before, VICI does not go on vacation or wait for the phone to ring after announcing or closing a transaction. Our primary day-to-day operations consist of sourcing, underwriting and funding accretive acquisitions. To that end, we are as busy as we've ever been building our pipeline and meeting with talented business owners and management teams to discuss how VICI can be an efficient source of capital and play a role in funding their growth plan. As we look forward, we will strive to execute across the many growth pillars we believe will make VICI as a stronger company while driving accretive AFFO per share growth for shareholders. Those growth pillars include executing transactions within our embedded growth pipeline, open market gaming transactions in the United States and internationally, our property growth fund through which we will fund high-return growth projects at our properties for existing tenant partners and leisure and experiential investments as well as continued large-scale M&A. There's never been a more exciting time to be investing across the gaming universe and Las Vegas in particular. Operationally, fundamentals are strong, and the casino operators continue to have a robust outlook for their properties. Margin expansion remains sticky, and the industry continues to post very impressive financial results. For example, some of you on this call may have noticed that just last week, Las Vegas Sands reported a record third quarter at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, with adjusted property EBITDA of $132 million, 97% hotel occupancy in the quarter and robust forward group bookings from 2022 through 2027. All of these results occurred in the third quarter that had very limited convention and meeting business and almost no international travel. Since we've announced the acquisition of Venetian Real Estate for a 6.25% cap rate, we have witnessed cap rate compression firsthand on the Las Vegas Strip. First, with the real estate of ARIA and VDARA, and City Center trading for a 5.5% cap rate; and most recently, just about a month ago with the Cosmopolitan's real estate trading just under a 5% cap rate or a 20.1x rent multiple. We have been among the biggest and the most vocal believers in Las Vegas since we started VICI and it's very gratifying to witness institutional capital enter the sector. VICI will continue to be at the forefront of gaming real estate, investing in assets in markets where we believe institutionalization is poised to occur.  In closing, we believe the outlook for growth is very promising and the transformation of our balance sheet, which David will touch on, positions us for continued success as we approach an investment-grade credit rating. And upon closing of our pending acquisition transactions, we'll emerge with a pro forma enterprise value that is approximately $45 billion, which is significantly larger than most of our direct REIT competitors.  Now, I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet and additional investments outside of gaming. David? So we continue to monitor. I think you're referring to -- first, we have some ROFRs in Las Vegas. Tom Reeg, the CEO of Caesars has indicated that they would be looking to potentially sell one of the assets and we'll be involved in that process and we'll follow his lead on what they're deciding to do. And then the second one, I think you're referring to is our put call that we have that becomes live in January '22 with the 2 large assets in Indianapolis, and we'll continue to monitor those as well. Those assets continue to grow, RJ, since we did this -- created this put call table games have been legalized at the racinos in the State of Indiana, and Caesars has been working on expanding those facilities. And those so -- those facilities are continuing to add amenities, add some space, add table games. And so we'll watch how they continue to grow. And we know that, that put call is good for 3 years starting in January. Well, good morning, Barry. As we've been talking in the past 4 years, the key to it all is continuing to diversify our tenant base. And like you said, we've gone from 1 tenant to 8 tenants in gaming. As David mentioned in his remarks, we obviously have started diversifying into nongaming. I don't think we have an exact percentage of how much we're going to own in gaming and how much we're going to own in non-gaming, how many tenants we're ultimately going to have. But I think you've seen us continue to add high quality of, Ed said in his remarks, tenants to our portfolio, as well in gaming as well as in non-gaming. And so I don't have a percentage today. I think we've clearly said 45% of our rent after the MGP deal will come from Las Vegas and 55% of our rent will come from regional assets. So we still have a wide opportunity to diversify over the years, and we'll continue to look for unique opportunities with most importantly, high-quality tenants with great real estate. So no specific numbers today, Barry. No, Ed, I think you touched on it. Neil, I mean we -- if you've been following us since we started the company, there are other REITs that weren't as bullish as we are on Las Vegas, but we are very excited from the day we started the company. We're even more excited today about what's taking place in Las Vegas. The operators are here in Las Vegas are the most dynamic creative operators. There are -- they'll continue to reinvent the business when something doesn't work. And what's also been made perfectly clear after the closing of the facilities due to the pandemic as they reopen, the consumer clearly has not found a substitute for Las Vegas. They're returning in record numbers, and that's without the amount of airlift, that's without international travel, and that's without necessarily MICE business that's going to come back as well. So we're excited today about it, and we're going to be even more excited over coming years as those segments of our customers return to Las Vegas, to our tenants. Yes, it's a good question, Neil. Exciting time in the space. I mean, I'll just talk about what's taking place today with our top tenant Caesars. And I don't think it's either/or. If you look at their investment in the bricks-and-mortar facilities right now, and there's more than I know. I know about the $300 million going into New Orleans, the $400 million that's going into Atlantic City, the numerous hotel, Nobu Hotels that are being built around their facilities, the reformation of the entrance to Caesars Palace, I could go on and on about the massive investment that our top 10 is putting in their bricks and mortar. At the same time, you can obviously just turn on your TV or your radio and see the large investments that they're making into Caesars sports book. So the beauty of this is their strategy as well as our other tenant strategy of connecting the dots or building a world-class omni-channel marketing capabilities where they can talk to consumers, not only digitally, but they can talk to consumers at their bricks-and-mortar facilities and continue to attract people across their platform. And that's what's so exciting about the gaming space. And again, if someone is who's old these days and has been around for over 25 years, there has not been a more dynamic and exciting time in the casino gambling space. I can do sub of it, and Danny can do some of it as well. So Greg, we've laid this out a couple of different ways. But the short answer is there are a lot of opportunities still out there. When you just think of -- I'll take gaming and then Danny or David can jump in on nongame. And I'll take 1 of the 6 pillars because we -- I don't want to take up the rest of the call going through all 6 pillars. But I'll take one of them, which is the expansion of gaming. And just domestically, I want to even touch on the international opportunities that we see in Canada and Australia, potentially in Singapore, potentially in Japan. So just domestic gaming.  If you think of our opportunities, Greg, we still have -- do not own real estate in any downtown facility in Las Vegas. We still don't own real estate in Las Vegas in the regional markets, which are both very healthy and growing markets. We don't have Reno, Colorado, Rhode Island, Pittsburgh, [like] Charles, parts of Massachusetts. So we have an analysis that shows the depth and the amount of rent and the amount of EBITDA that is still available with assets that are not necessarily in the REIT pool right now. So that's 1 of 6 pillars. We see tremendous opportunity to grow in gaming domestically as well as the other 5 pillars that I don't know if David or Danny want to touch on quickly as well."

            "name": "Danny Valoy",
            "content": "Yes, Wes, in terms of escalations, we expect that to escalate in with CPI, which was about 5%, so of the 2% floor that's embedded in that lease. So starting November 1 for the next lease year, the Las Vegas master lease will escalate about 5%. Yes. I'll just add. This is Danny. On the gaming side, Greg, we still continue to work on transactions in any given week or month where the total value exceeds well over $50 billion. So that's not necessarily a TAM, but hopefully, that just gives you some insight into the number and different sizes of opportunities that we continue to work on, discuss, evaluate and target. Another piece going forward is going to be the VICI Partner Property Growth Fund. If you think about the size of our assets, a little over 2 million square feet on average at each property. There are high ROI projects, where we're partnering with our existing tenants and funding those pretty efficiently in exchange for incremental rent. Hard to say exactly -- hard to quantify that because it ultimately depends on the individual operator strategies, but that's something that could reach into the hundreds of millions of total investments. And then international, it's really hard to size or quantify, it's dependent on the jurisdiction, the individual assets within those jurisdictions. But as we talked about, we've spent a lot of time understanding the tax implications, currency risk, regulatory hurdles. So that is an area where you'll see us expand over time. Yes. Tom, as we've talked about, there's a lot of opportunity there in the existing asset. One of the things we found interesting was just the margin differential between the Venetian and then other assets on the Las Vegas Strip. We can't speak for Apollo and their strategy, but we would expect the existing team to run forward and execute on a lot of the projects and initiatives that they've created and have been evaluating for a long period of time. So look, I still think it's really early in the Venetian in their trajectory. I think there is a lot of opportunity there. Some of it's low-hanging fruit, some will take a little bit longer to execute on, but we're really excited, and we're looking forward to closing on that asset."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet and highlight what was our most significant quarter in terms of advancing our long-term strategic financial goals. As you've heard me say, since emergence, we have maintained a relentless focus on ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. The initiatives we undertook in connection with the MGP acquisition further strengthened our capital structure and position VICI for continued year-in, year-out growth. And in connection with the announcement of the MGP transaction on August 4, we received extremely positive feedback from the rating agencies and just to read a snippet from the report that S&P released. The acquisition will improve VICI's scale and tenant diversity such that it could support a greater level of leverage at a higher rating if the company finances the acquisition with a mix of equity and debt that leads to pro forma leverage of about 6x or below and we could raise our rating to BBB minus. That's great news, and I will touch on leverage in a moment. On September 14, we completed the largest REIT common only equity offering ever, issuing 115 million shares of common stock at an offering price of $29.50 for aggregate proceeds of $3.4 billion. 65 million shares were sold via regular offering, raising $1.9 billion and 50 million shares are subject to forward sale agreements. This offering derisks the equity funding for the MGP transaction and positions the balance sheet to be below the leverage ratios dictated by the rating agencies to migrate the balance sheet to an investment-grade issuer. On September 15, we were thrilled to eliminate all outstanding secured debt in our current capital stack with a repayment of the secured $2.1 billion term loan. We used $526.9 million of proceeds from the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement on September 9 as well as a portion of the proceeds from the September equity offering to repay the term loan. In connection with this pay off, we also settled the outstanding interest rate swaps, incurring breakage costs of $64.2 million. This one-time amount is reflected in interest expense for the quarter, reducing net income and FFO but is added back to arrive at AFFO. On September 27, we announced a successful early participation in the exchange offer and consent solicitation for the $4.2 billion of outstanding MGP notes. As a result, upon closing of the MGP transaction, the covenants under the existing MGP indentures will be aligned with the covenants, restrictions and events of defaults under the VICI indentures.  Our outstanding total debt at quarter end was $4.8 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 6.3 years, and we have no debt maturing until 2024. And as of September 30, our net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA was 3.1x. We currently have approximately $4.9 billion in liquidity, comprised of $669.5 million in cash on hand and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. In addition, we have approximately $1.9 billion in net proceeds available from the March 2021 forward sale agreements and approximately $1.4 billion in net proceeds from the September 2021 forward sale agreements, which we intend to use to fund a portion of the Venetian acquisition. And since our formation just a little over 4 years ago, we have been relentless in our drive towards an investment-grade rating, and we believe the actions we took during the quarter should position VICI to be able to access the investment-grade market when we seek to raise the $4.4 billion of permanent debt required to redeem the MGM Op units at the time of the closing of the MGP transaction. Now turning to the quarter. We once again, continue to expand our partnerships outside of gaming by announcing a strategic arrangement with ClubCorp, an Apollo portfolio company related to Big Shot Golf. On September 15, we agreed to provide up to $80 million of mortgage financing to fund the development of 5 Big Shot Golf facilities across the U.S. As part of the arrangement, VICI will have a call right to acquire the real estate assets associated with any Big Shot Golf facility financed by VICI in a sale leaseback. In addition, we have a ROFO on future debt financing, Big Shot Golf -- and future financing Big Shot Golf seeks for any multistate development of their extensive pipeline of facilities.  Over the past 2 quarters, we have announced strategic with leading leisure and hospitality operators and we believe our relationships with Apollo and Blackstone demonstrate our ability to forge mutually beneficial partnerships that enhance our diversification and growth prospects. We're thrilled to partner with Big Shots and expand our relationship with Apollo and continue to look forward to a great partnership with Blackstone and the team at Great Wolf Resorts. In terms of financial results, net income and FFO was $161.9 million for the quarter or $0.28 per share compared to $398.3 million or $0.74 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to a $333.4 million one-time noncash gain upon lease modification that occurred in the third quarter of '20, a $79.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt and interest rate swap terminations in the current quarter and the $168 million noncash decrease in the Q3 '20 versus the Q3 '21 change in the CECL allowance. AFFO was $257.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 12.9% over Q3 of 2020. And just as a reminder, our diluted share count includes the impact of treasury accounting during the period of time the forward sale agreements are in place. During the third quarter, the impact of treasury accounting on our diluted share count was approximately 15.7 million shares. We refer you to our press release where we have added 2 tables detailing our outstanding common shares and a reconciliation of the weighted average shares of common stock used in the calculation of earnings per share. These tables are on Page 6 of our release that was posted to our website last night. In terms of our dividend, on August 4, we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, which is a 9.1% increase compared to the Q2 dividend. The Q3 dividend was paid on October 7 to stockholders of record as of September 24.  And finally, we are updating our AFFO guidance for the full year 2021 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As we have discussed, beginning in January of 2020, we are required to implement the CECL accounting standard, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and AFFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021, to be between $1.40 billion and $1.45 billion, representing an increase of $20 million in total AFFO from the prior guidance midpoint. Our revised 2021 full year AFFO per share guidance is $1.79 to $1.80 per diluted share, which is approximately $0.05 below the midpoint of prior guidance on a per share basis and is below the current consensus of $1.83 per share, which reflects certain analyst assumptions on the timing -- around the timing and closing and funding of the Venetian transaction, which are not included in our guidance estimates. The reduction in guidance reflects the dilutive effect of the addition of 26.9 million shares from the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement and the 65 million shares issued in the September 2021 equity offering and a dilutive impact as calculated under the treasury stock method of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forward sale agreements and the pending 50 million shares related to the September 2021 forward sale agreements. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Danny, go ahead. Yes, RJ, I can start and Samantha chime in on anything. I mean what we're experiencing and witnessing is just continued -- somewhat of a confirmation or conforming aspect of the leases, right? This sector is only 8 years old with the formation of GLPI in 2013. But as each deal, we and the operators continue to get smarter and understand the best way to document and structure a lease. And so when some of these opportunities arise to remove some of the legacy component, so to speak, of leases that really don't make sense for you as the operator or us as landlord, we work collaboratively together to streamline the leases and continue to move forward to somewhat of a \"industry standard\". So it's a net-net win for both sides here with between VICI and JACK. Yes, Greg, it's David. Good to talk you. The financing is -- will be done at a 10% interest rate. And then the call rate will be at competitive 8 cap if we elect to enter into a sale leaseback on any of those facilities. We're excited to partner with the ClubCorp team, the Big Shot's team. They've got a very good development pipeline. They're going to mimic going to secondary markets, some markets where we can't -- don't currently -- or can't own gaming real estate just because it's not legal in those jurisdictions and they're invigorated to grow that pipeline to grow that platform, and we're thrilled to partner with them. So we'll see what the future holds with that opportunity between VICI and Big Shots. Todd, good to talk. I hope you will. Look, I wouldn't say that the path that you should expect. The situations with Chelsea Piers, Great Wolf and Big Shots, called for financing, each of them were somewhat unique and specific and why they call for financing. But as you saw with Big Shots, we do have a call right to enter into a sale leaseback, so we do have a path to ownership, and you hit the nail on the head. These all lead -- ideally lead to a path to ownership. There may or may not be a sale of Chelsea Piers that may or may not be a sale of Great Wolf where we have the opportunity to buy the real estate. But if there is a transaction, we'll have a seat at the table and be able to compete for that opportunity. Ideally, our -- if we had -- if we could dial it up on a whiteboard, we'd have -- we'd entered into a sale leaseback day 1. But just again, the niceness of these circumstances is why there's they are mortgages today. And then in terms of the path to investment grade, ultimately at the end of the day, our cost of capital is what matters and allows us to compete. And so as our cost of capital goes lower, we feel that the funnel widens and we will be able to compete for more things, both within gaming and outside of gaming. So we're thrilled to be on the doorstep of achieving an investment-grade rating here in the near term. Yes, Jay, good to talk to you. I mean part of it just stems from the magnitude of capital these institutions have, right? The amount of companies that private equity is investing in. And if we can play a role alongside some of the best real estate leisure hospitality investors in the world, we are thrilled to do that. So we look at a lot of opportunities. We have a lot of opportunities, and we continue to work with and understand other sectors out there, but these just happen to be with 2 folks that are also invested in real estate because they have institutions that are invested across all asset classes. And again, if we can find ways to partner with our existing partners and future partners in private equity, we will absolutely do so. Well, it all stems around the timing of the MGP closing, as Samantha alluded to, that's still on track for the first half of next year. And we would expect to issue the $4.4 billion of debt that we need to fund, again, the MGM Op unit redemption into the investment-grade market. We've worked very closely, led by Erin Ferreri on our team with the rating agencies to highlight the timing, highlight the transactions, highlight our funding and make sure that they are a lockstep with us. And so as S&P alluded to, if we keep leverage below 6x, we'll get a BBB minus rating. Well, with the equity raise that we did in September, and we are a pro forma balance sheet being projected to target, we're below that number. So we feel very confident that we'll achieve that investment-grade rating sometime in the first half of 2022, again, connection with the MGP transaction. And then the other part of your question was the refinancing of the MGP debt. That will occur at or near the time of those maturities. The MGP bonds are all bullet bonds, but we feel very good about the incremental accretion that we'll pick up from the interest expense savings as we start to refinance that debt, which I think the first one comes due in 2024, if I'm not mistaken, in 2025. So over the years, we'll have incremental AFFO pickup from that -- from those refinancing opportunities of the MGP bonds as well as the VICI bonds that are in place today. Dan, it's David. Good to talk here. Our intention from day 1 was always to fund -- our attention and our requirement, frankly, was to fund that $4.4 billion in debt. There's tax reasons why that has to be funded in debt and why that has to be funded really at the time of all conditions to the merger being satisfied. So the punchline is no. The accretion doesn't change. We'd always anticipated issuing equity, paying down the term loan and then essentially relevering at a point in the future once we go to the market to raise that $4.4 billion of debt. Yes. We're often asked if we would put that into escrow, we take advantage of the markets ahead of closing. And again, the way that the agreements are laid out, the way that the tax requirements, what we need to satisfy for tax reasons. Again, we will not issue that debt until all conditions to the merger are satisfied, and we have a 30-day window under the agreement to issue that debt sometime in the first half of next year, we'd expect."

Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, July 29, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found on the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our second quarter 2021 earnings release and our supplemental information. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, Samantha. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on today's call. We're excited to talk about our quarter. John will provide an update on the environment for our operating partners, and David will summarize the outstanding growth that our second quarter results represent and briefly address our exciting new financing partnership with Great Wolf Resorts. But first, I want to address the topic. We've talked a lot about at VICI since VICI's emergence in the fall of 2017, and that's the topic of real estate asset class institutionalization. At VICI, we've been saying since day 1 in October of 2017, the gaming real estate deserves to be and we believe is proving to be the next great institutionalization story in American Commercial Real Estate. When we talk about real estate asset class institutionalization, we're talking about the process of institutional capital determining that an asset class is or isn't worthy of their investment. Worthy based on the quality and demand characteristics of the real estate worthy based on the quality of the occupants business and its credit. This determinization process requires learning and learning takes time and hard work. Most active asset management shops do not have a lot of excess analytical capacity or excess time to dig deep on new asset sectors. And there's no question that it's active managers who pioneer investment in the listed equities of new real estate asset classes where active managers go index managers follow. Active institutional real estate investment capital has had to do a lot of new learning over the last 10 years for real estate investment sectors as varied as cell towers, data centers, final mile logistics, single-family rental homes, manufactured housing, medical office and labs and of course, gaming. In some of these asset classes, institutional investors have the advantage of already knowing the underlying tenants either because the tenants already occupied other well-established real estate asset classes or because the tenants included America's biggest and best-known companies. In the case of gaming real estate, many investors, especially dedicated REIT investors were starting from square one in understanding gaming operators as tenants and ultimately, as real estate leasing credits. For that reason, our first few years at VICI were largely focused on helping investors, both dedicated REIT and generalist investors, understand our tenants' businesses, their marketplaces, their economics their balance sheet, their outlooks, their resilience and their overall creditworthiness. The very positive news that gaming operators as real estate tenants have proven themselves to be highly resilient place-based leisure operators through the COVID-19 pandemic and beneficiaries of the secular tailwind that sports betting represents. With our operators fully validated as an institutional quality tenant, as we believe they are, I want to turn the focus to the other key dimension of gaming real estate institutionalization dynamic. And that's the quality of our real estate assets as real estate, as physical construction. And let's start with scale. Our assets are big, really big. Pro forma for our Venetian transaction, VICI owns 63 million square feet of built real estate. And with 28 properties, our average property measures 2.3 million square feet. Compare that with the largest conventional triple net REIT where the average owned store measures 17,000 square feet. So again, that's 2.3 million square feet compared to 17,000 square feet. And why does scale matter? Because large scale tends to correlate to spatial complexity, multifunctionality, abundant reprogramming capacity and higher replacement cost. All of which adds to mission criticality. Gaming operators can't simply relocate to the nearest slab-on-grade tilt-up box. Our real estate isn't where in and out transactions happen. Our real estate is where experiences happen within built environments that aren't built simply the least, but built to last. These big buildings and the ample land parcels around them also create an opportunity for incremental capital investment for our tenants and potentially for us. And that kind of incremental same-store capital investment opportunity isn't likely to be available in the typical smaller box owned by a triple net REIT. The only other asset class is that combine this kind of scale with high-quality finish and indispensability are Class A office and Class A malls. But in the case of gaming real estate, investors can own large-scale and high-quality indispensable assets in a triple-net lease structure with the benefits of transparency and cash flow predictability that the triple net structure inherently offers. Our big assets also produced big rent. Our average annual rent per property pro forma for the Venetian closing will be $55 million. In comparison, rent per store as the largest conventional triple net REIT is $260,000 based on public filings. Again, $55 million versus $260,000. By a long margin, we believe gaming real estate assets produced the highest rent per property among triple net REITs. This concentration of value in large assets may mean concentration of risk, but we believe this risk is offset by the high quality of these assets. We would rather have value concentrated in high-quality non-commodity assets than dispersed across conventional commodity triple net boxes. Another essential institutional characteristics of game or estate is lease duration. VICI's weighted average lease duration right now is approximately 34 years, and the Venetian lease upon closing will effectively be 50 years in duration, including renewal options. And in the case of VICI, these long leases include rent escalation and pro forma for the Venetian closing 95% of our rent roll will have CPI kickers. These key characteristics of VICI's gaming real estate, scale, quality, indispensability, long life, lease length and inflation mitigation, make gaming real estate what we believe is a superior investment for all investors seeking total return. But these characteristics, we believe are especially valuable for investors who must manage long-dated liabilities. When you combine the long-lived nature of our assets with our long-dated leases, we offer a truly long-dated income-producing assets to offset those long-dated liabilities. All of these investment characteristics of gaming real estate give us great confidence when it comes to expressing our fundamental belief that gaming real estate is the highest quality, largest scale real estate that can currently be owned within a triple net structure, I'll repeat our belief gaming real estate is the highest quality, largest scale real estate that can currently be owned within a triple net structure. Consider the choice between Caesars Palace Las Vegas, a 9 million square foot asset on 82 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, the most dynamic experiential street in America or a discount store that sits on a fraction of an acre on a secondary road in a secondary market. You can decide what you prefer. And with that, I'll turn it over to John Payne. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As many of you may recall, in March of this year, we announced the pending acquisition of the real estate of the Venetian Resort and Sam's Expo Center in Las Vegas. Upon closing, this $4 billion acquisition will add $250 million of annualized rent, growing VICI revenue base by nearly 20%, and is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share. We agreed to acquire this iconic world-class asset in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip at a 6.25% cap rate. And just a few weeks ago, another real estate acquisition was announced in Las Vegas with Blackstone agreeing to acquire City Center's real estate from MGM at a 5.5% cap rate. The City Center transaction illustrates what we have been foreshadowing since our company was created. That is, when institutional capital realizes the discount between the incredible quality of gaming real estate and the undemanding valuation relative to other real estate asset classes. The days of the 10% cap rate transactions are over. Our acquisition of the Venetian real estate was announced at a very idiosyncratic time, during which the recovery trajectory in Las Vegas was unclear. We were highly optimistic as reflected in the 6.25% cap rate and prudently structured a transaction that worked for all parties while creating significant value for our shareholders. As those of you who follow the industry closely are undoubtedly aware, visitation, occupancy and consumer spend have continued accelerating in Las Vegas and operating margin expansion has become apparent. Midweek demand has been supported by the early return of meetings and conventions and the outlook for the back half of 2021 and 2022 is very promising. Similar to regional markets, Las Vegas is benefiting from very robust consumer demand and a new, more efficient operating model. As I've said before, the gaming consumer did not find a replacement for the bricks-and-mortar experience through COVID, not in the regional markets, and not in Las Vegas. As you can imagine, underwriting transactions during this time can be challenging. Each market and asset has unique attributes. The EBITDAR you consider underwriting 1 day could be significantly behind real-time performance just a few weeks later. No doubt this makes underwriting and negotiating a potential deal, a fun and creative challenge. We're fortunate our team has the ability and experience to manage this complexity. We thrive on this challenge, and we continue working relentlessly to execute compelling opportunities that deliver the utmost value for our shareholders. I now will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our recent investment outside of gaming and our financial results. David?\nDavid Kieske: Great. Thanks, John. I'll discuss our exciting new partnership with Great Wolf and touch briefly on our balance sheet and liquidity and give a summary of our financial results and guidance, all of which is fully detailed in the press release we posted last night. During the quarter, we continued to expand our investments outside of gaming by entering into a mezzanine loan agreement with Great Wolf Resorts, a Blackstone portfolio company. On June 16, we agreed to provide $79.5 million to partially fund the development of the Great Wolf Lodge Maryland, an expansive 48-acre indoor water park resort located in Perryville, Maryland. The loan bears an interest rate of 8% and has an initial term of 3 years with 2 12-month extension options. We will fund our commitment using cash on our balance sheet and expect to fund our entire $79.5 million commitment by mid-2022 in accordance with the construction draw schedule. In addition, we'll have the opportunity for a period up to 5 years to provide up to a total of $300 million of mezzanine financing for the development and construction of Great Wolf's extensive domestic and international indoor water park resort pipeline. We are thrilled to partner with Great Wolf, the leading indoor waterpark resort platform and institutional operator. During the quarter, we entered into a new $1 billion ATM agreement with the added flexibility to sell shares through forward sale agreements under the ATM. We've not sold any shares under the ATM in 2021. Our outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.01%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 5.6 years, and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of June 30, our net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA was approximately 5.0x. We currently have approximately $3.8 billion in liquidity, comprised of $407.5 million in cash on hand, $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. And in addition, we have access to approximately $527.6 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares under the June 2020 forward and approximately $1.9 billion from the future settlement of the 69 million shares under the March 2021 forward, which we intend to use to fund a portion of the Venetian acquisition, which John mentioned. Turning to financial results. And just one minor point to note in the earnings release. In the total revenue summary under second quarter results, the 8-K refers to a noncash leasing and financing adjustment of a negative $29.3 million. This should instead be a positive $29.3 million. Reported total revenues in this summary are otherwise correct. AFFO for the quarter was $256.1 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 45.3% over Q2 2020. As a reminder, our diluted share count includes the impact of treasury accounting during the period of time, the forward sale agreements are in place. During the second quarter, the impact of treasury accounting on our diluted share count was approximately 17.4 million shares. Our G&A was $7.6 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2%, which represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for the full year 2021 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning in January 2020, we were required to implement the CECL accounting standard which, due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We continue to expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021, to be between $1.010 billion and $1.035 billion or between $1.82 and $1.87 per diluted share. These per share estimates reflect the dilutive impact of the 20 - reflect the dilutive impact of the pending 26.9 million shares related to the June 2020 forward sale agreement assuming settlement and the issuance of such shares on December 17, 2021, the amended maturity date of the June 2020 forward as well as the dilutive effect of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forward sale agreement. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: It was great to see a new industry enter the fold. But could you provide some context to the size of the addressable market for indoor water park resorts and resiliency of those cash flows?\nSamantha Gallagher: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Greg, great to talk to you. I'm going to take that in reverse order. I mean we've spent over 2 years studying the indoor waterpark resort sector. And I've just come to be enamored with it. We're thrilled to partner with Great Wolf, who is the leader in the sector and has a phenomenal institutional platform led by Murray and team in Chicago. The cash flows, they're essentially casinos without gaming. There are multiple revenue drivers in terms of the indoor water park component, the family entertainment center, the food and beverage. So we've talked about gaming, multiple levers within a box. And it's not just a box. It's a very complex box. These are very expensive assets to build that have a very, very durable customer base durable customer experience, which we come to love. So high-margin business and similar to gaming, they were shut down during COVID, but they've reopened. The customer has returned and customers returned in droves, and they've opened under a new operating model with higher profitability and higher margins. In terms of addressable market, Great Wolf is the leader. There's 19 Great Wolfs out there. This will be #20. We hope to continue to grow the platform with Great Wolf. And this is a sector that we will continue to kind of study look at and hopefully, over time, convert into real estate ownership if and when the opportunity arises.\nGreg McGinniss: Great. And was this a marketed opportunity? Or how are you able to source the deal?\nDavid Kieske: We've - the team with Ed, John, myself, we've got great relationships. Our Chief Accounting Officer came from Blackstone. So we have good relationships with a lot of operators in these - as John has talked about, we've been out meeting with operators since day 1, both in and outside of gaming. And we've developed a relationship with the Great Wolf team and the Blackstone team and we're able to together a very collaborative transaction that worked for both parties.\nGreg McGinniss: Great. And then I guess final question, most simply, what's your appetite for additional deals in 2021?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. I mean, look, we haven't changed our plans. I continue to do, as David just said, with a great full team and the Blackstone team and other operators in gaming and outside game and continue to build what those companies are trying to do to grow? Is there a spot for us to help them grow as a partner for the long term? So I don't know what exactly is ahead of us, but we're continuing to be out there and build those relationships.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Adams with Loop Capital Markets.\nDaniel Adam: Whether it's Blackstone's real estate investment on the strip or your deal with Apollo at the Venetian or even your recently announced financing deal with Blackstone portfolio company, Great Wolf. It seems increasingly that private equity is looking to partner with or compete directly with the gaming REITs. So I guess looking ahead, do you continue to see private equities involvement in gaming opco and/or real estate assets accelerating, flatlining or declining versus, say, what we've seen over the past 2 years?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, Daniel, good to talk to you. I'll start out. We - I think the actual starting point and answer your question, isn't narrowly the issue of how much private equity capital will come into gaming, whether the opco or the propco, I think it actually starts with how much capital there is globally hunting free yield in a world where whatever it is today, 60% of ore of sovereign yield is negative. Capital, whether it's private equity capital or direct pension fund investment capital needs to find yield. And in the case of the brilliant deal, Blackstone did on City Center, buying a phenomenal piece of real estate at 555 gap. We must recognize that's not private equity per se. That is actually within their nontraded REIT, we believe. But the larger point is that to echo what John said in his prepared remarks, gaming real estate represents, we believe, the steepest great real estate on the planet on a comparative basis. In a day and age when industrial and even office to this day are trading at cap rates with 3 and 4 handles. Gaming real estate, even at a 5 handle on a comparative basis is of great value, especially for those again who are managing long-dated liabilities. The leases are long. They have escalation. In our case, they have CPI kickers and the capital is concentrated in assets that are absolutely indispensable to the occupant and the occupants are great credits as real estate tenants. And again, you're seeing more and more of this, where you might have seen as an example, that the Cadillac Fairview, the direct investment arm of Ontario Teachers, one of the leading direct investment pension fund complexes in the world has - is going to allocate more and more capital to real estate because they have determined that real assets are where they're going to have to get yield to make up for the lack of it in sovereign yield instruments.\nDaniel Adam: That makes a ton of sense. And then I guess, just with respect to the Great Wolf financing deal, your second such financing transaction with a nongaming operator, I guess looking ahead, do you also see accretive asset acquisition opportunities outside of gaming. In other words, do you see VICI diversifying not just its nongaming investment portfolio but also specifically diversifying its nongaming tenant and asset base over the next, call it, 1 to 2 years?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Dan. Look, just in terms of the loan, I mean, we use the loan - the loan tool kit as a pathway to potential real estate ownership. So we do expect to expand - continue to expand outside of gaming. But as we've been very vocal about, it's not an either or. The majority of our investments will be gaming just as Ed talked about, the magnitude of the assets, the magnitude of the cash flows. But we will look to continue to partner with great operators and owned real estate with great operators to help them grow their portfolios, whether through direct ownership or the continued use of the mortgage financing tool that we've been successful with to date.\nJohn Payne: And Dan, if I can just add to that as well. Just as a few years ago, when we started BK, you heard me on these calls talk about continuing to work with gaming operators to educate them on how a REIT like ours could help them in their capital stack and how we could help them grow. We're doing a lot of that in the - in some of these nongaming sectors as well as they're getting introduced to our company and our form of financing. And we're spending a lot of time doing that. And hopefully, that will lead to some accretive and exciting opportunities for us in the 1 or 2 years as you mentioned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist Securities.\nBarry Jonas: With PE paying record cap rates for gaming assets and the potential for new entrants, I'm curious to get your perspective to what extent your gaming expertise is an advantage in discussions with operators?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Well, it's definitely - there's no doubt having some expertise in this space is quite important. These are, as David talked about, the nongaming assets being complex, our gaming - our tenants have very complex assets. And really, over the past 18 months, the business has changed dramatically. And so understanding how the business has changed and what is the long-term outlook of the business is critically important. And then understanding how these companies are going to grow by meeting with the C suites is important. And there's no doubt that you've heard us talk about the importance of relationships. These are long-term deals when we do these things. And so it is important to have those relationships and the understanding of the core business and how it's going to perform over the years to come. So I'd say that's a long saying Barry, that it is important. We think it's an important part of the VICI's - our plans.\nBarry Jonas: That's great, John. And then just a follow-up question. We've obviously seen very strong cap rate compression in Las Vegas. Curious to get your thoughts on what we could see in the regionals, maybe what level do you think is reasonable?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start, Barry. What we will likely see in real estate is the dynamic that you tend to see in other asset classes as an institutional line. As an example, when final mile logistics really started becoming a higher category you tended to see the greatest amount of bidding activity in what were then the epicenters of Final Mile, which was chiefly the Inland Empire of L.A. and Northern New Jersey. And as assets got bid up there and they got bought up in those 2 markets, you began to see capital then seeking return and ownership of assets in other markets. So capital started going to places like Atlanta and Dallas and Chicago and Cleveland. I mean there's an Amazon distribution center across from our Distell asset, outside of Cleveland and a whole lot of capital went into that. And what you will see likely in gaming, is this same, if you will, radiating effect from the current epicenter of gaming real estate investment, which is Las Vegas, right? As the asset class continues to prove itself out. And as opportunities perhaps don't become as numerous in Las Vegas, capital will seek opportunities in other markets. And in regional gaming, they will find assets that are outstanding in their income producing and income resilience characteristics. So it's a matter of time, but that, I believe, is all it is, a matter of time if this is going to be like other institutionalized asset classes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird.\nWesley Golladay: I just want to maybe follow up on that last question. Are you starting to see capital flow to be the regional assets, whether it's on the debt side or the equity side or is it still primarily concentrated in Vegas?\nEd Pitoniak: Well, I mean, we certainly know what we hear, David, right?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. We know - exactly, and it's good to talk to you. And we've mentioned this before that our phones didn't stop ringing during COVID and some of the calls that we got were new entrants looking at gaming. And I think those new entrants are continuing to look at gaming, both within Vegas and outside of Vegas because - and these are primarily private capital sources who have historically invested in leisure, hospitality, entertainment companies, and they're almost through cash burn cycles. They're talking about cash burn, but they're looking at gaming, realizing, wow, how do I get into that sector? How do I potentially partner with somebody in that sector? How do I develop a platform in that sector? So I think you'll see more in the regional markets as time goes on here, just again, given the resiliency and quality of these cash flows.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then looking on the debt side of the equation, what are your plans for the financing of the Venetian? And where can you borrow today?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, we've been very consistent. We - as I mentioned in my remarks, we have about $2.4 billion of equity sitting in the forward. So that's - and then we will go to the debt markets later in the fall, unsecured high-yield markets to get to remaining $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion of proceeds to fund our $4 billion commitment for the Venetian. And our 10-year paper or 10-year quotes we've gotten recently is sub-4 kind of 3.5% to 4% range. Obviously, that bounces around a little bit with the markets, but we still feel very confident of our underwriting and the accretion we'll achieve from that transaction.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then one on the investment. When you look at investing in incrementally into your assets, what type of annual spend can we see here over the next 2 or 3 years? And do you have any active plans right now?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Wesley - yes go ahead, John.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Just to say, Wes, I think you're asking about our current tenants and our current assets. Yes, it's the responsibility of our tenants to do that. We obviously have some visibility to projects that that they're going to - big projects that they're going to put forth. We also have in our leases, some obligations, the size of investment that they make into our assets. But it really is the obligation of the tenant or the operator to make those capital investments.\nEd Pitoniak: Right. But I think what was if you're asking about what is the opportunity for us to invest incremental capital under assets, we did just complete a project or I should say, Jack, our operating partners Cleveland just completed a project at Thistle with the help of our capital, a new smoking patio that's proving to be an outstanding success for which we will be getting incremental rent. We are working with our operating partners to help them understand the way in which we can provide capital for expansion improvements, reprogramming especially as they continue to see demand levels that are really just outstanding. I mean, very - a moment ago, mentioned how strong the operating results are and I just can't help looking for an excuse to mention the fact that when Sands announced, I guess it was last week, they reported 98% occupancy in the month of June. No international travel. Not much convention business yet, 98% occupancy. And as you all know, they've got over 7,000 rooms. And at 98%, that means almost 7,000 room nights, a nights sold. Each night in the month of June with again, no international travel and very little citywide convention business yet, and yet that business is coming towards the back end of the year. So our operators are certainly looking at scenarios where they're realizing there can be opportunities for expanding their capacity in one way or another or reprogramming in one way or another to take advantage of what is just outstanding levels of demand.\nWesley Golladay: Got it. And then 1 follow-up to that. You mentioned the smoking at the Jack the facility there. Can you talk about how influential the ability to smoke is that facility? We have looked at the gaming data in Pennsylvania it looks a little soft but it looks like it's partially explainable\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it's been interesting, Wes, as this has been rolled out nationwide, there's been markets that started nonsmoking, Ohio, in particular, is a market that started out and still is nonsmoking. But what you heard Ed mention is the operators have created these outdoor facilities that allow smoking. And I think it's just to meet the demand of particular customer segments that want to smoke while they gamble. There are other states and cities even that are passing nonsmoking just have to monitor if that ultimately affects the business long term. But what Ed was mentioning is Ohio is a state that actually is non-smoking, but we help Jack develop a smoking area that is outside.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here this morning. I was wondering if you can take us through sort of the discussions you've had on the Chelsea Piers and Great Wolf side. Both of those were loans to start. Obviously, I think Chelsea Piers is on leasehold, which may have driven part of that. But I guess, sort of this risk balancing in terms of going in on the loan side versus going in on the fee and then doing a traditional sale leaseback. How should we think about sort of your incremental expenditure in non-gaming assets? Should we expect it to continue along the mortgage line with drawdowns in the future versus doing something more material in terms of investment?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, Michael, it's a good question and to hear from you. A grounds saying that execution happens at the intersection of opportunity and strategy. And what you've seen from it so far, Michael, in terms of both Chelsea Piers and Great Wolf was seizing on an opportunity. In each case, we did not have at the time we did the deal, the opportunity to buy the real estate either by a leasehold interest, which would be possible. Eventually it's easy peers or buy into the asset, either in a stage of development or fully developed. So we're using the financing vehicle in the way David described is a way to have a seat at the table such that if there is an opportunity to become the real estate owner in the future, we have a ringside seat in order to do so. And again, we're going to continue to tell every field we can really come into contact with. And certainly, our first choice will always be to buy real estate, whether it be simple or buying long-term leasehold interest if it meets our investment criteria. But again, we're not going to be doctrinaire, we're going to be opportunistic if we think the right risk/reward profile is there. And in the case of these 2 opportunities, I mean we just could not be more excited. Chelsea Piers, as you well know, it's just up the street premium as a comparable asset. And I'm not sure it's fully appreciated. It's not only New York's foremost recreation asset, it's Manhattan's best film production studios. And you don't need me to tell you with the news this morning about Hudson Pacific and Blackstone partnering on the development of new studio space in L.A. That is one really hot category right now and likely to stay so for the long term. So again, this is a bit of a long-winded answer, but we're going to use every tool in the toolbox to get a ringside seat for opportunities to grow our portfolio accretively over the long term.\nMichael Bilerman: And how do you think about - obviously, on the loan business, right, you get repaid and you don't have long-term ownership of those cash flows and would have to reinvest. Can you talk a little bit about the relationship with Chelsea Piers? It sounds like they drew down the other $15 million. And also on the Great Wolf side, obviously, that company was for sale. You probably spent some time looking at it to figure out some partnership. But how close are you to actually owning fee and doing a traditional deal in both of those cases? When should we expect potentially something to convert now that you've sort of been involved with both of those parties?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I mean in the case of Chelsea Piers, we couldn't put a highly specific timetable on it. But what I will tell you is that as we work with Chelsea Piers, one of the key things to keep in mind is that we like to partner with companies that are intent on growing and growing requires capital. And that's where we believe we probably can get our best traction over time, Michael. If it was just 1 operator with 1 asset, and that's all they ever wanted, our chances of doing something are what they are. But with operators who want to grow and who will require capital to do so, that's where we think the opportunity is I couldn't put a precise timetable on Chelsea Piers, but we are very excited about their growth ambitions. And in the case of Blackstone and Great Wolf, they've spilled out their growth ambitions. They're very expensive. And as David spoke of in his comments, we have the opportunity to keep funding them for quite a period of time, and hopefully be there with a very compelling offer there's an opportunity to become the owner of the real estate.\nMichael Bilerman: Now can they - just in terms of that relationship, you don't have any sort of right to - like right of first offer on assets or right of first refusal if you decide to sell assets. And that loan, is that I mean I don't know how the drawdown works, but could they sort of prepay you completely and walk to another type of lender. I guess what type of clause do you have into that organization? And I recognize you have a strong relationship with [indiscernible], a partner on the gaming side. But just I'm just trying to understand how tied that revenue stream is that could lead to future deals?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I'll turn that part of the question over to David.\nDavid Kieske: Michael, good to talk to you. As it relates to Gray Wolf, we do have a similar ROFO in place with Great Wolf in the event they like to sell. So similar as they talked about with Chelsea Piers, they may or may not like to sell single assets. But it's - what this does is gives us a seat at the table. And we will get monthly reporting information. We'll have - we have a very good dialogue with Murray and team, who runs Great Wolf, and we have a very good dialogue with the Blackstone team that will ultimately look to monetize this. So being in the mix and being in that flow keeps us close to the opportunity to secure long-term real estate. And part of our ability, part of what we bring to the table is that next slug of capital. There is - it's Great Wolf put out in our press release, JPMorgan has the senior loan on this Perryville development. And as you know, or you can talk to colleagues in the rest of the Citi Group organization, construction financing is not a deep bucket of financing. So for us to be able to provide the mezzanine component for this asset and a handful of many more. That's a very attractive piece of capital, especially when Great Wolf is out talking to securing future sites and being able to demonstrate that they have the capital and ready to go for future development. So there is a 5-year term, obviously, on the mezzanine piece, but we don't have - we don't believe it will be repaid quickly, and it will take 2 years to develop and then a little bit of time to stabilize. So while it's not a 35-year lease. We do like the investment and we do like what it opens up for us.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. One thing I just want to add, Michael, is that one thing that our embedded growth pipeline does give us the ability to do is invest time and energy in the developing of relationships that may not pay off for years. But nonetheless, we want to do that. An example of that was when John Payne started calling on Rob Goldstein, the CEO of Las Vegas Sands a couple of years ago with some of us going, yes, okay, go ahead, John. We're not sure that ever going to pay off. And obviously, it has. And similarly, whether it be in gaming or nongaming, our business model allows us to invest time into relationships that if we grow those relationships successfully, they represent our future growth in the years to come. And if we're investing time in a relationship here in 2021 that pays off in 2025, we feel we're actually doing our jobs right. But again, our business model allows us to do that in a way that some of the REIT management teams may not enjoy.\nMichael Bilerman: And so how deep is that list? Is it 10 different types of experiential investments in terms of asset categories? Or is it more limited to like 2 or 3? I guess where are you placing how many different types of bets are you placing across industry verticals rather than within a vertical?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I think we're into double digits, John and David. I mean we're in the categories day by day that frankly, we weren't even on our radar 2 years ago. But as we evaluate them, we see the 4 things we most want, which is low cyclicality, no secular threat, healthy supply-demand balance and a durable end user experience. It's again, proven its durability for decades going backwards and promises to be durable for decades going forward. And there's a lot of white space out there, Michael, that the opco propco model has not pioneered that we think has the potential to be pioneered, especially within experiential sectors that have demographic tailwinds behind them for the next 10, 20 years that promise real growth opportunity to the operator, which will require capital, which we are so thrilled to provide.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: I know that you provided the rent contribution from some of the outstanding transactions that you've discussed. But could you actually maybe put a range around the AFFO per share post all these transactions that have kind of been announced and are pending at this point?\nEd Pitoniak: David.\nDavid Kieske: It's David. Look, as I talked about, we reiterated our guidance of $1.82 to $1.87. John touched on the fact we'll get $250 million of incremental rent. And we think with an additional $1.5 billion of debt in and around 4%, you could probably - you can get pretty close to the AFFO impact there.\nStephen Grambling: Got it. And then I guess one other follow-up is just unrelated to that. Just as you've been looking at the strength of Las Vegas and the regional markets here, and I know you kind of talked to this in some of the remarks and the questions, but are you, at this point, starting to see either in bid processes or even in your own underwriting a shift away from underwriting to 2019 and now being willing to kind of think about a normalized run rate that is above that or even at the levels that we've been seeing?\nJohn Payne: Stephen, it's John. It's a great question. I'll start by saying, boy, a lot of props to the operators in the gaming business right now. I mean our tenants - our public tenants have not announced their earnings, but you saw the earnings at Boyd and Red Rock and Monarch and Churchill and Sam's and others out there. And you do have to say, kudos to them for reinventing their business during this very tough time and showing incredible operating margins. I'll answer the question by saying, you really have to take an asset by asset, Stephen. You really have to go through and understand if there's an asset that's seeing considerable growth through the 2019 numbers, where are they getting and what segments they're getting and what margin are they getting it? How did they increase their margin? And this goes to my opening remarks by saying having expertise in our organization to be able to dig in, it allows you, if you are going to do a deal and do underwrite during this unique time to get a real good number that you're comfortable with on the EBITDAR level. And those are the type of things we'll do if there's an opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree with CBRE.\nUnidentified Analyst: Maybe 1 for John or David, on the put call with Hosur Park and Indiana Grand racing. I think the window opens in about 6 months. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy and kind of managing the pipeline and what might convince you to exercise that sooner than later or hold off?\nEd Pitoniak: Before John - before John and David answered that question, John DeCree, I just wanted to point out, but everyone's benefit, the name of the firm that you are now associated with. Union Gaming, having become part of CBRE, I think is evidence of the fact that real estate - gaming real estate is in the institutionalization process when a company of the stature in global commercial real estate of CBRE besides this is the game that need to start playing in. So anyway, congratulations, John, and over to you, John Payne and David Kieske.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks Ed, I appreciate that. We're excited.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Congrats, John. And John, to your question about the 2 Indiana tracks and casinos in Indianapolis. Our tenant has done a great job in taking those businesses over. You've probably been tracking the revenue levels there. They've also committed to large capital projects to both of those assets as table games has started at those 2 assets. There wasn't table games before that. Those construction projects continue. The business will take a little bit of time to stabilize after they get the capital projects in place. As you mentioned, the put call becomes active. It's 6 months from now. So we'll continue to watch these assets, see them grow. Obviously, we're partners with Caesars. The operator will continue to talk to Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker and understand what's going on there, and then we'll see how it ultimately plays out with the put call on the timing.\nUnidentified Analyst: And maybe 1 for Ed on his favorite topic today and 1 that's near and dear to us on the institution of casino real estate. One of the questions we've dealt with over the past several years, Ed, as you have as well is some of the holdouts on casino real estate, some of the operators who've been a little bit more reluctant. But since probably 1 of those camps as we would have looked at and as you suggested earlier, but as cap rates continue to compress, I think the opportunity just gets more and more compelling for operators to consider you as a financing source. So my question, Ed, is at this current trajectory, do you think that over time, the majority or vast majority of casino real estate will be owned away from operators like some of the other real estate asset classes over time.\nEd Pitoniak: It's a good - maybe hard to answer question, John. I do think so much of the answer comes down to what would the recipient of the proceeds do with the proceeds, right? And I think what you're seeing so far, John, is that the propco model, the participation of a REIT is really valuable when an operator wants to grow and/or when an owner of an asset wants to exit entirely. You've not seen a whole lot of sale leasebacks undertaken for the sheer sake of financial engineering at this point, right? Which is probably healthy and sound. I mean, this should be done when an operator has a compelling use for the proceeds, whether to reinvest in their business, to grow their business, or otherwise achieve liquidity or for partners who need that liquidity. There is no question, John, that the fullest value of an asset will be realized with an opco propco model. It's really going to be up to the owners of the assets as to how they want to crystallize their value and when they want to. And to be honest with you, selfishly, if this is a process that takes years to unfold that's better. Because if it unfolds over many years to come, which I think is actually probably the likely bet, it produces a more sustained growth pipeline and gaming real estate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Landenburg.\nJohn Massocca: So it was notable that the Great Wolf asset you're providing the construction lending floor was next to a casino property, albeit when you don't own. In your discussions with Great Wolf, was that proximity an important factor in why they chose that location? And I guess, with the read-through for VICI, could you utilize the excess land in your regional casino portfolio to maybe do more deals with Great Wolf? I mean, especially now that you have this kind of financing agreement or understanding is that something that was kind of part of the conversation as you were [indiscernible]?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: John, good to talk to you. The proximity of the Perryville Colocation was not part of the discussion. I think what it does is create a very - such to create an experiential entertainment center, which will be great both for the Great Wolf asset as well as PEM and GLPI who owned that real estate. But Great Wolf was able to secure the site. It's right off of 95. It's - as you've seen with the indoor water park resorts over time, closer to the core as this sector has become more institutionalized, you go back several years. They were further away from urban areas and cheaper land in areas that were a little bit cheaper to build. So this is just a continued institutionalization of the indoor water park sector. As it relates to our lands, if there's an opportunity with 1 of our tenants to put into a water park on [indiscernible] we would be happy to provide capital for.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. But it sounds like developable land right of 95 is kind of a premium. And so the reason why it was a good place to put a casino there is also why it's a good place to put in your water park.\nDavid Kieske: Exactly\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. And John, if I were going to on [indiscernible], which maybe a weakness for, I would say that the power center of the future won't be retail, it will be experiential. And as John Payne could attest to, it's actually American tribal gaming operators who are really the first in gaming to realize that they have the opportunity to create experiential power centers around so many of the amazing assets that they've developed and are operating.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. And then another kind of bigger picture question. You talked before about the potential for the frontage space in front us, can you just tell us right there on the strip, given the announcement from Caesars earlier this month that they're kind of going to renovate the main entrance to Caesars Palace, does that impact your outlook for that space at all the potential for development there? I mean could it accelerate it? Could it maybe reduce it given what [indiscernible] is trying to do with its main entrance? Just any kind of outlook there?\nJohn Payne: We're very excited about what Tom Reeg and Bret and Anthony Cronto announced about our marquee asset and addressing the entrants and making it more welcoming. I think that's going to be a fantastic project. I think you're talking about the acreage that we own that's part of the Las Vegas lease in front of Caesars Palace. And I think that, that is just a great piece of real estate that I know my partners at Caesars continue to look at what is the most appropriate development that goes there for the long term of Las Vegas and bring that casino out to the strip. And I know they're continuing to look at it. So I'm not sure there's a connection between the making the front entrance right now more accessible and the new development. But I do know that, over time, it's a great piece of real estate that could be developed into just some world-class opportunity to attract more customers to that building.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Kornreich with SMBC.\nJay Kornreich: As gaming cap rate compression specifically in Vegas, may make it harder to find accretive deals, is this environment motivating you to look further into nongaming investments?\nJohn Payne: I don't...\nEd Pitoniak: Go ahead, John.\nJohn Payne: Yes. I don't think it's - I was going to stress earlier when we were talking a lot about the nongaming opportunity as we're clearly spending time doing that. It's not an either or David talked about this earlier, and we've been talking about this for a couple of years is we've got capacity to do both. We see a nice runway in gaming. We're going to continue to build relationships in gaming, which should lead as it has for 3.5 years to accretive gaming deals. But we have the capacity now to look in other sectors and other opportunities that fit within our portfolio and that would work for our shareholders. So it's important to know it's not it's not an either where we have the ability to do both, and we're going to continue to do both.\nJay Kornreich: Got it. And then just regarding the remaining up to $300 million of capital for the Great Wolf Resorts, do you have any guidance on potential timing of how they would call that down?\nDavid Kieske: Jay, it's David. We don't have any guidance. I have to ask Great Wolf. But we do know that they've got a very robust pipeline. And as I mentioned, their customer continued to want to visit the water parks even and get back out and they've seen a very big resurgence in their bookings and their activity at their assets. So they're seeing a great opportunity to expand the platform here, and we excited to partner with them on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Ravi Baby on the line for Todd Thomas. You guys weathered the pandemic well with perfect collections. Can you comment on the impact of the Delta variant and the Nevada announcement earlier this seams being required in public places what impact could this have to casino traffic and activity?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it's a good question, and we'll continue to monitor. I think you know when the casinos opened in Las Vegas and had tremendous demand at the beginning when they open, they did require a mask for employees and for customers. And then it's been over the past couple of months where masks have been removed. And as you said, Clark County is saying that the mass need to come back for the operators, for the employees and the guests. So we'll continue to monitor it as the entire United States is. But as we saw when the casinos opened up, there still is a tremendous amount of demand for Las Vegas and for the assets that we own the real estate for our operators. So just more to come, but they have gone through this before the end of 2020 and the beginning of '21 and they're prepared, and I'm sure there'll be another opportunity where mask will be removed, but we'll monitor that accordingly.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude the Q&A portion. I will turn the call back over to Ed Pitoniak for closing remarks.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody. We're excited about the continuing institutionalization of gaming as a real estate asset class and believe we are well positioned to continue driving spirit shareholder - superior shareholder value. Again, thanks and good health to all. Bye for now.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thanks, Samantha. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on today's call. We're excited to talk about our quarter. John will provide an update on the environment for our operating partners, and David will summarize the outstanding growth that our second quarter results represent and briefly address our exciting new financing partnership with Great Wolf Resorts. But first, I want to address the topic. We've talked a lot about at VICI since VICI's emergence in the fall of 2017, and that's the topic of real estate asset class institutionalization. At VICI, we've been saying since day 1 in October of 2017, the gaming real estate deserves to be and we believe is proving to be the next great institutionalization story in American Commercial Real Estate. When we talk about real estate asset class institutionalization, we're talking about the process of institutional capital determining that an asset class is or isn't worthy of their investment. Worthy based on the quality and demand characteristics of the real estate worthy based on the quality of the occupants business and its credit. This determinization process requires learning and learning takes time and hard work. Most active asset management shops do not have a lot of excess analytical capacity or excess time to dig deep on new asset sectors. And there's no question that it's active managers who pioneer investment in the listed equities of new real estate asset classes where active managers go index managers follow. Active institutional real estate investment capital has had to do a lot of new learning over the last 10 years for real estate investment sectors as varied as cell towers, data centers, final mile logistics, single-family rental homes, manufactured housing, medical office and labs and of course, gaming. In some of these asset classes, institutional investors have the advantage of already knowing the underlying tenants either because the tenants already occupied other well-established real estate asset classes or because the tenants included America's biggest and best-known companies. In the case of gaming real estate, many investors, especially dedicated REIT investors were starting from square one in understanding gaming operators as tenants and ultimately, as real estate leasing credits. For that reason, our first few years at VICI were largely focused on helping investors, both dedicated REIT and generalist investors, understand our tenants' businesses, their marketplaces, their economics their balance sheet, their outlooks, their resilience and their overall creditworthiness. The very positive news that gaming operators as real estate tenants have proven themselves to be highly resilient place-based leisure operators through the COVID-19 pandemic and beneficiaries of the secular tailwind that sports betting represents. With our operators fully validated as an institutional quality tenant, as we believe they are, I want to turn the focus to the other key dimension of gaming real estate institutionalization dynamic. And that's the quality of our real estate assets as real estate, as physical construction. And let's start with scale. Our assets are big, really big. Pro forma for our Venetian transaction, VICI owns 63 million square feet of built real estate. And with 28 properties, our average property measures 2.3 million square feet. Compare that with the largest conventional triple net REIT where the average owned store measures 17,000 square feet. So again, that's 2.3 million square feet compared to 17,000 square feet. And why does scale matter? Because large scale tends to correlate to spatial complexity, multifunctionality, abundant reprogramming capacity and higher replacement cost. All of which adds to mission criticality. Gaming operators can't simply relocate to the nearest slab-on-grade tilt-up box. Our real estate isn't where in and out transactions happen. Our real estate is where experiences happen within built environments that aren't built simply the least, but built to last. These big buildings and the ample land parcels around them also create an opportunity for incremental capital investment for our tenants and potentially for us. And that kind of incremental same-store capital investment opportunity isn't likely to be available in the typical smaller box owned by a triple net REIT. The only other asset class is that combine this kind of scale with high-quality finish and indispensability are Class A office and Class A malls. But in the case of gaming real estate, investors can own large-scale and high-quality indispensable assets in a triple-net lease structure with the benefits of transparency and cash flow predictability that the triple net structure inherently offers. Our big assets also produced big rent. Our average annual rent per property pro forma for the Venetian closing will be $55 million. In comparison, rent per store as the largest conventional triple net REIT is $260,000 based on public filings. Again, $55 million versus $260,000. By a long margin, we believe gaming real estate assets produced the highest rent per property among triple net REITs. This concentration of value in large assets may mean concentration of risk, but we believe this risk is offset by the high quality of these assets. We would rather have value concentrated in high-quality non-commodity assets than dispersed across conventional commodity triple net boxes. Another essential institutional characteristics of game or estate is lease duration. VICI's weighted average lease duration right now is approximately 34 years, and the Venetian lease upon closing will effectively be 50 years in duration, including renewal options. And in the case of VICI, these long leases include rent escalation and pro forma for the Venetian closing 95% of our rent roll will have CPI kickers. These key characteristics of VICI's gaming real estate, scale, quality, indispensability, long life, lease length and inflation mitigation, make gaming real estate what we believe is a superior investment for all investors seeking total return. But these characteristics, we believe are especially valuable for investors who must manage long-dated liabilities. When you combine the long-lived nature of our assets with our long-dated leases, we offer a truly long-dated income-producing assets to offset those long-dated liabilities. All of these investment characteristics of gaming real estate give us great confidence when it comes to expressing our fundamental belief that gaming real estate is the highest quality, largest scale real estate that can currently be owned within a triple net structure, I'll repeat our belief gaming real estate is the highest quality, largest scale real estate that can currently be owned within a triple net structure. Consider the choice between Caesars Palace Las Vegas, a 9 million square foot asset on 82 acres on the Las Vegas Strip, the most dynamic experiential street in America or a discount store that sits on a fraction of an acre on a secondary road in a secondary market. You can decide what you prefer. And with that, I'll turn it over to John Payne. John? John? Yes, Daniel, good to talk to you. I'll start out. We - I think the actual starting point and answer your question, isn't narrowly the issue of how much private equity capital will come into gaming, whether the opco or the propco, I think it actually starts with how much capital there is globally hunting free yield in a world where whatever it is today, 60% of ore of sovereign yield is negative. Capital, whether it's private equity capital or direct pension fund investment capital needs to find yield. And in the case of the brilliant deal, Blackstone did on City Center, buying a phenomenal piece of real estate at 555 gap. We must recognize that's not private equity per se. That is actually within their nontraded REIT, we believe. But the larger point is that to echo what John said in his prepared remarks, gaming real estate represents, we believe, the steepest great real estate on the planet on a comparative basis. In a day and age when industrial and even office to this day are trading at cap rates with 3 and 4 handles. Gaming real estate, even at a 5 handle on a comparative basis is of great value, especially for those again who are managing long-dated liabilities. The leases are long. They have escalation. In our case, they have CPI kickers and the capital is concentrated in assets that are absolutely indispensable to the occupant and the occupants are great credits as real estate tenants. And again, you're seeing more and more of this, where you might have seen as an example, that the Cadillac Fairview, the direct investment arm of Ontario Teachers, one of the leading direct investment pension fund complexes in the world has - is going to allocate more and more capital to real estate because they have determined that real assets are where they're going to have to get yield to make up for the lack of it in sovereign yield instruments. David? John? Yes. I'll start, Barry. What we will likely see in real estate is the dynamic that you tend to see in other asset classes as an institutional line. As an example, when final mile logistics really started becoming a higher category you tended to see the greatest amount of bidding activity in what were then the epicenters of Final Mile, which was chiefly the Inland Empire of L.A. and Northern New Jersey. And as assets got bid up there and they got bought up in those 2 markets, you began to see capital then seeking return and ownership of assets in other markets. So capital started going to places like Atlanta and Dallas and Chicago and Cleveland. I mean there's an Amazon distribution center across from our Distell asset, outside of Cleveland and a whole lot of capital went into that. And what you will see likely in gaming, is this same, if you will, radiating effect from the current epicenter of gaming real estate investment, which is Las Vegas, right? As the asset class continues to prove itself out. And as opportunities perhaps don't become as numerous in Las Vegas, capital will seek opportunities in other markets. And in regional gaming, they will find assets that are outstanding in their income producing and income resilience characteristics. So it's a matter of time, but that, I believe, is all it is, a matter of time if this is going to be like other institutionalized asset classes. Well, I mean, we certainly know what we hear, David, right? Yes. Wesley - yes go ahead, John. Right. But I think what was if you're asking about what is the opportunity for us to invest incremental capital under assets, we did just complete a project or I should say, Jack, our operating partners Cleveland just completed a project at Thistle with the help of our capital, a new smoking patio that's proving to be an outstanding success for which we will be getting incremental rent. We are working with our operating partners to help them understand the way in which we can provide capital for expansion improvements, reprogramming especially as they continue to see demand levels that are really just outstanding. I mean, very - a moment ago, mentioned how strong the operating results are and I just can't help looking for an excuse to mention the fact that when Sands announced, I guess it was last week, they reported 98% occupancy in the month of June. No international travel. Not much convention business yet, 98% occupancy. And as you all know, they've got over 7,000 rooms. And at 98%, that means almost 7,000 room nights, a nights sold. Each night in the month of June with again, no international travel and very little citywide convention business yet, and yet that business is coming towards the back end of the year. So our operators are certainly looking at scenarios where they're realizing there can be opportunities for expanding their capacity in one way or another or reprogramming in one way or another to take advantage of what is just outstanding levels of demand. John? Yes, Michael, it's a good question and to hear from you. A grounds saying that execution happens at the intersection of opportunity and strategy. And what you've seen from it so far, Michael, in terms of both Chelsea Piers and Great Wolf was seizing on an opportunity. In each case, we did not have at the time we did the deal, the opportunity to buy the real estate either by a leasehold interest, which would be possible. Eventually it's easy peers or buy into the asset, either in a stage of development or fully developed. So we're using the financing vehicle in the way David described is a way to have a seat at the table such that if there is an opportunity to become the real estate owner in the future, we have a ringside seat in order to do so. And again, we're going to continue to tell every field we can really come into contact with. And certainly, our first choice will always be to buy real estate, whether it be simple or buying long-term leasehold interest if it meets our investment criteria. But again, we're not going to be doctrinaire, we're going to be opportunistic if we think the right risk/reward profile is there. And in the case of these 2 opportunities, I mean we just could not be more excited. Chelsea Piers, as you well know, it's just up the street premium as a comparable asset. And I'm not sure it's fully appreciated. It's not only New York's foremost recreation asset, it's Manhattan's best film production studios. And you don't need me to tell you with the news this morning about Hudson Pacific and Blackstone partnering on the development of new studio space in L.A. That is one really hot category right now and likely to stay so for the long term. So again, this is a bit of a long-winded answer, but we're going to use every tool in the toolbox to get a ringside seat for opportunities to grow our portfolio accretively over the long term. Yes. I mean in the case of Chelsea Piers, we couldn't put a highly specific timetable on it. But what I will tell you is that as we work with Chelsea Piers, one of the key things to keep in mind is that we like to partner with companies that are intent on growing and growing requires capital. And that's where we believe we probably can get our best traction over time, Michael. If it was just 1 operator with 1 asset, and that's all they ever wanted, our chances of doing something are what they are. But with operators who want to grow and who will require capital to do so, that's where we think the opportunity is I couldn't put a precise timetable on Chelsea Piers, but we are very excited about their growth ambitions. And in the case of Blackstone and Great Wolf, they've spilled out their growth ambitions. They're very expensive. And as David spoke of in his comments, we have the opportunity to keep funding them for quite a period of time, and hopefully be there with a very compelling offer there's an opportunity to become the owner of the real estate. Yes. I'll turn that part of the question over to David. Yes. One thing I just want to add, Michael, is that one thing that our embedded growth pipeline does give us the ability to do is invest time and energy in the developing of relationships that may not pay off for years. But nonetheless, we want to do that. An example of that was when John Payne started calling on Rob Goldstein, the CEO of Las Vegas Sands a couple of years ago with some of us going, yes, okay, go ahead, John. We're not sure that ever going to pay off. And obviously, it has. And similarly, whether it be in gaming or nongaming, our business model allows us to invest time into relationships that if we grow those relationships successfully, they represent our future growth in the years to come. And if we're investing time in a relationship here in 2021 that pays off in 2025, we feel we're actually doing our jobs right. But again, our business model allows us to do that in a way that some of the REIT management teams may not enjoy. Yes. I think we're into double digits, John and David. I mean we're in the categories day by day that frankly, we weren't even on our radar 2 years ago. But as we evaluate them, we see the 4 things we most want, which is low cyclicality, no secular threat, healthy supply-demand balance and a durable end user experience. It's again, proven its durability for decades going backwards and promises to be durable for decades going forward. And there's a lot of white space out there, Michael, that the opco propco model has not pioneered that we think has the potential to be pioneered, especially within experiential sectors that have demographic tailwinds behind them for the next 10, 20 years that promise real growth opportunity to the operator, which will require capital, which we are so thrilled to provide. David. Before John - before John and David answered that question, John DeCree, I just wanted to point out, but everyone's benefit, the name of the firm that you are now associated with. Union Gaming, having become part of CBRE, I think is evidence of the fact that real estate - gaming real estate is in the institutionalization process when a company of the stature in global commercial real estate of CBRE besides this is the game that need to start playing in. So anyway, congratulations, John, and over to you, John Payne and David Kieske. It's a good - maybe hard to answer question, John. I do think so much of the answer comes down to what would the recipient of the proceeds do with the proceeds, right? And I think what you're seeing so far, John, is that the propco model, the participation of a REIT is really valuable when an operator wants to grow and/or when an owner of an asset wants to exit entirely. You've not seen a whole lot of sale leasebacks undertaken for the sheer sake of financial engineering at this point, right? Which is probably healthy and sound. I mean, this should be done when an operator has a compelling use for the proceeds, whether to reinvest in their business, to grow their business, or otherwise achieve liquidity or for partners who need that liquidity. There is no question, John, that the fullest value of an asset will be realized with an opco propco model. It's really going to be up to the owners of the assets as to how they want to crystallize their value and when they want to. And to be honest with you, selfishly, if this is a process that takes years to unfold that's better. Because if it unfolds over many years to come, which I think is actually probably the likely bet, it produces a more sustained growth pipeline and gaming real estate. David? Yes. And John, if I were going to on [indiscernible], which maybe a weakness for, I would say that the power center of the future won't be retail, it will be experiential. And as John Payne could attest to, it's actually American tribal gaming operators who are really the first in gaming to realize that they have the opportunity to create experiential power centers around so many of the amazing assets that they've developed and are operating. Go ahead, John. John? Yes. Thank you, operator, and thanks, everybody. We're excited about the continuing institutionalization of gaming as a real estate asset class and believe we are well positioned to continue driving spirit shareholder - superior shareholder value. Again, thanks and good health to all. Bye for now."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As many of you may recall, in March of this year, we announced the pending acquisition of the real estate of the Venetian Resort and Sam's Expo Center in Las Vegas. Upon closing, this $4 billion acquisition will add $250 million of annualized rent, growing VICI revenue base by nearly 20%, and is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share. We agreed to acquire this iconic world-class asset in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip at a 6.25% cap rate. And just a few weeks ago, another real estate acquisition was announced in Las Vegas with Blackstone agreeing to acquire City Center's real estate from MGM at a 5.5% cap rate. The City Center transaction illustrates what we have been foreshadowing since our company was created. That is, when institutional capital realizes the discount between the incredible quality of gaming real estate and the undemanding valuation relative to other real estate asset classes. The days of the 10% cap rate transactions are over. Our acquisition of the Venetian real estate was announced at a very idiosyncratic time, during which the recovery trajectory in Las Vegas was unclear. We were highly optimistic as reflected in the 6.25% cap rate and prudently structured a transaction that worked for all parties while creating significant value for our shareholders. As those of you who follow the industry closely are undoubtedly aware, visitation, occupancy and consumer spend have continued accelerating in Las Vegas and operating margin expansion has become apparent. Midweek demand has been supported by the early return of meetings and conventions and the outlook for the back half of 2021 and 2022 is very promising. Similar to regional markets, Las Vegas is benefiting from very robust consumer demand and a new, more efficient operating model. As I've said before, the gaming consumer did not find a replacement for the bricks-and-mortar experience through COVID, not in the regional markets, and not in Las Vegas. As you can imagine, underwriting transactions during this time can be challenging. Each market and asset has unique attributes. The EBITDAR you consider underwriting 1 day could be significantly behind real-time performance just a few weeks later. No doubt this makes underwriting and negotiating a potential deal, a fun and creative challenge. We're fortunate our team has the ability and experience to manage this complexity. We thrive on this challenge, and we continue working relentlessly to execute compelling opportunities that deliver the utmost value for our shareholders. I now will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our recent investment outside of gaming and our financial results. David? Yes. I mean, look, we haven't changed our plans. I continue to do, as David just said, with a great full team and the Blackstone team and other operators in gaming and outside game and continue to build what those companies are trying to do to grow? Is there a spot for us to help them grow as a partner for the long term? So I don't know what exactly is ahead of us, but we're continuing to be out there and build those relationships. And Dan, if I can just add to that as well. Just as a few years ago, when we started BK, you heard me on these calls talk about continuing to work with gaming operators to educate them on how a REIT like ours could help them in their capital stack and how we could help them grow. We're doing a lot of that in the - in some of these nongaming sectors as well as they're getting introduced to our company and our form of financing. And we're spending a lot of time doing that. And hopefully, that will lead to some accretive and exciting opportunities for us in the 1 or 2 years as you mentioned. Well, it's definitely - there's no doubt having some expertise in this space is quite important. These are, as David talked about, the nongaming assets being complex, our gaming - our tenants have very complex assets. And really, over the past 18 months, the business has changed dramatically. And so understanding how the business has changed and what is the long-term outlook of the business is critically important. And then understanding how these companies are going to grow by meeting with the C suites is important. And there's no doubt that you've heard us talk about the importance of relationships. These are long-term deals when we do these things. And so it is important to have those relationships and the understanding of the core business and how it's going to perform over the years to come. So I'd say that's a long saying Barry, that it is important. We think it's an important part of the VICI's - our plans. Yes. Just to say, Wes, I think you're asking about our current tenants and our current assets. Yes, it's the responsibility of our tenants to do that. We obviously have some visibility to projects that that they're going to - big projects that they're going to put forth. We also have in our leases, some obligations, the size of investment that they make into our assets. But it really is the obligation of the tenant or the operator to make those capital investments. Yes, it's been interesting, Wes, as this has been rolled out nationwide, there's been markets that started nonsmoking, Ohio, in particular, is a market that started out and still is nonsmoking. But what you heard Ed mention is the operators have created these outdoor facilities that allow smoking. And I think it's just to meet the demand of particular customer segments that want to smoke while they gamble. There are other states and cities even that are passing nonsmoking just have to monitor if that ultimately affects the business long term. But what Ed was mentioning is Ohio is a state that actually is non-smoking, but we help Jack develop a smoking area that is outside. Stephen, it's John. It's a great question. I'll start by saying, boy, a lot of props to the operators in the gaming business right now. I mean our tenants - our public tenants have not announced their earnings, but you saw the earnings at Boyd and Red Rock and Monarch and Churchill and Sam's and others out there. And you do have to say, kudos to them for reinventing their business during this very tough time and showing incredible operating margins. I'll answer the question by saying, you really have to take an asset by asset, Stephen. You really have to go through and understand if there's an asset that's seeing considerable growth through the 2019 numbers, where are they getting and what segments they're getting and what margin are they getting it? How did they increase their margin? And this goes to my opening remarks by saying having expertise in our organization to be able to dig in, it allows you, if you are going to do a deal and do underwrite during this unique time to get a real good number that you're comfortable with on the EBITDAR level. And those are the type of things we'll do if there's an opportunity. Yes. Congrats, John. And John, to your question about the 2 Indiana tracks and casinos in Indianapolis. Our tenant has done a great job in taking those businesses over. You've probably been tracking the revenue levels there. They've also committed to large capital projects to both of those assets as table games has started at those 2 assets. There wasn't table games before that. Those construction projects continue. The business will take a little bit of time to stabilize after they get the capital projects in place. As you mentioned, the put call becomes active. It's 6 months from now. So we'll continue to watch these assets, see them grow. Obviously, we're partners with Caesars. The operator will continue to talk to Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker and understand what's going on there, and then we'll see how it ultimately plays out with the put call on the timing. We're very excited about what Tom Reeg and Bret and Anthony Cronto announced about our marquee asset and addressing the entrants and making it more welcoming. I think that's going to be a fantastic project. I think you're talking about the acreage that we own that's part of the Las Vegas lease in front of Caesars Palace. And I think that, that is just a great piece of real estate that I know my partners at Caesars continue to look at what is the most appropriate development that goes there for the long term of Las Vegas and bring that casino out to the strip. And I know they're continuing to look at it. So I'm not sure there's a connection between the making the front entrance right now more accessible and the new development. But I do know that, over time, it's a great piece of real estate that could be developed into just some world-class opportunity to attract more customers to that building. I don't... Yes. I don't think it's - I was going to stress earlier when we were talking a lot about the nongaming opportunity as we're clearly spending time doing that. It's not an either or David talked about this earlier, and we've been talking about this for a couple of years is we've got capacity to do both. We see a nice runway in gaming. We're going to continue to build relationships in gaming, which should lead as it has for 3.5 years to accretive gaming deals. But we have the capacity now to look in other sectors and other opportunities that fit within our portfolio and that would work for our shareholders. So it's important to know it's not it's not an either where we have the ability to do both, and we're going to continue to do both. Yes, it's a good question, and we'll continue to monitor. I think you know when the casinos opened in Las Vegas and had tremendous demand at the beginning when they open, they did require a mask for employees and for customers. And then it's been over the past couple of months where masks have been removed. And as you said, Clark County is saying that the mass need to come back for the operators, for the employees and the guests. So we'll continue to monitor it as the entire United States is. But as we saw when the casinos opened up, there still is a tremendous amount of demand for Las Vegas and for the assets that we own the real estate for our operators. So just more to come, but they have gone through this before the end of 2020 and the beginning of '21 and they're prepared, and I'm sure there'll be another opportunity where mask will be removed, but we'll monitor that accordingly."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, John. I'll discuss our exciting new partnership with Great Wolf and touch briefly on our balance sheet and liquidity and give a summary of our financial results and guidance, all of which is fully detailed in the press release we posted last night. During the quarter, we continued to expand our investments outside of gaming by entering into a mezzanine loan agreement with Great Wolf Resorts, a Blackstone portfolio company. On June 16, we agreed to provide $79.5 million to partially fund the development of the Great Wolf Lodge Maryland, an expansive 48-acre indoor water park resort located in Perryville, Maryland. The loan bears an interest rate of 8% and has an initial term of 3 years with 2 12-month extension options. We will fund our commitment using cash on our balance sheet and expect to fund our entire $79.5 million commitment by mid-2022 in accordance with the construction draw schedule. In addition, we'll have the opportunity for a period up to 5 years to provide up to a total of $300 million of mezzanine financing for the development and construction of Great Wolf's extensive domestic and international indoor water park resort pipeline. We are thrilled to partner with Great Wolf, the leading indoor waterpark resort platform and institutional operator. During the quarter, we entered into a new $1 billion ATM agreement with the added flexibility to sell shares through forward sale agreements under the ATM. We've not sold any shares under the ATM in 2021. Our outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.01%. The weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately 5.6 years, and we have no debt maturing until 2024. As of June 30, our net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA was approximately 5.0x. We currently have approximately $3.8 billion in liquidity, comprised of $407.5 million in cash on hand, $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is undrawn. And in addition, we have access to approximately $527.6 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares under the June 2020 forward and approximately $1.9 billion from the future settlement of the 69 million shares under the March 2021 forward, which we intend to use to fund a portion of the Venetian acquisition, which John mentioned. Turning to financial results. And just one minor point to note in the earnings release. In the total revenue summary under second quarter results, the 8-K refers to a noncash leasing and financing adjustment of a negative $29.3 million. This should instead be a positive $29.3 million. Reported total revenues in this summary are otherwise correct. AFFO for the quarter was $256.1 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 45.3% over Q2 2020. As a reminder, our diluted share count includes the impact of treasury accounting during the period of time, the forward sale agreements are in place. During the second quarter, the impact of treasury accounting on our diluted share count was approximately 17.4 million shares. Our G&A was $7.6 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2%, which represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for the full year 2021 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning in January 2020, we were required to implement the CECL accounting standard which, due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We continue to expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021, to be between $1.010 billion and $1.035 billion or between $1.82 and $1.87 per diluted share. These per share estimates reflect the dilutive impact of the 20 - reflect the dilutive impact of the pending 26.9 million shares related to the June 2020 forward sale agreement assuming settlement and the issuance of such shares on December 17, 2021, the amended maturity date of the June 2020 forward as well as the dilutive effect of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forward sale agreement. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, Greg, great to talk to you. I'm going to take that in reverse order. I mean we've spent over 2 years studying the indoor waterpark resort sector. And I've just come to be enamored with it. We're thrilled to partner with Great Wolf, who is the leader in the sector and has a phenomenal institutional platform led by Murray and team in Chicago. The cash flows, they're essentially casinos without gaming. There are multiple revenue drivers in terms of the indoor water park component, the family entertainment center, the food and beverage. So we've talked about gaming, multiple levers within a box. And it's not just a box. It's a very complex box. These are very expensive assets to build that have a very, very durable customer base durable customer experience, which we come to love. So high-margin business and similar to gaming, they were shut down during COVID, but they've reopened. The customer has returned and customers returned in droves, and they've opened under a new operating model with higher profitability and higher margins. In terms of addressable market, Great Wolf is the leader. There's 19 Great Wolfs out there. This will be #20. We hope to continue to grow the platform with Great Wolf. And this is a sector that we will continue to kind of study look at and hopefully, over time, convert into real estate ownership if and when the opportunity arises. We've - the team with Ed, John, myself, we've got great relationships. Our Chief Accounting Officer came from Blackstone. So we have good relationships with a lot of operators in these - as John has talked about, we've been out meeting with operators since day 1, both in and outside of gaming. And we've developed a relationship with the Great Wolf team and the Blackstone team and we're able to together a very collaborative transaction that worked for both parties. Yes. Thanks, Dan. Look, just in terms of the loan, I mean, we use the loan - the loan tool kit as a pathway to potential real estate ownership. So we do expect to expand - continue to expand outside of gaming. But as we've been very vocal about, it's not an either or. The majority of our investments will be gaming just as Ed talked about, the magnitude of the assets, the magnitude of the cash flows. But we will look to continue to partner with great operators and owned real estate with great operators to help them grow their portfolios, whether through direct ownership or the continued use of the mortgage financing tool that we've been successful with to date. Yes. We know - exactly, and it's good to talk to you. And we've mentioned this before that our phones didn't stop ringing during COVID and some of the calls that we got were new entrants looking at gaming. And I think those new entrants are continuing to look at gaming, both within Vegas and outside of Vegas because - and these are primarily private capital sources who have historically invested in leisure, hospitality, entertainment companies, and they're almost through cash burn cycles. They're talking about cash burn, but they're looking at gaming, realizing, wow, how do I get into that sector? How do I potentially partner with somebody in that sector? How do I develop a platform in that sector? So I think you'll see more in the regional markets as time goes on here, just again, given the resiliency and quality of these cash flows. Yes, we've been very consistent. We - as I mentioned in my remarks, we have about $2.4 billion of equity sitting in the forward. So that's - and then we will go to the debt markets later in the fall, unsecured high-yield markets to get to remaining $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion of proceeds to fund our $4 billion commitment for the Venetian. And our 10-year paper or 10-year quotes we've gotten recently is sub-4 kind of 3.5% to 4% range. Obviously, that bounces around a little bit with the markets, but we still feel very confident of our underwriting and the accretion we'll achieve from that transaction. Michael, good to talk to you. As it relates to Gray Wolf, we do have a similar ROFO in place with Great Wolf in the event they like to sell. So similar as they talked about with Chelsea Piers, they may or may not like to sell single assets. But it's - what this does is gives us a seat at the table. And we will get monthly reporting information. We'll have - we have a very good dialogue with Murray and team, who runs Great Wolf, and we have a very good dialogue with the Blackstone team that will ultimately look to monetize this. So being in the mix and being in that flow keeps us close to the opportunity to secure long-term real estate. And part of our ability, part of what we bring to the table is that next slug of capital. There is - it's Great Wolf put out in our press release, JPMorgan has the senior loan on this Perryville development. And as you know, or you can talk to colleagues in the rest of the Citi Group organization, construction financing is not a deep bucket of financing. So for us to be able to provide the mezzanine component for this asset and a handful of many more. That's a very attractive piece of capital, especially when Great Wolf is out talking to securing future sites and being able to demonstrate that they have the capital and ready to go for future development. So there is a 5-year term, obviously, on the mezzanine piece, but we don't have - we don't believe it will be repaid quickly, and it will take 2 years to develop and then a little bit of time to stabilize. So while it's not a 35-year lease. We do like the investment and we do like what it opens up for us. It's David. Look, as I talked about, we reiterated our guidance of $1.82 to $1.87. John touched on the fact we'll get $250 million of incremental rent. And we think with an additional $1.5 billion of debt in and around 4%, you could probably - you can get pretty close to the AFFO impact there. John, good to talk to you. The proximity of the Perryville Colocation was not part of the discussion. I think what it does is create a very - such to create an experiential entertainment center, which will be great both for the Great Wolf asset as well as PEM and GLPI who owned that real estate. But Great Wolf was able to secure the site. It's right off of 95. It's - as you've seen with the indoor water park resorts over time, closer to the core as this sector has become more institutionalized, you go back several years. They were further away from urban areas and cheaper land in areas that were a little bit cheaper to build. So this is just a continued institutionalization of the indoor water park sector. As it relates to our lands, if there's an opportunity with 1 of our tenants to put into a water park on [indiscernible] we would be happy to provide capital for. Exactly Jay, it's David. We don't have any guidance. I have to ask Great Wolf. But we do know that they've got a very robust pipeline. And as I mentioned, their customer continued to want to visit the water parks even and get back out and they've seen a very big resurgence in their bookings and their activity at their assets. So they're seeing a great opportunity to expand the platform here, and we excited to partner with them on that."

Forward-looking statements, which are generally identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, project or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our first quarter 2021 earnings release and our supplemental information available on the VICI Properties website. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, Samantha. Good morning to everyone on the line and thanks very much for joining us today. Some of you may recall that I started our last earnings call on February 19, by pointing out the pre-call commentary on our earnings release concerning Q4 2020 and full-year 2020, pretty much to be still down to VICI meets consensus. And me being me, I couldn\u2019t help more or less in reality consensus kind of messes the point. This is why I actually said exactly. Did VICI achieve consensus is of course a key question, but we think it's also worth asking the consensus call for AFFO per share growing, staying steady or declining. If it called for growth, was it a lot of growth or a little of growth. In VICI\u2019s case, we reported what we believe at the time back again on February 19, we proved to be a lot of growth, 10.8% AFFO growth for full-year 2020 and 24.3% AFFO growth for Q4 2020. Now with the Q4 2020 reporting period is well behind us, we know with certainty that VICI did indeed post the highest AFFO per share growth of any American triple-net REIT in 2020 for the year and in Q4 2020. 12 out of 19 American triple-net REITs reported AFFO per share declines in 2020. Among those triple-net REITs that grew that closes the VICI achieved 7.0% AFFO per share growth for 2020 for the year and 11.8% growth for Q4 2020. The average AFFO per share year-over-year change, and I\u2019m emphasizing the word change and I don\u2019t want to use the word growth because negative growth is an oxymoron. The year-over-year change in triple-net REITs in 2020 was on average negative 6.9%. As on February 19 and is one of the few REITs to restore guidance, we announced 2021 guidance calling for between $1.82 and $1.87 of AFFO per share. In a moment, David will reaffirm that guidance. If in 2021, we achieved the midpoint of our guidance, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth will be approximately 12%. If you measure AFFO per share growth from 2019 to the midpoint of our 2021 guidance, you end up with the growth rate for that period that two-year, three-year period of approximately 25%. To put VICI's earnings growth into perspective, we encourage those who own our stock and those who follow us to dust off that old-school metric known as the price earnings growth ratio or PEG ratio. In the case of VICI or any other REIT that reports AFFO, we calculate PEG ratio by comparing the current AFFO earnings multiple to the projected AFFO per share growth rate. These two numbers, the AFFO multiple and the AFFO per share growth rate percentage, are then expressed in ratio to each other. A REIT that at a 16-time multiple of AFFO and has projected AFFO per share earnings growth of 16% would be said to have a PEG ratio of 1:1. A REIT that trades at a 16 times AFFO multiple and has projected AFFO per share earnings growth of 8% would have a PEG ratio of 2:1. Obviously, the lower the PEG ratio, the less you are paying for growth. The higher the PEG ratio, the more you are paying for growth if any is there. We encourage you to look at the current PEG ratios for America's triple-net REIT because 2020 was a decline year for so many triple-nets again 12 out of 19 triple-nets are AFFO per share declines in 2020. We suggest you look at their PEG ratios over the period of 2019 through 2021. Take each triple-net REIT's actual 2019 AFFO per share as the base, measure that against 2021 consensus AFFO per share and then compare the resulting percentage of change against the current AFFO multiple of the REIT. To make the measurement meaningful, you'll need to eliminate those triple-net REITs to show lower AFFO per share in 2021 than they did in 2019. And that, in fact, means, you have to eliminate eighth of the 18 triple-net REITs, excluding VICI, in our sample group. Yes, according to FactSet, eight of these 18 triple-net REIT shows consensus AFFO per share earnings for 2021 that are lower than 2019. Based on data either publicly available or through FactSet, the resulting average PEG ratio for triple-net REITs that showed 2019 to 2021 AFFO per share growth, again excluding VICI, is the PEG ratio of 2.5 to 1, meaning, of course, at the average current AFFO multiple for these REITs of 17.5, it's 2.5 times the average expected AFFO per share growth rate percentage of 7% for the period of 2019 through 2021. We encourage you to calculate VICI\u2019s PEG ratio based on our current AFFO multiple and our projected AFFO growth percentage based on the mid-point of our guidance. Whether you measure our growth percentage for 2021 versus 2020, a period for which the midpoint of our 2021 guidance yields 12% growth in AFFO per share or 2019, a period for which the midpoint of our 2021 guidance yields 25% growth in the AFFO per share, we are confident you will end up with a VICI PEG ratio that stands up very well to the triple-net REIT group and likely any other American REIT out there. The follow-on question of course is, \u201cWell, VICI, what about next year 2022 and the years after that?\u201d Bear with me just a second. I'm now going to turn the call over to John Payne. He will tell you about our drivers of AFFO growth in 2022. And for the period beyond 2022, we believe VICI stockholders can feel confident in our robust embedded pipeline of property acquisition opportunities and as well our strong record at sourcing, executing and funding open market deal flow. John, over to you.\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. The first quarter of this year was a very exciting quarter for our company. On March 3, we announced the acquisition of the real estate of the iconic Venetian Resort in Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas. Upon closing this $4 billion acquisition will add $250 million of annualized rent growing VICI's revenue base by nearly 20% and is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share. Importantly, we're acquiring over 8 million square feet of world-class real estate along the center of gravity on the Las Vegas Strip. The Venetian Complex is one of the top revenue generating real estate asset in the world and we are thrilled to acquire this property at a discount to replacement cost and at an accretive spread to our cost of capital. The Venetian checks many of the boxes that are crucial too successful real-estate investing. 1) Quality real-estate in a prime location. 2) Robust rent protection through an effective guarantee from an investment grade entity through 2023 followed by significant property level covenant protection. And 3) An incredible organization running the operations which will be supported by a palette of vast resources and incentivized by their own business model to grow profitably which ultimately enhances our rent coverage. Many of you closely follow the gaming Operators have undoubtedly heard that there recovering Las Vegas is accelerating. We hear customers have already returned in great numbers and convention and meeting bookings continue to grow. We are very bullish on the future of Las Vegas and look forward to growing our portfolio in this geography. In the gaming and leisure markets, our properties continue to showcase strength driven by new stronger operating model that we believe is here to stay. Many assets continue setting records as revamped operating models meet robust and consistent consumer demand. We are proud to be partners with the best-in-class Operators on our tenant roaster in wish them continued success. They deserve the upside there currently there enjoying. Over the past 42 months, we've acquired 14 assets deploying over $12 billion of capital doubling the size of our portfolio or making us the most active REIT in the gaming sector by very wide margin. As many of you understand the nature of our triple-net business model means do not operate or asset manage our properties on a day-to-day basis. This supports our team the ability to study and execute opportunities on behalf of our shareholders. Our diverse team of gaming hospitality and real-estate executives remains busier than ever working tirelessly to create one in America's leading REITs. We're very excited about the potential deal why and we see before, while the nature of gaming transactions are lumpy, we have delivered consistent acquisition activity enhancing our portfolio accretively on fair terms and with appropriate risk protection. From the day we started this company, we have strived to create sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe this is the basic principle should be a fundamental goal any successful independent REIT and we will work tirelessly on your behalf to continue grow in VICI creating sustainable fundamental value by enhancing our real-estate portfolio. Now, we'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance.\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. I'll touch briefly on our balance sheet and liquidity and give a summary of our financial results and guidance which are fully detailed in the press release we built the last night. As we've discussed, in the first quarter we announced our biggest transaction to date the $4 billion acquisition of the real-estate of the Venetian Resort in Sands Expo in Las Vegas which will significantly grow the left side of our balance sheet. Simultaneously, we maintain a relentless focus on our capital structure to immediately access the equity capital markets an approach we've taken to and stay one of this REIT to secure accretive long-term funding and ensure we build the right side of our balance sheet to endure any heavy weather that may come our way. On March 8, we completed a follow-on offering of 69 million shares of common stock in an offering price of $29 per share for growth proceeds of $2 billion through a series of forward sale agreements to fund the equity portion of the Venetian acquisition. Proceeds remain subject to settlement pursuing to the terms of the forward sale agreements. This equity along with an unsecured debt rate that we intent to execute prior to the transaction closing provides VICI with all the capital needed to acquire this world-class asset on a leverage neutral basis. Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 0.01%, rated average maturity of our debt is approximately 5.9 years, nearly have no debt maturing until 2024. As of March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately 5.4 times. This is in line with our stated range in focus of maintaining net leverage between 5.0 and 5.5 times. So, please note this ratio is not reflective of our true run rate leverage level as it does not include the full impact of income from the Eldorado Caesars transaction, meaning if you take into consideration a full 12 months of rent from that transaction, our pro forma leverage would be at the low end of our stated range. We currently have approximately $3.8 billion in liquidity comprised of $323 million in cash and a $1 billion availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility. In addition, we have access to approximately $537.4 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares under the June 2020 forward and approximately $1.9 billion from the future settlement of the 69 million shares under the March 2021 forward. Turning to financial results, AFFO was $255 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 41.7% over Q1 2020, while our weighted average diluted share count increased approximately 17.1% as a result of the settlement of the June 2019 forward sale agreements, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in June of 2020 ahead of this closing of the Eldorado Caesars transaction. Our G&A was $8.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.2% for the quarter which represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. As Ed mentioned, we are reaffirming AFFO guidance for the full-year 2021, in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning on January 2020, we were required to implement a CECL accounting standard which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Importantly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe, AFFO represents the best way to measure the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We continue to expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021 to be between $1 billion $10 million and $1 billion $35 million or between a $1.82 and a $1.87 per diluted share. The pre-share estimates reflected dilutive impact of the pending 26.9 million shares related to the June 2020 forward sale agreements assuming settlement and the issuance of such shares on December 17, 2021, the amended maturity date of the June 2020 forward as well as the dilutive effect of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forwarded sale agreements. And as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions capital markets activity or other non-recurring transaction. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to start with the Venetian deal, congrats on that. Just curious, what are your expectations for Apollo to potentially do more deals down the road that could get moved into the master lease and offer some cross collateralization?\nSamantha Gallagher: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Hey, Barry, good morning. Good to talk to you. Look, I won't speak for Apollo and their plans of growth. Obviously, they're excited about this asset. We\u2019re excited to be partners with them. I'm sure we'll continue to look at this space as others because of how great the operators have been in recovering from the pandemic. But we didn\u2019t go into it that there'd be other assets rolled into this Venetian lease, but we'll just have to wait and see, Barry.\nBarry Jonas: Got it. Okay, great. And then, City Center just sold two acres on a Strip for $40 million each. Pretty nice comp for you, I guess. But where do you think the market is overall now? And given that number, would you be a buyer or seller of Vegas land here?\nJohn Payne: Barry, good talking to you about this. I sent out a couple of thank you notes when I saw $40 -- $40 million an acre. But in all seriousness, we got land - a tremendous amount of land behind our asset that Harrah's Las Vegas and Caesars has land as well behind their assets that Flamingo and the LINQ, and we continue to look to see if there's opportunities to expand the Strip deep in the Strip there. Whether we\u2019re buyers or sellers, we\u2019re just going to continue to look ways to grow our company accretively and continue to talk to folks to see if there's opportunities to make our assets and to create value with our real estate.\nEd Pitoniak: And, Barry, if I could just add, this is yet another example of investors and other real estate asset classes realizing the value of the Las Vegas Strip, right? And I know, Barry, you've heard us cite in prior conversations the fact that retail real estate along the Strip has traded in the last 10 to 15 years at cap rates that start with either three or four, right? And this trade of those two acres is another indication that retail real estate investment along the Strip us further advanced in terms of valuation and the gaming real estate, but that's part and parcel of the institutionalization story we've been talking about with you for the last 3.5 years. Over time, the world is going to recognize the gaming real estate along that Strip should be considered just as valuable as retail real estate along the Strip for both fundamental reasons and frankly secular reasons.\nBarry Jonas: Awesome. All right. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Stefan for Smedes. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you, do you have any updates regarding a new tenant at the Horseshoe Hammond? And then do you think regulators would be willing to be flexible around timing given they already granted the one-year extension?\nSamantha Gallagher: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, Stefan, good to talk to you this morning. We don\u2019t have any updates from the Indiana gaming regulars. We just have to wait and see their plans. They've always operated in the State of Indiana very fairly, and we'll just have to see how this ultimately plays out over the coming months.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then, you guys were creative in moving outside of the brick-and-mortar casino business with the Chelsea Pierstransaction. And then outside of the credit-enhancing benefits of iGaming, are there any other ways you\u2019re thinking about participating in the growth of iGaming?\nSamantha Gallagher: Yes. I think the - when we look at the emerging trends in gaming, iGaming is obviously an interesting aspect of it. And in this case, I'm not sure if you mean iGaming to also encompass sports betting. And it is sports betting that we as a REIT are most excited about as a secular technology-enabled trend behind the gaming business. As some of you've heard us talk about, gaming is a consumed discretionary sector. Gaming operators compete for consumer discretionary time and consumer discretionary spending. The way you increase your share into more discretionary time in spending is by increasing your share of mind. And the way you increase your share of mind is by increasing your share of voice. So, that you are ultimately top of mind when the consumer makes their spending decisions, spending of both time and money. And what sports betting is doing is giving gaming a much bigger share of voice and that was certainly demonstrated in the announcement Caesars made a week or two ago in terms of their new partnership with the NFL and I believe the seven NFL teams, they also partner with and it's obviously strongly exemplified by the media reach, the media and marketing reach that Barstool gives to Penn, another very important tenant for us. So, that's where our greatest focus is in terms of the emerging digitization of American gaming. We think it's being expressed most powerfully in terms of creating long-term value by greatly expanding the audience for gaming.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you for taking my question. I don\u2019t know who wants to tackle this one. But as you guys speak out there today, Ed, kind of you alluded to it in the prepared remarks, I believe was John talking a little bit about the cost that have been taken out of the businesses and whatnot. When you think about in years past, synergies often drove kind of M&A activity, whether it was the larger portfolios plucking from smaller or vice versa. But synergies were always a big part of acquisition story. When you think about kind of the uncertainty of the future, you think about where kind of trading multiples are today for a lot of these names. And you think about kind of what really is left up on the synergy store would kind of cost us as they expand. Do you - how do you kind of envision the next, call it, six, nine, 12 months of M&A? Obviously, as someone who has been able to get a significant deal done?\nEd Pitoniak: John, you want to start?\nJohn Payne: Yes, I'll start, Carlo. First, I want to give a shout out and just an amazing compliment to all the operators in the gaming space. And the results that are coming out that have been released are really amazing and operate in a new model in a very difficult time and showing margin improvements from 500, 600, all the way up to over a 1,000 basis points, Carlo. It's pretty amazing and sometimes it gets forgotten how hard that is the amount of work that the teams have had to do. And I just - our team has just tremendous respect not only for our tenants, operators who are tenants, but the others in this space. With that said, Carlo, you mentioned it right at the end is since we started the company in \u201817, we've been very active, we've been very fortunate to be able to do a large amount of accretive transactions for our company. And I just don\u2019t see those conversations stopping at least would might play them back on the road back meeting with asset holders and Operators, I can't tell you obviously when the next deal will be for our company. But there is a great understanding now because of the time that we've spent in the other retailer space is how we of our nature can get into their capital stack. So, I think they'll continue those run rate in front of us that we obviously have in our embedded pipeline that even and outside our embedded pipeline.\nEd Pitoniak: So with that, I would add Carlo is that another factor driving in M&A right now and the part of Operators, that network effect is important and it's valuable if we can achieve it. In my own category is, curious on operations obviously they'll demonstrate it very powerfully. There were loads of network effect. And Caesars, Harrah's, last Caesars historically has obviously demonstrated that power of network effect. And I think, with the emergence in sports betting and what should be a very strong tailwind for gaming coming out of COVID, I do think that network effect is a much of factor in driving M&A right now for both bigger and smaller Operators, is that\u2019s stepped my sense in specialty have.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thanks John, thanks Ed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Adam with Loop Capital Markets.\nDaniel Adam: My questions.\nEd Pitoniak: Hi Dan, sure.\nDaniel Adam: So, in light of the major retail that was announced yesterday between Realty Income and very, I guess, what is your latest thinking on M&A not so much from a single property or asset standpoint but more along in the lines of our portfolio of assets or even a merger with another retail pacing triple-net. Does it make sense from your standpoint and are there any accretive opportunities out there for you guys?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, this is a good and intriguing question. And first of all, hats off to Canadian, the team at Realty Income. They are demonstrating what you can achieve when you have a superior cost of capital. Basically, the better and better your cost of capital gets, the wider your funnel gets when it comes to generating growth. I would say for the time being, we are so most fundamentally focused on defining what it will mean in the decade and decades ahead to be an experiential REIT. And at this point, we cannot identify another REIT out there that has a critical mass of experiential real-estate at the kind we want to invest in. But having said that, we are obviously very mindful at the end of every day, the beginning of every day that we work for our shareholders. And if we determine especially in constitution with our shareholders that the time has come when we should be considering such M&A, we will absolutely do so. We're not dogmatic about anything except for the fact that we think we want great real-estate and half of our shareholders. So again, we really do believe that experiential is going to be the best place to invest given the secular trends behind experiential. Those secular trends were already in evidence before COVID. The consumer preference for experience over things were very strong before COVID and when then our aid has proved it during COVID, we're already starting to see come back not only with our Operators but other experiential sectors. And if you combine that secular trends with the demographic trends that are in place whether it'd be baby boomers moving into their prime leisure years and millennials entering family formation. Experientials is really where we want to be. And if we're going to continue to grow our experiential portfolio, we're going to need to do it and want to do it by frankly discovering and mining white space with triple-net REITs that's not conventionally played in.\nDaniel Adam: Thanks for the color, And then David, you've really done a tremendous job over the past three years strengthening the balance sheet. And earlier this month, S&P revise its outlook on VICI to positive from stable. I guess, to the extent we guys get upgraded to investment grades over the next 12 months? What does that mean from an incremental cost of debt perspective and with lower debt cost potentially expand a universe or M&A targets from an accretion standpoint? Thanks.\nDavid Kieske: Yes, thanks Dan. In terms of the incremental improvement in our cost of capital from investment grade, I mean it obviously depends on the debt markets overall but if you look at historical spreads, it's 50 basis points to a 100 basis point or a 150 basis points, sometimes 200 basis points of improvement in rates for investment grades versus rates in the unsecured high yield market which we're currently in. Yes, I think our past with investment grade is probably not quite 12 months, I mean it's 12, 24 months from now is as most folks know we need to get rid of that $2.1 billion term loan that's outstanding in on income where our balance sheet. But, the overall goal from day one is to get to that investment grade credit rating, talking really lower our cost of capital and that exactly your point and then it makes our transactions our ability to pay. Increases our ability to pay and increases the accretion that widens our funnel and allows us to do more accretive deals going forward. So, it's something we're highly focused on and we talk to the agencies frequently and we were pleased to see S&Ps and we look forward that came out to U.S.\nDaniel Adam: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Good morning guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Hi, Rich.\nRich Hightower: Hi, Ed. I was going to say thank you for your profits surreal treatment of the humble PEG ratio. I'm sure that was helpful for everyone.\nEd Pitoniak: You couldn\u2019t see it, Rich. But I was actually smoking a pipe when I did that.\nRich Hightower: That's awesome. I wish I could see that. Well listen, I want to go back to the Venetian deal for a second. And when we think about other private equity involvement in gaming REIT structure so far, it's been in a I guess what I would call a permanent capital structure which I believe might be the thing from Apollo structure and having investment from one of their sort of traditional private equity fund. So, as you think about maybe the risk down the road of a potential exit by Apollo. How do you sort of underwrite that risk and replacing the Operator if I'm thinking about that correctly, how do you sort of PEG that, guys?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start Ed, and turn it over to John and David, Rich. It is obviously a question that we're dealing with or that these dealings will be. What we're very confident at is that Apollo is coming into this with a very clear vision of how to value that how you had been always been working a lot of sectors. And I have never seen the depth of Bill Johnson fall in when underwriting like ISR in this case. They did very much of their credit, they did primary research. Primary, proprietary research to determine among other things what exactly is the outlook of meeting players across America. And I'd say that is one example of the depth that Bill Johnson did lots of this and the credibility they\u2019re bringing to their strategic and their business plan. And then, when it comes down to it, private equity firms obviously tend to exit when they created a lot of value and conceptualize that value. So, our prevalent assumption is, they will exit when the asset is performing very well and when the asset will be very attractive. Would be in whatever structure the exit takes place. And at this point, I don\u2019t think that's predefined, whether by then it's been a platform that gets taken public or whether it's still a single standalone asset. It'll nonetheless be a single standalone asset as John has said in his remarks is, we believe the highest of using few more assets in America's real-estate. So, we really think when about this Rich and excited to see what they're going to do especially --\nRich Hightower: Ed, you still there, sorry I think it's breaking up on me.\nJohn Payne: Rich, this is John, I think we lost Ed in that answer. I think you just going to add an excited, as you've been following the rebound in Las Vegas and I'll quickly that various business obviously the regional business as we've been talking about, quickly that the businesses are rebounding there and the rebooking windows that people are seeing are filling up. So, I think that's how we could end that question.\nRich Hightower: Okay. It sounds very right. Thanks John, I'll hop out of the queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James.\nR.J. Milligan: Good morning, guys. I have a question for Ed, because we have the analyst add on at the start of the call, but John I guess you're going to get it for me.\nJohn Payne: I'll get that one, that won't be as fine with that. So, go ahead.\nR.J. Milligan: I'm sure it'll be a great answer, John.\nJohn Payne: Yes.\nR.J. Milligan: We're still seeing cap rates north of 6% for gaming assets in general and at the same time we're seeing some retail assets, net leased assets trading on the five some even in the fours. And I guess, John do you think cap rates for gaming assets accurately reflect risk today, what potentially pushes them lower and then do you think that would be a positive or negative for VICI?\nJohn Payne: Well, I'm actually going to, David's going to take this answer that we've been talking about this quite a bit. So, David you want to step in and try to get some color while we wait for Ed to come back?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. R.J., I get to get here. And we do first part is to be actually accurately reflect the risk. No, I think we've then why we want to acquire as much as we can in that as we can you really think the risk is mispriced. I think ultimately, people will continue as they have done over the last three plus four five years understand the strength and really demonstrated by the last 12 months if we go back to our call a year ago what we were talking about closings and some every casino in the world. And the business model and the resiliency of our Operators with the ability to maintain rent throughout one of the worst pandemics in history highlights the strength of our cash flows and obviously the resiliency of our real-estate. As John mentioned in his remarks around the levels of conversation and we've factored all of you let this before that there are new entrances looking at gaming because they realize well that's the sector where the consumer hasn\u2019t done the replacement for the experience. And it's a sector that is making money versus other entertainment leisure hospitality sectors that are still talking about cash burn around on turned finally turning the corner from cash burn to slightly cash burn positive. So, I think that's the opening driver that continues to push cap rates lower because you have more entrance and more fluidity in the transaction market like you see in broader real-estate sectors.\nR.J. Milligan: And so, if that does happen over time, do that then increase the desire for which you'd go out and look at non-gaming assets?\nDavid Kieske: I don\u2019t think it's in either or gaming by the magnitude is the of the assets and the cash reserves, the majority of our spectrum, but -- mostly peers and we've talked to with all of you in the past. We stood the other sectors and meet with other Operators to understand where we might be able to expand into non-gaming and states that may not have gaming to give us a diversified portfolio real-estate or with Operators like the Chelsea Piers team, does have a have a phenomenal business model that are essentially casinos without gaming that have multiple levers, multiple business drivers, multiple revenue streams and a customer base that is very varied resilient and some loyal to that experience.\nR.J. Milligan: Great, thanks David.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jordan Bender, Macquarie.\nJordan Bender: Hi, good morning. Are you starting to see the number of companies looking or bidding on the assets increasing from pre-COVID levels? I guess, what I can make here is was the Venetian bidding process more competitive in what you've might have seen pre-2020?\nJohn Payne: This is John, I'll answer that. We've seen many competitive good processes during our time over the past four years. Obviously, if you're in the business of gaining or you're in the business of real-estate that by the gaming assets and you're not interested in the Venetian, I'm not sure where you're spending your time. I mean, this is an irreplaceable iconic world-class asset center-of-the-Strip located. And so, it was a competitive process. There were people who were interested in this asset as many would be and we're again we're fortunate to partner with Apollo and come up with the structure that ultimately got the transaction done. I don\u2019t know if there's more or less folks that would be involved in the processes. I will say I'll reiterate what David said, which is because gaming has performed so well coming out of the pandemic and there's still many hospitality or experiential companies talking about cash burn. Compared to the gaming companies, our tenants who are talking about record EBITDA levels, all-time record EBITDA levels and all-time margin heights that I do think it's caught many investors eyes that say well this is a business that the consumer did not find a substitute during this pandemic, we should look into it. And so, that leads to more competition, we'll just have to after see.\nJordan Bender: And then well, coming up on your seven eight years for the whole gaming REIT sector and we're sitting there roughly $3 billion to $3.5 billion of rental revenue across this space. I was just wondering you can go over kind of your term and what you might think is left out there in terms of something that you would look at?\nJohn Payne: You want to take that, David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. I mean, I think what this continue to be as we talked about, more folks looking at gaming, but the overall term continues to grow as you see the expansion of gaming in new jurisdictions, the Dallas and last November where there's six new jurisdictions in new entrance or new proposals for to seeing as Richmond, Virginia, obviously were we have to go for in Denver. So, as we think about the investible universe, we talked to you about $4 billion to $5 billion of buyable rents that's $50 million to $60 million, $70 million in buyable real-estate. But it's not a static number, it's a number that it was beyond that because you think about the ability for Operators to add towers, add rooms, add convention space, and that gives a great funding opportunities for VICI and then the new supply that comes in. Supply can cut both ways, we need to be cognizant of where the new supply is relative to our existing assets. But generally, it's a positive because it creates funding opportunities, increases the term. So, we're very optimistic about the future and our ability to continue to grow consistently year-in and year-out as we've done from day one with this REIT.\nJordan Bender: Awesome. Nice quarter and thanks for the color.\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, Jordan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Payne: Hi, Stephen Grambling.\nStephen Grambling: Hi, Grambling both in our -- follow-up through, I can put as Carlos question on the regional market and strength in margins. As you look at the pipeline, kind of the strength in the regional markets impact, how you think about underwriting corresponding EBITDA coverage on rent.\nJohn Payne: It's a great option, I mean this is where having expertise in-house that have run these assets with myself and Danny and in understanding how they're increasing their margin, where they're increasing their margin, which part of that margin is sustainable, where do we see there would be the risk. And so, as we think about any individual asset or combination of assets, where the margin has increased over the previous year, will study where we think it ultimately land the work with the Operator. If it's a bid process to see where they think it'll land and we'll underwrite accordingly.\nStephen Grambling: And then have seller expectations generally set, had been reset to that same level or how does that as negotiations been evolving?\nJohn Payne: Well, it's not necessary that they set the level. They are forecasting where their business is going to be. They show what the previous three months or six months has been. So, there's actual numbers the forecast numbers. And again, if we're digging into the purchase of the real-estate of an asset with an Operator will dig into the historic EBITDA levels and margin levels where the new levels are and really study what is going to be sustainable. And that's how we'll ultimately come up with the appropriate starting EBITDAR that we underwrite the asset with the tenant if it's the sale I mean, with a current Operator, but say a lease back or with a new tenant, new Operator if it's a complete sale that we're going in with in our scope.\nStephen Grambling: Yes, I guess the question is, is there a aligning spread in terms of expectations from the Operators versus, I mean, the sellers versus what you're thinking here?\nJohn Payne: We'd have to take, honestly you'd have to take that asset by asset and it's hard to say whether there's a widening or not, again will follow our process that we've done to acquire assets over the past three years.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense.\nJohn Payne: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: David, one for you. I know it's talking about escalators have CPI kickers in that. And can you just remind us what one could kick in near term, I think some are after a few years. Thank you.\nDavid Kieske: Yes, thank you Thomas, good to talk to you. Overall, 92% of our rent is subject to CPI kickers. And the biggest one being Caesars both the Regional Master lease and the Las Vegas lease which takes effect every year November 1, so that kicked in that escalated last November. And in terms of, if you look at what didn\u2019t hit it CPI's last year, but just given where CPI was versus the 2% bump in Las Vegas and the 1.5% bump in the regional leases. But, we like our CPI protections at something that we focus on in our leases and something that we think just given with all the talk around inflation out there. It differentiates such from the other two gaming REITs.\nThomas Allen: And then, I have some that don\u2019t kick in for a couple of years or they all good to go this year?\nDavid Kieske: There are certain leases that have kind of a one or two year, three year holiday depending on the lease. Hard Rock is 1.5 for the first four years and it's the greater is 2% of CPI after the Century leases 1% for years two and three and then one in the quarter or CPI had after. So, there is a holiday for depending on the lease and when we end close the transaction for a period of time. So, it somewhat tagged to other portfolio.\nThomas Allen: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: And next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Yes, SMBC. Good morning, everybody. So, on the Venetian, I'm wondering if you would be able to comment on what the cap rate might have been had Sam state on as the Operator. I know you're getting their backing for a few years. But perhaps, the market would have for everything that Apollo is and I don\u2019t mean to throw them under the bus at all but that I wonder if it would have been a different price as Sam state on. Do you sense that or do you think it would had not add an impact on pricing of the asset?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, it's Ed, Rich. Because its talking is bad and I apologize everyone for dropping off hearing my answer to Rich Hightower. That is a very interesting question that no one's actually asked before. It probably would have been a factor given their investment grade. They're obviously very well serviced, they are the I guess multi cap gaining company in the world. So, hypothetically yes potentially. I do think though Rich, it's also worth reiterating that this deals have placed at a very idiosyncratic time in the market. A time in the market where a whole lot of would be bidders or sidelined because of uncertainty. This full process began at a point in late mid-to-late Q4 when the world was well when the U.S. was at a point of COVID resurgence that was causing a lot of uncertainty. And that's we were able to take action with Apollo at a time when many others couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t. And that is that too was a fundamental factor in the price we ended up paying.\nRich Anderson: They say never waste a good crisis. So, obviously excellent transaction for all parties. The other question I have is and sort of alluded to earlier in the call, but I didn\u2019t really get quite the answer in terms of future M&A and other Operators engaging with REITs. What do you think the main holdback is for anybody who's not sort of done business with the gaming REITs. What's the negotiating hiccup has kept them on the sidelines to this point in and do you expect that you'll see that sort of answer get that question gets answered so that there is even more players involved?\nEd Pitoniak: And just be clear in terms of what you're asking, Rich. This would be what is kept would be sellers from selling?\nRich Anderson: Yes, or Operators you know win for example. Those that have not engaged the REITs in any way to finance their assets.\nEd Pitoniak: I think the most fundamental issue Rich, or the most fundamental question for any Operator is well what would I do with the money. Right?\nRich Anderson: Yes.\nEd Pitoniak: And selling simply for the sake of selling, selling for this simple sake of finance or engineering nonetheless take the question what would I do with the proceeds. And frankly, when John and the rest of our team, we are the Operators. We always say you need a good reason to sell. And that really then breaks into next question is what would you do with the proceeds. And what we really preach frankly is we should have a compelling use for the proceeds and we fundamentally believe that funding growth is a tremendous use of proceeds because if you receive proceeds or a sale lease back, you're receiving proceeds that have the fact though equity. Because we never ask them the money back. And you can then deploy that the factor or preferred equity at a price that is even with the training up or begin your Operators there's still deeper equity and make a raise and we open the market. And I do think one of the dynamics that\u2019s had work right now is the dynamic of network effect of growing store count. And that I think is already creating and we'll continue to create transactional liquidity.\nRich Anderson: Alright, good stuff. Thanks, very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question, you've covered a ton of ground. I just wanted to ask quickly whether there are mature international markets that would be inside or outside the boundary of consideration. Not that you don\u2019t have quite a bit to do domestically but it's just sort of crossed the consciousness.\nSamantha Gallagher: John?\nJohn Payne: David, and good to talk to you, wish I could see you all. Yes David, and these are areas that we continue to looked at, if there's opportunities north of us in Canada or other countries that could fit into our reformat and be good REIT income. We'll continue to understand if there's an opportunity for us. So, we got to pass it at you that we got expertise to look there. You all rightly do have a strong embedded pipeline to continue to grow our company in the coming years without any new deals. But that does not stop, it's from understanding where there could be opportunities more we could help a good sent company grow by monetizing their real-estate.\nDavid Katz: Right. And that could encompass pretty much the entirety of the planet so to speak as long as it meets the criteria?\nJohn Payne: Yes, as long as it meets, we got to understand the tax situation, it will lull the only real-estate, a variety of other things, if they can work we'll tend to look at it.\nDavid Katz: Got it, perfect. Thank you, very much.\nJohn Payne: Thank you.\nEd Pitoniak: I'll just add to David's question that. Our business model is one as well that it enables us puts us in a position that could pave to grow internationally very cost effectively. And just to dramatize the efficiency of our business model. If we use 2018 as a base year, since then on an annualized basis, we\u2019ve grown our rent and because of triple-net that\u2019s our NOI by approximately a billion dollars. And growing our NOI by a billion dollars has passed us only about $1.5 million to $1.8 million of incremental cash to G&A. I feel like, I\u2019m glad it went to heaven with VICI because we can grow and grow very quite protectively and there is no reason that lies well to creating global reach, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree with Union Gaming.\nJohn DeCree: Thanks for taking my question. Covered a lot of ground as David had indicated. So just two questions maybe. One, first on construction costs, we\u2019re seeing those creep up and I think some of your Operators are looking at developing projects. You mentioned a comment in your prepared about the purchase price of an issue being below replacement cost. So, we think about M&A activity and cap rate compression, I think we\u2019re seeing some of the highest increase in construction costs that we have since you guys became public. Are you hearing that from your partners, is that pushing more people to M&A, would you expect that to be a gating factor going as some of your partners look to grow?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. John, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen a lot of evidence yet that commercial construction costs are accelerating anywhere near the way that residential construction costs are accelerating, I mean, like to deploy was gone from 17 bucks to 42 bucks in recent months. But, there is no lot of commercial construction that deals with whole lot of plywood. So, it remains to be seen what will be, in fact, in commercial construction. I could just say though, being in the meeting, convention business as our Operators are especially in Las Vegas. When there is a glorying construction sector in the US that tends to be a very good thing for Las Vegas and for the regional market and not just when Con Agar connects both or the world of concrete shows up. That\u2019s all part and parcel of growing it, really good for our Operators and that\u2019s it for us.\nJohn DeCree: Very true, thanks Ed. And just separate note, the Venetian acquisition increases your exposure of rent going to Las Vegas quite a bit, you probably get this question every quarter and in some capacity also. Lot of your ropers and contracted opportunities are around the Las Vegas Strip, we had talks at length of how attractive the market is. But in the near to medium term, in your M&A or your acquisition approach, do you look to maybe be a little bit more active away from the Las Vegas Strip or is that less of a consideration just given the favorable dynamics that the Strip has right now?\nJohn Payne: Yes. John, good talking to you. When we announced the Venetian, we were very clear that we, after the Venetian is closed, we will still be getting 58% of our rents from regionals and 42% from Las Vegas. And as you mentioned, we do have ropers, but don\u2019t forget the very exciting foot call that we have and two large Indianapolis asset that would be in region. So, I think our plan continues to be to have a diverse portfolio as a mix of Las Vegas and again, you heard me say John, I like the downtown area of Las Vegas, I like the regional part of Las Vegas and I like the Strip where we\u2019ve asset today. And then, I think you all see us continue to add to our portfolio in other region. So the key is that we\u2019re going to remain balanced and diverse as we\u2019ve since we started the company.\nJohn DeCree: Very good, thanks John, thanks Ed.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Peter Hermann with Baird.\nPeter Hermann: VICI open in a mall in Western Pennsylvania of all places, I was wondering if you give us sense for the kind of appetite you think Operators would have in expanding the real said footprint into malls at this particular asset, would form well down the road? Thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, it\u2019s a good question and you\u2019re correct. [Indiscernible] opened a live asset in west mall in Pennsylvania. It would be interesting to watch it with a supplement license in Pennsylvania where they add it, somewhat they call smaller like and you mentioned they\u2019re opened in a mall whether other state beside the licensing process, either add to licenses that are in restrictive stage 4 as new states open specifically saying, we\u2019re going to use it as a redevelopment tool and the site is this mall that\u2019s not doing too well. We just have to wait and see the asset that they built and my understanding is very na\u00efve and is a unique way of using real estate in different way and we will just continue to monitor and I am sure other states are looking at how that all plays out, but I think we\u2019re in early innings there.\nPeter Hermann: I appreciate the response, thank you guys.\nOperator: And your last question comes from James [Indiscernible].\nEd Pitoniak: James, are you there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Can you hear me?\nEd Pitoniak: We can now, yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Following the Venetian transaction, when do you think that implies the value of Caesars power?\nDanny Valoy: Yes that\u2019s a great question that goes out with James. One would think, the value of Caesars power is quite high and it should be as was obviously the value of the garage here when Blackstone made what we think is a tremendously attractive and valuable purchase of brand. And then again MGO brand. Again, doing comparable commercial real estate asset, the revenue productivity, the profit productivity of these assets was really unviable by just about anything else there. When we announced to the nation, we invoked iconic examples or analog like the GM building, like the biggest Amazon distribution center that [Indiscernible] has owned outside of Seattle. These are assets that are just tremendously valuable and we own them and they\u2019re occupied by tenants that are on leases that are effectively 35 years to 5 years and the like. I need to put a fine point out, contracting to buy the Venetian at $4 billion and $250 million of rent, we watered amount of rent, the average triple that we have to do a thousand. A thousand store acquisitions to equal what we bought in the Venetian, right. The top triple-net REIT in America, the average rent per store is $250,000, right. We bought $250 million in one asset and we bought it with the lease term of effectively 50 years weighted average lease term, a lot of these $250,000 boxes is in the same digit. And I think James, as more and more investors into real estate to public equity understand our model of tremendously resilient, a 100% rent, cash rent collection for VICI in 2020 as they realize our weighted average lease terms and they realize that we escalate our rent with GPI tickers. I don\u2019t know if you can find a better viability matching real estate investment especially if you\u2019re a long viability investor like a pension fund, then gain real estate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for the color, Valoy. I\u2019ll leave it on that.\nDanny Valoy: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no more questions at this time.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, operator. Let me just close out by reiterating our thanks to all of you for being on today\u2019s call. We\u2019re proud of the growth that we provided to our stockholders this quarter and believe they\u2019re very well positioned to continue delivering industry leading growth and driving shareholder value. And as John pointed out, we\u2019re very excited about continuing growth prospect of our tenant partners here at the forefront of the reopening of America\u2019s leisure economy. Again thank you and good health to all.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thanks, Samantha. Good morning to everyone on the line and thanks very much for joining us today. Some of you may recall that I started our last earnings call on February 19, by pointing out the pre-call commentary on our earnings release concerning Q4 2020 and full-year 2020, pretty much to be still down to VICI meets consensus. And me being me, I couldn't help more or less in reality consensus kind of messes the point. This is why I actually said exactly. Did VICI achieve consensus is of course a key question, but we think it's also worth asking the consensus call for AFFO per share growing, staying steady or declining. If it called for growth, was it a lot of growth or a little of growth. In VICI's case, we reported what we believe at the time back again on February 19, we proved to be a lot of growth, 10.8% AFFO growth for full-year 2020 and 24.3% AFFO growth for Q4 2020. Now with the Q4 2020 reporting period is well behind us, we know with certainty that VICI did indeed post the highest AFFO per share growth of any American triple-net REIT in 2020 for the year and in Q4 2020. 12 out of 19 American triple-net REITs reported AFFO per share declines in 2020. Among those triple-net REITs that grew that closes the VICI achieved 7.0% AFFO per share growth for 2020 for the year and 11.8% growth for Q4 2020. The average AFFO per share year-over-year change, and I'm emphasizing the word change and I don't want to use the word growth because negative growth is an oxymoron. The year-over-year change in triple-net REITs in 2020 was on average negative 6.9%. As on February 19 and is one of the few REITs to restore guidance, we announced 2021 guidance calling for between $1.82 and $1.87 of AFFO per share. In a moment, David will reaffirm that guidance. If in 2021, we achieved the midpoint of our guidance, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth will be approximately 12%. If you measure AFFO per share growth from 2019 to the midpoint of our 2021 guidance, you end up with the growth rate for that period that two-year, three-year period of approximately 25%. To put VICI's earnings growth into perspective, we encourage those who own our stock and those who follow us to dust off that old-school metric known as the price earnings growth ratio or PEG ratio. In the case of VICI or any other REIT that reports AFFO, we calculate PEG ratio by comparing the current AFFO earnings multiple to the projected AFFO per share growth rate. These two numbers, the AFFO multiple and the AFFO per share growth rate percentage, are then expressed in ratio to each other. A REIT that at a 16-time multiple of AFFO and has projected AFFO per share earnings growth of 16% would be said to have a PEG ratio of 1:1. A REIT that trades at a 16 times AFFO multiple and has projected AFFO per share earnings growth of 8% would have a PEG ratio of 2:1. Obviously, the lower the PEG ratio, the less you are paying for growth. The higher the PEG ratio, the more you are paying for growth if any is there. We encourage you to look at the current PEG ratios for America's triple-net REIT because 2020 was a decline year for so many triple-nets again 12 out of 19 triple-nets are AFFO per share declines in 2020. We suggest you look at their PEG ratios over the period of 2019 through 2021. Take each triple-net REIT's actual 2019 AFFO per share as the base, measure that against 2021 consensus AFFO per share and then compare the resulting percentage of change against the current AFFO multiple of the REIT. To make the measurement meaningful, you'll need to eliminate those triple-net REITs to show lower AFFO per share in 2021 than they did in 2019. And that, in fact, means, you have to eliminate eighth of the 18 triple-net REITs, excluding VICI, in our sample group. Yes, according to FactSet, eight of these 18 triple-net REIT shows consensus AFFO per share earnings for 2021 that are lower than 2019. Based on data either publicly available or through FactSet, the resulting average PEG ratio for triple-net REITs that showed 2019 to 2021 AFFO per share growth, again excluding VICI, is the PEG ratio of 2.5 to 1, meaning, of course, at the average current AFFO multiple for these REITs of 17.5, it's 2.5 times the average expected AFFO per share growth rate percentage of 7% for the period of 2019 through 2021. We encourage you to calculate VICI's PEG ratio based on our current AFFO multiple and our projected AFFO growth percentage based on the mid-point of our guidance. Whether you measure our growth percentage for 2021 versus 2020, a period for which the midpoint of our 2021 guidance yields 12% growth in AFFO per share or 2019, a period for which the midpoint of our 2021 guidance yields 25% growth in the AFFO per share, we are confident you will end up with a VICI PEG ratio that stands up very well to the triple-net REIT group and likely any other American REIT out there. The follow-on question of course is, \u201cWell, VICI, what about next year 2022 and the years after that?\u201d Bear with me just a second. I'm now going to turn the call over to John Payne. He will tell you about our drivers of AFFO growth in 2022. And for the period beyond 2022, we believe VICI stockholders can feel confident in our robust embedded pipeline of property acquisition opportunities and as well our strong record at sourcing, executing and funding open market deal flow. John, over to you. And, Barry, if I could just add, this is yet another example of investors and other real estate asset classes realizing the value of the Las Vegas Strip, right? And I know, Barry, you've heard us cite in prior conversations the fact that retail real estate along the Strip has traded in the last 10 to 15 years at cap rates that start with either three or four, right? And this trade of those two acres is another indication that retail real estate investment along the Strip us further advanced in terms of valuation and the gaming real estate, but that's part and parcel of the institutionalization story we've been talking about with you for the last 3.5 years. Over time, the world is going to recognize the gaming real estate along that Strip should be considered just as valuable as retail real estate along the Strip for both fundamental reasons and frankly secular reasons. John, you want to start? So with that, I would add Carlo is that another factor driving in M&A right now and the part of Operators, that network effect is important and it's valuable if we can achieve it. In my own category is, curious on operations obviously they'll demonstrate it very powerfully. There were loads of network effect. And Caesars, Harrah's, last Caesars historically has obviously demonstrated that power of network effect. And I think, with the emergence in sports betting and what should be a very strong tailwind for gaming coming out of COVID, I do think that network effect is a much of factor in driving M&A right now for both bigger and smaller Operators, is that's stepped my sense in specialty have. Hi Dan, sure. Yes, this is a good and intriguing question. And first of all, hats off to Canadian, the team at Realty Income. They are demonstrating what you can achieve when you have a superior cost of capital. Basically, the better and better your cost of capital gets, the wider your funnel gets when it comes to generating growth. I would say for the time being, we are so most fundamentally focused on defining what it will mean in the decade and decades ahead to be an experiential REIT. And at this point, we cannot identify another REIT out there that has a critical mass of experiential real-estate at the kind we want to invest in. But having said that, we are obviously very mindful at the end of every day, the beginning of every day that we work for our shareholders. And if we determine especially in constitution with our shareholders that the time has come when we should be considering such M&A, we will absolutely do so. We're not dogmatic about anything except for the fact that we think we want great real-estate and half of our shareholders. So again, we really do believe that experiential is going to be the best place to invest given the secular trends behind experiential. Those secular trends were already in evidence before COVID. The consumer preference for experience over things were very strong before COVID and when then our aid has proved it during COVID, we're already starting to see come back not only with our Operators but other experiential sectors. And if you combine that secular trends with the demographic trends that are in place whether it'd be baby boomers moving into their prime leisure years and millennials entering family formation. Experientials is really where we want to be. And if we're going to continue to grow our experiential portfolio, we're going to need to do it and want to do it by frankly discovering and mining white space with triple-net REITs that's not conventionally played in. Thanks, Dan. Hi, Rich. You couldn't see it, Rich. But I was actually smoking a pipe when I did that. Yes. I'll start Ed, and turn it over to John and David, Rich. It is obviously a question that we're dealing with or that these dealings will be. What we're very confident at is that Apollo is coming into this with a very clear vision of how to value that how you had been always been working a lot of sectors. And I have never seen the depth of Bill Johnson fall in when underwriting like ISR in this case. They did very much of their credit, they did primary research. Primary, proprietary research to determine among other things what exactly is the outlook of meeting players across America. And I'd say that is one example of the depth that Bill Johnson did lots of this and the credibility they're bringing to their strategic and their business plan. And then, when it comes down to it, private equity firms obviously tend to exit when they created a lot of value and conceptualize that value. So, our prevalent assumption is, they will exit when the asset is performing very well and when the asset will be very attractive. Would be in whatever structure the exit takes place. And at this point, I don't think that's predefined, whether by then it's been a platform that gets taken public or whether it's still a single standalone asset. It'll nonetheless be a single standalone asset as John has said in his remarks is, we believe the highest of using few more assets in America's real-estate. So, we really think when about this Rich and excited to see what they're going to do especially -- Yes, it's Ed, Rich. Because its talking is bad and I apologize everyone for dropping off hearing my answer to Rich Hightower. That is a very interesting question that no one's actually asked before. It probably would have been a factor given their investment grade. They're obviously very well serviced, they are the I guess multi cap gaining company in the world. So, hypothetically yes potentially. I do think though Rich, it's also worth reiterating that this deals have placed at a very idiosyncratic time in the market. A time in the market where a whole lot of would be bidders or sidelined because of uncertainty. This full process began at a point in late mid-to-late Q4 when the world was well when the U.S. was at a point of COVID resurgence that was causing a lot of uncertainty. And that's we were able to take action with Apollo at a time when many others couldn't or wouldn't. And that is that too was a fundamental factor in the price we ended up paying. And just be clear in terms of what you're asking, Rich. This would be what is kept would be sellers from selling? I think the most fundamental issue Rich, or the most fundamental question for any Operator is well what would I do with the money. Right? And selling simply for the sake of selling, selling for this simple sake of finance or engineering nonetheless take the question what would I do with the proceeds. And frankly, when John and the rest of our team, we are the Operators. We always say you need a good reason to sell. And that really then breaks into next question is what would you do with the proceeds. And what we really preach frankly is we should have a compelling use for the proceeds and we fundamentally believe that funding growth is a tremendous use of proceeds because if you receive proceeds or a sale lease back, you're receiving proceeds that have the fact though equity. Because we never ask them the money back. And you can then deploy that the factor or preferred equity at a price that is even with the training up or begin your Operators there's still deeper equity and make a raise and we open the market. And I do think one of the dynamics that's had work right now is the dynamic of network effect of growing store count. And that I think is already creating and we'll continue to create transactional liquidity. I'll just add to David's question that. Our business model is one as well that it enables us puts us in a position that could pave to grow internationally very cost effectively. And just to dramatize the efficiency of our business model. If we use 2018 as a base year, since then on an annualized basis, we've grown our rent and because of triple-net that's our NOI by approximately a billion dollars. And growing our NOI by a billion dollars has passed us only about $1.5 million to $1.8 million of incremental cash to G&A. I feel like, I'm glad it went to heaven with VICI because we can grow and grow very quite protectively and there is no reason that lies well to creating global reach, David. Yes. John, I don't know that we've seen a lot of evidence yet that commercial construction costs are accelerating anywhere near the way that residential construction costs are accelerating, I mean, like to deploy was gone from 17 bucks to 42 bucks in recent months. But, there is no lot of commercial construction that deals with whole lot of plywood. So, it remains to be seen what will be, in fact, in commercial construction. I could just say though, being in the meeting, convention business as our Operators are especially in Las Vegas. When there is a glorying construction sector in the US that tends to be a very good thing for Las Vegas and for the regional market and not just when Con Agar connects both or the world of concrete shows up. That's all part and parcel of growing it, really good for our Operators and that's it for us. Yes, it's a good question and you're correct. [Indiscernible] opened a live asset in west mall in Pennsylvania. It would be interesting to watch it with a supplement license in Pennsylvania where they add it, somewhat they call smaller like and you mentioned they're opened in a mall whether other state beside the licensing process, either add to licenses that are in restrictive stage 4 as new states open specifically saying, we're going to use it as a redevelopment tool and the site is this mall that's not doing too well. We just have to wait and see the asset that they built and my understanding is very nai\u0308ve and is a unique way of using real estate in different way and we will just continue to monitor and I am sure other states are looking at how that all plays out, but I think we're in early innings there. James, are you there. We can now, yes. Thank you, operator. Let me just close out by reiterating our thanks to all of you for being on today's call. We're proud of the growth that we provided to our stockholders this quarter and believe they're very well positioned to continue delivering industry leading growth and driving shareholder value. And as John pointed out, we're very excited about continuing growth prospect of our tenant partners here at the forefront of the reopening of America's leisure economy. Again thank you and good health to all."

            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. The first quarter of this year was a very exciting quarter for our company. On March 3, we announced the acquisition of the real estate of the iconic Venetian Resort in Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas. Upon closing this $4 billion acquisition will add $250 million of annualized rent growing VICI's revenue base by nearly 20% and is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share. Importantly, we're acquiring over 8 million square feet of world-class real estate along the center of gravity on the Las Vegas Strip. The Venetian Complex is one of the top revenue generating real estate asset in the world and we are thrilled to acquire this property at a discount to replacement cost and at an accretive spread to our cost of capital. The Venetian checks many of the boxes that are crucial too successful real-estate investing. 1) Quality real-estate in a prime location. 2) Robust rent protection through an effective guarantee from an investment grade entity through 2023 followed by significant property level covenant protection. And 3) An incredible organization running the operations which will be supported by a palette of vast resources and incentivized by their own business model to grow profitably which ultimately enhances our rent coverage. Many of you closely follow the gaming Operators have undoubtedly heard that there recovering Las Vegas is accelerating. We hear customers have already returned in great numbers and convention and meeting bookings continue to grow. We are very bullish on the future of Las Vegas and look forward to growing our portfolio in this geography. In the gaming and leisure markets, our properties continue to showcase strength driven by new stronger operating model that we believe is here to stay. Many assets continue setting records as revamped operating models meet robust and consistent consumer demand. We are proud to be partners with the best-in-class Operators on our tenant roaster in wish them continued success. They deserve the upside there currently there enjoying. Over the past 42 months, we've acquired 14 assets deploying over $12 billion of capital doubling the size of our portfolio or making us the most active REIT in the gaming sector by very wide margin. As many of you understand the nature of our triple-net business model means do not operate or asset manage our properties on a day-to-day basis. This supports our team the ability to study and execute opportunities on behalf of our shareholders. Our diverse team of gaming hospitality and real-estate executives remains busier than ever working tirelessly to create one in America's leading REITs. We're very excited about the potential deal why and we see before, while the nature of gaming transactions are lumpy, we have delivered consistent acquisition activity enhancing our portfolio accretively on fair terms and with appropriate risk protection. From the day we started this company, we have strived to create sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe this is the basic principle should be a fundamental goal any successful independent REIT and we will work tirelessly on your behalf to continue grow in VICI creating sustainable fundamental value by enhancing our real-estate portfolio. Now, we'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. Yes. Hey, Barry, good morning. Good to talk to you. Look, I won't speak for Apollo and their plans of growth. Obviously, they're excited about this asset. We're excited to be partners with them. I'm sure we'll continue to look at this space as others because of how great the operators have been in recovering from the pandemic. But we didn't go into it that there'd be other assets rolled into this Venetian lease, but we'll just have to wait and see, Barry. Barry, good talking to you about this. I sent out a couple of thank you notes when I saw $40 -- $40 million an acre. But in all seriousness, we got land - a tremendous amount of land behind our asset that Harrah's Las Vegas and Caesars has land as well behind their assets that Flamingo and the LINQ, and we continue to look to see if there's opportunities to expand the Strip deep in the Strip there. Whether we're buyers or sellers, we're just going to continue to look ways to grow our company accretively and continue to talk to folks to see if there's opportunities to make our assets and to create value with our real estate. Yes, Stefan, good to talk to you this morning. We don't have any updates from the Indiana gaming regulars. We just have to wait and see their plans. They've always operated in the State of Indiana very fairly, and we'll just have to see how this ultimately plays out over the coming months. Yes, I'll start, Carlo. First, I want to give a shout out and just an amazing compliment to all the operators in the gaming space. And the results that are coming out that have been released are really amazing and operate in a new model in a very difficult time and showing margin improvements from 500, 600, all the way up to over a 1,000 basis points, Carlo. It's pretty amazing and sometimes it gets forgotten how hard that is the amount of work that the teams have had to do. And I just - our team has just tremendous respect not only for our tenants, operators who are tenants, but the others in this space. With that said, Carlo, you mentioned it right at the end is since we started the company in \u201817, we've been very active, we've been very fortunate to be able to do a large amount of accretive transactions for our company. And I just don't see those conversations stopping at least would might play them back on the road back meeting with asset holders and Operators, I can't tell you obviously when the next deal will be for our company. But there is a great understanding now because of the time that we've spent in the other retailer space is how we of our nature can get into their capital stack. So, I think they'll continue those run rate in front of us that we obviously have in our embedded pipeline that even and outside our embedded pipeline. Rich, this is John, I think we lost Ed in that answer. I think you just going to add an excited, as you've been following the rebound in Las Vegas and I'll quickly that various business obviously the regional business as we've been talking about, quickly that the businesses are rebounding there and the rebooking windows that people are seeing are filling up. So, I think that's how we could end that question. I'll get that one, that won't be as fine with that. So, go ahead. Yes. Well, I'm actually going to, David's going to take this answer that we've been talking about this quite a bit. So, David you want to step in and try to get some color while we wait for Ed to come back? This is John, I'll answer that. We've seen many competitive good processes during our time over the past four years. Obviously, if you're in the business of gaining or you're in the business of real-estate that by the gaming assets and you're not interested in the Venetian, I'm not sure where you're spending your time. I mean, this is an irreplaceable iconic world-class asset center-of-the-Strip located. And so, it was a competitive process. There were people who were interested in this asset as many would be and we're again we're fortunate to partner with Apollo and come up with the structure that ultimately got the transaction done. I don't know if there's more or less folks that would be involved in the processes. I will say I'll reiterate what David said, which is because gaming has performed so well coming out of the pandemic and there's still many hospitality or experiential companies talking about cash burn. Compared to the gaming companies, our tenants who are talking about record EBITDA levels, all-time record EBITDA levels and all-time margin heights that I do think it's caught many investors eyes that say well this is a business that the consumer did not find a substitute during this pandemic, we should look into it. And so, that leads to more competition, we'll just have to after see. You want to take that, David? Hi, Stephen Grambling. It's a great option, I mean this is where having expertise in-house that have run these assets with myself and Danny and in understanding how they're increasing their margin, where they're increasing their margin, which part of that margin is sustainable, where do we see there would be the risk. And so, as we think about any individual asset or combination of assets, where the margin has increased over the previous year, will study where we think it ultimately land the work with the Operator. If it's a bid process to see where they think it'll land and we'll underwrite accordingly. Well, it's not necessary that they set the level. They are forecasting where their business is going to be. They show what the previous three months or six months has been. So, there's actual numbers the forecast numbers. And again, if we're digging into the purchase of the real-estate of an asset with an Operator will dig into the historic EBITDA levels and margin levels where the new levels are and really study what is going to be sustainable. And that's how we'll ultimately come up with the appropriate starting EBITDAR that we underwrite the asset with the tenant if it's the sale I mean, with a current Operator, but say a lease back or with a new tenant, new Operator if it's a complete sale that we're going in with in our scope. We'd have to take, honestly you'd have to take that asset by asset and it's hard to say whether there's a widening or not, again will follow our process that we've done to acquire assets over the past three years. Thank you. David, and good to talk to you, wish I could see you all. Yes David, and these are areas that we continue to looked at, if there's opportunities north of us in Canada or other countries that could fit into our reformat and be good REIT income. We'll continue to understand if there's an opportunity for us. So, we got to pass it at you that we got expertise to look there. You all rightly do have a strong embedded pipeline to continue to grow our company in the coming years without any new deals. But that does not stop, it's from understanding where there could be opportunities more we could help a good sent company grow by monetizing their real-estate. Yes, as long as it meets, we got to understand the tax situation, it will lull the only real-estate, a variety of other things, if they can work we'll tend to look at it. Thank you. Yes. John, good talking to you. When we announced the Venetian, we were very clear that we, after the Venetian is closed, we will still be getting 58% of our rents from regionals and 42% from Las Vegas. And as you mentioned, we do have ropers, but don't forget the very exciting foot call that we have and two large Indianapolis asset that would be in region. So, I think our plan continues to be to have a diverse portfolio as a mix of Las Vegas and again, you heard me say John, I like the downtown area of Las Vegas, I like the regional part of Las Vegas and I like the Strip where we've asset today. And then, I think you all see us continue to add to our portfolio in other region. So the key is that we're going to remain balanced and diverse as we've since we started the company."

            "name": "Danny Valoy",
            "content": "Yes that's a great question that goes out with James. One would think, the value of Caesars power is quite high and it should be as was obviously the value of the garage here when Blackstone made what we think is a tremendously attractive and valuable purchase of brand. And then again MGO brand. Again, doing comparable commercial real estate asset, the revenue productivity, the profit productivity of these assets was really unviable by just about anything else there. When we announced to the nation, we invoked iconic examples or analog like the GM building, like the biggest Amazon distribution center that [Indiscernible] has owned outside of Seattle. These are assets that are just tremendously valuable and we own them and they're occupied by tenants that are on leases that are effectively 35 years to 5 years and the like. I need to put a fine point out, contracting to buy the Venetian at $4 billion and $250 million of rent, we watered amount of rent, the average triple that we have to do a thousand. A thousand store acquisitions to equal what we bought in the Venetian, right. The top triple-net REIT in America, the average rent per store is $250,000, right. We bought $250 million in one asset and we bought it with the lease term of effectively 50 years weighted average lease term, a lot of these $250,000 boxes is in the same digit. And I think James, as more and more investors into real estate to public equity understand our model of tremendously resilient, a 100% rent, cash rent collection for VICI in 2020 as they realize our weighted average lease terms and they realize that we escalate our rent with GPI tickers. I don't know if you can find a better viability matching real estate investment especially if you're a long viability investor like a pension fund, then gain real estate. Thank you."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. I'll touch briefly on our balance sheet and liquidity and give a summary of our financial results and guidance which are fully detailed in the press release we built the last night. As we've discussed, in the first quarter we announced our biggest transaction to date the $4 billion acquisition of the real-estate of the Venetian Resort in Sands Expo in Las Vegas which will significantly grow the left side of our balance sheet. Simultaneously, we maintain a relentless focus on our capital structure to immediately access the equity capital markets an approach we've taken to and stay one of this REIT to secure accretive long-term funding and ensure we build the right side of our balance sheet to endure any heavy weather that may come our way. On March 8, we completed a follow-on offering of 69 million shares of common stock in an offering price of $29 per share for growth proceeds of $2 billion through a series of forward sale agreements to fund the equity portion of the Venetian acquisition. Proceeds remain subject to settlement pursuing to the terms of the forward sale agreements. This equity along with an unsecured debt rate that we intent to execute prior to the transaction closing provides VICI with all the capital needed to acquire this world-class asset on a leverage neutral basis. Our total outstanding debt at quarter end was $6.9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 0.01%, rated average maturity of our debt is approximately 5.9 years, nearly have no debt maturing until 2024. As of March 31, our net debt to LTM EBITDA was approximately 5.4 times. This is in line with our stated range in focus of maintaining net leverage between 5.0 and 5.5 times. So, please note this ratio is not reflective of our true run rate leverage level as it does not include the full impact of income from the Eldorado Caesars transaction, meaning if you take into consideration a full 12 months of rent from that transaction, our pro forma leverage would be at the low end of our stated range. We currently have approximately $3.8 billion in liquidity comprised of $323 million in cash and a $1 billion availability under our undrawn revolving credit facility. In addition, we have access to approximately $537.4 million in proceeds from the future settlement of the 26.9 million shares under the June 2020 forward and approximately $1.9 billion from the future settlement of the 69 million shares under the March 2021 forward. Turning to financial results, AFFO was $255 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the quarter. Total AFFO increased 41.7% over Q1 2020, while our weighted average diluted share count increased approximately 17.1% as a result of the settlement of the June 2019 forward sale agreements, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet in June of 2020 ahead of this closing of the Eldorado Caesars transaction. Our G&A was $8.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was 2.2% for the quarter which represents one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. As Ed mentioned, we are reaffirming AFFO guidance for the full-year 2021, in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As many of you are aware, beginning on January 2020, we were required to implement a CECL accounting standard which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Importantly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe, AFFO represents the best way to measure the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. We continue to expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021 to be between $1 billion $10 million and $1 billion $35 million or between a $1.82 and a $1.87 per diluted share. The pre-share estimates reflected dilutive impact of the pending 26.9 million shares related to the June 2020 forward sale agreements assuming settlement and the issuance of such shares on December 17, 2021, the amended maturity date of the June 2020 forward as well as the dilutive effect of the pending 69 million shares related to the March 2021 forwarded sale agreements. And as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any pending or possible future acquisitions or dispositions capital markets activity or other non-recurring transaction. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, thanks Dan. In terms of the incremental improvement in our cost of capital from investment grade, I mean it obviously depends on the debt markets overall but if you look at historical spreads, it's 50 basis points to a 100 basis point or a 150 basis points, sometimes 200 basis points of improvement in rates for investment grades versus rates in the unsecured high yield market which we're currently in. Yes, I think our past with investment grade is probably not quite 12 months, I mean it's 12, 24 months from now is as most folks know we need to get rid of that $2.1 billion term loan that's outstanding in on income where our balance sheet. But, the overall goal from day one is to get to that investment grade credit rating, talking really lower our cost of capital and that exactly your point and then it makes our transactions our ability to pay. Increases our ability to pay and increases the accretion that widens our funnel and allows us to do more accretive deals going forward. So, it's something we're highly focused on and we talk to the agencies frequently and we were pleased to see S&Ps and we look forward that came out to U.S. Yes. R.J., I get to get here. And we do first part is to be actually accurately reflect the risk. No, I think we've then why we want to acquire as much as we can in that as we can you really think the risk is mispriced. I think ultimately, people will continue as they have done over the last three plus four five years understand the strength and really demonstrated by the last 12 months if we go back to our call a year ago what we were talking about closings and some every casino in the world. And the business model and the resiliency of our Operators with the ability to maintain rent throughout one of the worst pandemics in history highlights the strength of our cash flows and obviously the resiliency of our real-estate. As John mentioned in his remarks around the levels of conversation and we've factored all of you let this before that there are new entrances looking at gaming because they realize well that's the sector where the consumer hasn't done the replacement for the experience. And it's a sector that is making money versus other entertainment leisure hospitality sectors that are still talking about cash burn around on turned finally turning the corner from cash burn to slightly cash burn positive. So, I think that's the opening driver that continues to push cap rates lower because you have more entrance and more fluidity in the transaction market like you see in broader real-estate sectors. I don't think it's in either or gaming by the magnitude is the of the assets and the cash reserves, the majority of our spectrum, but -- mostly peers and we've talked to with all of you in the past. We stood the other sectors and meet with other Operators to understand where we might be able to expand into non-gaming and states that may not have gaming to give us a diversified portfolio real-estate or with Operators like the Chelsea Piers team, does have a have a phenomenal business model that are essentially casinos without gaming that have multiple levers, multiple business drivers, multiple revenue streams and a customer base that is very varied resilient and some loyal to that experience. Yes. I mean, I think what this continue to be as we talked about, more folks looking at gaming, but the overall term continues to grow as you see the expansion of gaming in new jurisdictions, the Dallas and last November where there's six new jurisdictions in new entrance or new proposals for to seeing as Richmond, Virginia, obviously were we have to go for in Denver. So, as we think about the investible universe, we talked to you about $4 billion to $5 billion of buyable rents that's $50 million to $60 million, $70 million in buyable real-estate. But it's not a static number, it's a number that it was beyond that because you think about the ability for Operators to add towers, add rooms, add convention space, and that gives a great funding opportunities for VICI and then the new supply that comes in. Supply can cut both ways, we need to be cognizant of where the new supply is relative to our existing assets. But generally, it's a positive because it creates funding opportunities, increases the term. So, we're very optimistic about the future and our ability to continue to grow consistently year-in and year-out as we've done from day one with this REIT. Thanks, Jordan. Yes, thank you Thomas, good to talk to you. Overall, 92% of our rent is subject to CPI kickers. And the biggest one being Caesars both the Regional Master lease and the Las Vegas lease which takes effect every year November 1, so that kicked in that escalated last November. And in terms of, if you look at what didn't hit it CPI's last year, but just given where CPI was versus the 2% bump in Las Vegas and the 1.5% bump in the regional leases. But, we like our CPI protections at something that we focus on in our leases and something that we think just given with all the talk around inflation out there. It differentiates such from the other two gaming REITs. There are certain leases that have kind of a one or two year, three year holiday depending on the lease. Hard Rock is 1.5 for the first four years and it's the greater is 2% of CPI after the Century leases 1% for years two and three and then one in the quarter or CPI had after. So, there is a holiday for depending on the lease and when we end close the transaction for a period of time. So, it somewhat tagged to other portfolio."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 24, 2023.  I'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher : Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our fourth quarter 2022 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties described on this call, please refer to the company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Acquisitions. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak : Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to talk to you this morning about our results in 2022 and our outlook for 2023. John will also give you color on our operating environment and business development activities. I'll start by talking about VICI's first 5 years. A couple of weeks ago, we reached the 5-year anniversary of VICI's IPO. I want to thank every single VICI team and Board member for the incredible work they've done over this 5-year period, enabling VICI, among other things, to become the first REIT to go from IPO to S&P 500 inclusion in under 5 years. And I want to thank all of our operating partners in and outside of gaming for the amazing work they do in making our buildings, places a great experiential and economic value. In February of 2018, the time of VICI's IPO, I don't think any of you would have been very excited if I told you that the ensuing 5-year period from VICI IPO through year-end 2022 would be a period in which the S&P 500 Index would generate cumulative total return over that period of 48.5% or that their RMZ REIT index would generate cumulative total return of 27.9%. I want to emphasize those are not annual total return figures. Those are cumulative over the entire period. And that's exactly what the S&P 500 and the RMZ REIT indices produced in cumulative total return over that period. Over that same period since our IPO, VICI produced for its shareholders cumulative total return of 109.7%. I'll repeat that, 109.7%. This cumulative total return by VICI beat the S&P by more than 2x and beat the REIT index by nearly 4x. Over that 5-year period, no other REIT in the S&P 500 produced cumulative total return superior to VICI, zip, zero, none. Since 2018, VICI has produced an AFFO per share compound annual growth of 7.7% and a quarterly dividend per share CAGR of 7.9%. If we look at 2022 by itself, we see another year in which VICI produced significant outperformance. VICI was the only S&P 500 REIT that produced positive total return in 2022. And VICI's 2022 13% total return generated 31.1 points of outperformance versus the S&P 500 index overall and 37.5 points of outperformance versus the RMZ REIT index. Our stockholders have received the outperformance they've deserved over the last 5 years and in 2022, given the support they have been given VICI throughout our 5-year history of portfolio growth and balance sheet upgrading. What we're most excited about is the opportunity to continue to create value for our stockholders. In a moment, David Kieske will lay out for you our 2023 AFFO guidance. I don't want to steal all of David's thunder, but once David has shared that guidance with you, I encourage you to compare VICI's 2023 guidance to consensus 2023 S&P 500 earnings forecast which are generally trending between very low single digits and negative single digits. Compare VICI\u2019s 2023 guidance to what you are hearing from other REITs, especially other S&P 500 REITs, which is generally 2023 AFFO growth guidance in the low single digits. And once you have made that earnings growth comparison, I encourage you to make a comparison between VICI\u2019s multiple on 2023 AFFO and the 2023 AFFO multiples of other S&P 500 REITs. Once you've made those comparisons, I believe you'll find that VICI offers what we believe to be one of the more compelling 2023 price earnings growth or PEG plus yield ratios that you will find among all S&P 500 REITs. To help you along in that calculation, I'll give you this starting point. The AFFO growth represented by the midpoint of our guidance, plus our dividend yield as of yesterday, equals 14.5%. Compare that 14.5% figure to what other S&P 500 REITs are offering in 2023 AFFO growth, rates plus dividend yields, and I believe you will see VICI standing out. Finally, I'll give you one more comparison. With consensus estimates of S&P 500 2023 earnings per share growth running at 1% and the current S&P 500 dividend yield running around 1.6%, the combination of current estimated earnings growth and dividend yield would be 2.6% for the S&P 500. The combination of VICI's midpoint AFFO growth and our current dividend yield would be over 14%.  With that, I'll turn it over to John for his remarks. John?\nJohn Payne : Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 5 years, our team has worked relentlessly to institutionalize our asset class and to deliver value for our shareholders by growing our portfolio accretively. During this time period, we've expanded our roster of tenants from just one at formation to 11 best-in-class operators who manage some of the most complex and profitable experiential assets across the globe.  Our hard work has also resulted in growing our portfolio from 19 properties at formation to 49 assets today with our portfolio encompassing, what we believe, are some of the most iconic properties across all commercial real estate classes, and our real estate now crosses into international territory. Now none of this would have been possible without the effort of our dedicated team who on many occasions end up working nights, weekends and unfortunately, holidays. For that, we, as an executive management team are very, very grateful. In some ways, 2022 was the hallmark of our achievements. Early in the year, we completed the acquisition of Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, arguably one of the most iconic experiential assets in the world at a very attractive 6.25% cap rate. Those of you who have followed our story may remember that the Venetian was announced during the very unique time period. While decision to acquire that asset may appear simple today, the transaction came together in early 2021 when many believe the recovery of Las Vegas was uncertain. During our underwriting period, we allocated resources towards studying the market and performing in-depth due diligence. Throughout that process, we grew increasingly confident in our underwriting and ultimately confirmed our very bullish bet on the Las Vegas market. As we sit here today, we continue to see that the Las Vegas market is producing record results. Leisure business remains robust, meetings and conventions have returned and consumers continue to visit the city in record number. In essence, we believe consumers did not find a replacement for the experience offered by the Las Vegas market, nor do we believe they ever will. The Las Vegas economy continues to diversify catering to a broad array of consumer preferences, and the city continues to leverage vast infrastructure by hosting unique events and events of scale. We remain firm believers in the Las Vegas market and will continue to be vocal about our belief in the outlook for the city. Following our completion of the Venetian transaction, just a few months later, we completed the strategic acquisition of MGM Growth Properties, adding 15 exceptional assets to our portfolio and beginning a former relationship with MGM Resorts. These two transactions alone deliver growth that would satisfy many companies. However, as the year carried on, we supplemented those achievements with the pending acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino in Maryland and investment in our Property Growth Fund, the acquisition of Blackstone's interest in the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay joint venture, which we closed in January. We closed on the acquisition of two additional regional gaming assets with Foundation Gaming. And we invested in the Fontainebleau Las Vegas alongside the renowned Koch Industries. In addition to our achievements in gaming, we deepened our relationship with Great Wolf Resorts, during the year by financing certain growth projects and we announced partnerships with Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch, widening our university of growth opportunities for years to come. Last but surely not least, as the calendar turned to 2023, we announced our first international investment by closing on the acquisition of 4 casino properties in Alberta, Canada. We have talked about expanding our portfolio internationally on many of these earnings calls before and are thrilled to demonstrate once again that we do what we say. As we look ahead to 2023, we will be planting the seeds of growth for the next 5 years and beyond. First and foremost, we are going to continue establishing relationships that yield mutually beneficial outcomes. And as always, we intend to focus on opportunities that deliver accretive growth for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet, our financial results and our guidance. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2022 demonstrated the continued discipline we have maintained over our 5-plus years of existence by ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. This focus provided VICI with continued access to the capital markets throughout 2022 to support our growth and just to recap a few highlights from the year. In April, we achieved our goal of an investment-grade credit rating as both S&P and Fitch rated VICI BBB- allowing us to raise $5 billion of investment-grade debt across a series of three, five, seven, 10 and 30-year tenures to fund the acquisition of MGP. VICI's ability to access the 30-year tenure was a first for a first-time investment-grade REIT issuer, and we are thankful for the support we received from our credit partners in this transaction. In June, we were added to the S&P 500 Index, marking the fastest time line a REIT has been added to the index from IPO to inclusion, deepening our access to equity capital. In November, we raised $575.6 million of net equity proceeds through a 19 million share forward sale agreement. We utilized the ATM throughout the year, raising equity very efficiently for a total of $696.6 million in net proceeds through the sale of 21.6 million shares via forward sale agreements. Those amounts include $208.3 million through the sale of 6.3 million shares via forward sale agreements that occurred in Q4. Then subsequent to year-end, in January, we raised $965 million of net equity proceeds through a 30.3 million share forward sale agreement, which remains unsettled today and available to fund future transactions. Currently, we have approximately $3.8 billion in total liquidity comprised of $426 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022. We have the $965 million of net proceeds from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. As a reminder, in January, we drew down CAD 140 million or approximately USD 103 million under our revolver in connection with our PURE Canadian gaming acquisition. We will look to term out this revolver draw in the future.  In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of CMBS debt that encumbers the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of activity from our recent acquisitions is approximately 5.7x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.7 years to maturity.  Turning to the income statement. Total GAAP revenues increased 100.9% year-over-year to $769.9 million in Q4 as a result of the transformative 2022 acquisition activity John mentioned. AFFO for the fourth quarter was approximately $488 million or $0.51 per share. Total AFFO in Q4 increased approximately 75% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 15.5% over the prior year. Just as a reminder, the disparity between overall AFFO growth and the AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raise and shares issued to consummate our acquisition of MGP during Q2 and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort during Q1 of last year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2%, one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.  Turning to guidance. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO at year ending December 31, 2023 is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 per share and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance reflects the full year of 2022 closed acquisitions as well as the acquisitions we completed in January, the PURE Canadian Gaming acquisition and the acquisition of Blackstone's 49.9% stake in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Additionally, the per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 30.3 million forward shares sold in January of this year. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. And as we have discussed with you in the past, we recorded a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone : First question is for David, I guess. In the past, you guys have been really good at matching your investments with the debt and equity needed to complete them. As you kind of think about '23 and looking forward, just what's the appetite to either reduce leverage or look out further on the horizon and address future maturities just to give yourself room as you think about what you may buy next.\nDavid Kieske : Yes. Great to talk to, Tony. Just to level set, our first maturity or next maturity comes due in May 1, 2024, for the $1.50 billion of 5.625 notes that come due. So we have no maturities due in 2023. And I think we'll continue to focus on bringing the leverage back down to 5x and 5.5x. And just to remind everybody, when we consummated the MGP acquisition we worked with the agencies and help them understand the merits of the deal, and they were thrilled with the transaction, given the diversity and allowing us to take leverage up just north of our 5 and 5.5 guidepost.  And so as you saw us do at the end of last year and with the significant free cash flow we have in the business, we'll over-equitize some of the smaller acquisitions, use free cash flow to fund some of the smaller acquisitions and the loan fundings that we have. And then as we navigate potentially larger transactions, we look to match fund that as efficiently as possible. But again, with the goal of bringing leverage over time back down to 5x to 5.5x.\nAnthony Paolone : Okay. And then just a follow-up. As you speak with tenants and think about things like Property Growth Fund and more capital being invested in the assets, any change in the dialogue, either tapping the brakes because of the economic uncertainty or capital markets? Or just generally, what are those conversations like today? And have they changed?\nEdward Pitoniak : John?\nJohn Payne : Hey, Tony, good to talk to you this morning. We're fortunate to have tenants right now that are doing extremely well. I think those on the phone who follow the gaming industry are watching the results coming out of Las Vegas, in particular, or if they're not all-time records, they're close to all-time records. So we continue to be thoughtful in our conversations with our tenants, and they continue to look longer term about how they grow their business, and we're there to have those conversations and hopefully be part of their growth plans with, as you mentioned, our Property Growth Fund.\nOperator: We now turn to Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa : Maybe sort of following up on the line of question as Tony had. I'm just curious, Ed, and John, like how are you thinking about the world today maybe versus six to nine months ago? And just how are you thinking about underwriting changes and potential issues down the road. Has that sort of colored your view on kind of yield expectations or how you think about coverage ratios or business lines that you may want to go into?\nEdward Pitoniak : It definitely has, Steve, and good to talk to you. The lack of visibility right now almost equals opacity. And you just need a week like this one in the markets to be reminded, in case you need a reminder as to how uncertain things are. So as John spoke of, we really have so much confidence right now in our operators, and we believe our gaming operators are going to continue to do very well for a host of reasons, particularly having to do with the demand drivers that Vegas enjoys for at least the next couple of years. But when it comes to the access to and cost of capital, we have to be as silver as everyone else has to be about the fact that obviously, credit conditions have tightened, we have definitely benefited from a cost advantage on cost of equity given how well we performed. But we certainly need to be careful about underwriting yields that probably do need to be higher than they've been over the last couple of years. And we also have to be very mindful if we're in consumer discretionary, which we are as to what a tenant's performance might be under different operating scenarios, should we see soft lending, hard landing, prolonged soft, prolonged hard landing. We also have -- need to be mindful of inflation. But we obviously do enjoy versus many of our REIT peers, certainly net lease REIT peers, the advantage of some CPI protections that definitely benefit our investors this year in 2023.\nSteve Sakwa : Okay. And then maybe circling back on the international deal in Canada. I'm just curious as you kind of look at the landscape and you sort of just look at the opportunities out there. I guess, are you seeing more opportunities internationally today? Or do you see more -- I assume the U.S. market is a bigger market, but if you kind of size it, do you see better opportunities outside the U.S. today or inside?\nEdward Pitoniak : I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Steve. But the way we think about growth is we think about growing both categorically and geographically, -- and so as you watch us, as you actually see what we did last year and as you look at us going forward, we will always be looking for great opportunities to grow into new categories as we did last year with Cabot and Canyon Ranch. And we look to grow in new geographies as we do with Canada. But I'll turn it over to John for his thoughts on how to how to think about the way we look at the U.S. versus international. John?\nJohn Payne : Yes, Steve, good to talk to you this morning. I'd say a little bit is we've gotten more mature as a company, and we talked to you all before about adding resources to our organizations, which then allows us to go out around the world and look at opportunities. I wouldn't say there's better opportunities internationally than domestically. I'd simply say we're able to learn more about different countries and the opportunities that are out there right now. As Ed started out this answering this question, we're being very thoughtful in anything we do right now in our underwriting. But again, we've got resources now that allow us to go and look all over the world for opportunities, not only in gaming, but in certain experiential sectors that we really like.\nSteve Sakwa : Okay. Just a quick follow-up, and then I'll yield the floor. Just is there a yield differential when you sort of think about international and currency risk against the U.S.\nDavid Kieske : Yes, Steve, that end of your question has the key, right? What's the currency risk and what's the tax leakage and then underwriting a yield that makes sense to take that into account. And we did that with the PURE Canadian transaction. And as John mentioned, we're learning about other parts of the globe and where our capital can make sense. I mean it's and then where we can efficiently structure transactions that work for both sides.\nOperator: We'll now turn to Smedes Rose from Citi.\nSmedes Rose : There was an activist proposal earlier around Six Flags that brought you guys in the mix. And I know you're probably not going to comment on that deal specifically at that proposal. But I'm just interested would you be interested in sort of theoretically big picture in that kind of owning theme park land or real estate? And how would you think about underwriting that versus maybe some of the other asset classes you're in?\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. So you're right, Smedes, we won't comment on any specific situations. But we have talked in the past on our earnings call and in our investor engagements about our interest in the theme park space. We think it has an awful lot of attributes to remind us in very good ways of our gaming investments. These are very complex assets. They're very large-scale assets. They're very capital-intensive assets. They have proven themselves over decades. What we also find interesting about the theme park landscape in the U.S. is it is really an un-networked landscape. You have hubs, obviously, in the form of Anaheim and Orlando, and you have spokes in terms of the regional theme park operators, but they're not connected and that kind of puzzles us and can't help thinking, well, geez, what would the power be if you could ever connect these things? And we'll see if anything ever comes to that. But yes, it is a category and experiential category that we believe has real investment merits for us, both strategically and economically.\nSmedes Rose : And then I was just wondering, John, I mean, it sounds like obviously, Vegas is all go, go go, but I mean are you hearing maybe just a little more specifics around sort of regular sort of leisure visitation versus return of corporate groups or any kind of thing you're hearing on your tenants kind of on the different drivers of business?\nJohn Payne : Smedes, nice to talk to you this morning. I just spent time with all our Las Vegas operators over the past couple of weeks. And as you started out by saying the business continues to be very strong, robust. And the beauty of Las Vegas is that they're seeing growth and demand from all those different segments. That's what makes Las Vegas so special that they get the international gamer. They get the domestic gamer. They have the meeting business that's coming back. They have [FIT] business. And the operators there continue to add resources and add assets to their facilities. We just can't say enough about our tenants that are there and the performance that they're having, and they see -- they do not see a slowdown in their business. And then later this year, they're probably at one of the biggest weeks and weekends that they've ever had with Formula One coming and then they're going to turn the year in '24 and go right into the Super Bowl. So it's a city like no other, we talk internally is there a city performing better than Las Vegas in the world, and we're not sure we can find one. And all the credit goes to our tenants and the way they are marketing that city and their properties\nOperator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.\nBarry Jonas: I wanted to keep on the Vegas theme and maybe start with Fontainebleau. Can you talk about sort of your expectations for what this relationship could develop into down the road? Have they given any intentions around sale leaseback at some point? And then how should we be modeling timing of the full loan?\nDavid Kieske : Yes. Barry, I can start, and John chime in with anything I missed. But look, we went in -- we've looked at this asset over a period of a number of years, and I think it's a phenomenal asset and even better backed by the equity support of the Koch Industries. And then the Soffer organization, we\u2019ll have the vision and get it open towards the end of this year. So there's nothing formal in terms of our relationship in terms of a path to real estate ownership. But when you act as good partners, and you'll help support other partners' objectives. That leads to more opportunities and just the size and scale of industries and everything that they have and the size of their real estate book, especially focused in leisure and hospitality, we think there could be more things to come in the future, and we're excited to partner with them and be involved with that project.\nBarry Jonas : Okay. Great. And then just -- maybe just spending a minute on Hard Rock and Mirage. What are the next steps there for potential redevelopment and also the Partner Property Growth Fund loan -- potential loan there? Is there a general time line for specifics to be worked out here?\nEdward Pitoniak : John?\nJohn Payne : Barry, it's John. Yes. Very good to talk to you this morning. really more a question for our tenant on that. But Jim Allen and the Hard Rock team just took the business over earlier this year. They're getting used to the property, understand their property, understanding demand, understanding how busy Las Vegas is right now, which is great. And the last communication is they're studying their plan, working through this year, and we'll be in contact with them over the next coming months, and we'll have a better idea of what the ultimate timing and what their ultimate plans will be. So nothing new than last time we talked about this.\nOperator: We now turn to Wesley Golladay from Baird.\nWesley Golladay : I just have a quick follow-up to the last question. I wonder you set the rates for these projects such as the Mirage or the Hard Rock?\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes, Wes, thanks for the question. David is best equipped to answer this. And I don't think David heard it quite clearly.\nDavid Kieske : Wes, I think I caught it, you say when we set the rates for these Partner Property Growth Funds. Is that -- did I get that right?\nWesley Golladay: Yes. I mean we currently model say, around 8% or so, but I don't know if those are set at the time you mentioned the deal, at the time of the closing of the transaction, and there's always a future opportunity. But I don't know these rates are already locked in and when they can plan the project around a certain yield. Or do you get the scope of the project and then you set the terms?\nDavid Kieske : Yes. The rates are not locked in, Wes, so it's part of the negotiation. When we obviously announced Hard Rock's acquisition of the Mirage, we said we'd be happy to commit up to $1.5 billion of our Partner Property Growth Fund or even more if they needed it, but that would all be subject to negotiation in terms of final terms, rate, structure, timing.\nEdward Pitoniak : And related to that, Wes.\nWesley Golladay : For the consolidation of the joint venture\u2026\nEdward Pitoniak : Go ahead. Go ahead, Wes.\nWesley Golladay : No, no. Go ahead, go ahead.\nEdward Pitoniak : I was just going to say, needless to say, the pricing of capital right now is an exercise that is not easy to carry out. Obviously, having a forward view of the cost of capital in the future and then pricing our capital to a borrower or a partner. It's not an easy exercise. And go ahead, Wes.\nWesley Golladay : My last follow-up would be the, for the consolidation of the joint venture for the Blackstone deal that you did earlier in the year, how are you going to handle the debt for that? Would it be a mark-to-market for just the JV portion or the whole portion and any sense of the magnitude?\nEdward Pitoniak : Gabe?\nGabriel Wasserman : Yes. It's Gabe here. So I think we have some flexibility where we can either inherit our partner's existing basis on the debt or we can roll over that basis or we can choose to market to market. So still having that debate internally, and we'll start focusing on that in the month ahead.\nOperator: We'll turn to John DeCree from CBRE Securities.\nJohn DeCree : Maybe one big picture question, Ed, to push you on the spot a little bit. You gave a nice recap of VICI's first 5 years quite successfully in your prepared remarks. Wondering if you'd kind of venture a prediction or a plan kind of for the next 5 years?\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. David just covered the ears of Samantha Gallagher, RGC. Yes, John. Well, we -- okay, so to be really forthright, if 5 years ago, if you had said, okay, I want your prediction for the next 5 years ahead, I would not have predicted what we had done. We always had a conviction that we had a wonderful opportunity to institutionalize the real estate asset class that had not really yet been institutionalized. And we think so much of the story of this first 5 years, so much of our outperformance, 2x the S&P 500, 2x the NASDAQ. I probably should have mentioned that as well as hot as the NASDAQ was during much of that period, crazily hot at times. The NASDAQ performance over that 5 years was dead on the S&P 500 performance, and we beat them both by 2x, right? So as we look ahead, we certainly cannot base our strategy on continuing that kind of outperformance because to base our strategy on that kind of outperformance might involve -- would likely involve taking risk, so we're not sure we should take in terms of creating and sustaining value for our investors. So what you'll see us do over the next 5 years is continue to grow categorically, continue to grow geographically, do accretive deals be willing to over-equitize in the way David spoke of at the beginning and answering Tony's question and just make sure that we never put the value we've created together with our investors at risk. One of the great benefits. Or I shouldn't say one of the great benefits. One of the great drivers of our outperformance over the first 5 years is we never went backward for sustained periods. We obviously had volatility as everybody else did over that 5 years. We never went backward and stayed there for a long time. And we don't want to start doing that in the next 5 years. So I think you'll see us be disciplined in how we allocate capital. And in order to do that, we'll be disciplined in how we underwrite. And always look to learn from REITs who have succeeded in doing what we want to attempt to do. So whether it's a Prologis in terms of how they've grown internationally, whether it's great ideas and how you grow categorically. Like full marks to Sumit and the Realty Income team for the deal they announced this week on Plenty. Like that kind of deal making on the part of our peers really inspires us because it is evidence of how to think creatively and innovatively in developing into new categories. So I think that's what you can expect of us over the next 5 years, John.\nJohn DeCree : Makes sense. It's great insight on a curve ball there. Maybe a softer one as a follow-up. Last couple acquisitions you've made and maybe for John or kind of from maybe lesser known tenants, a little bit smaller companies. How do you think about kind of underwriting standards different from your large public tenants relative to smaller private companies? And then is that a trend you've kind of seen emerging more this year, a little bit more activity with smaller, maybe private companies? Or would you expect to see similar kind of deal flow from the larger public cos, realizing they probably have a bit more to do. But curious how you're thinking about those kind of two different types of tenants?\nJohn Payne : Yes, John, a very good question. But it's not new to VICI, right? I mean part of what we're proud of is that we've taken the time to go talk to all the operators inside the gaming industry and hopefully, over the next 5 years and most of the experiential companies whether you're big, whether you're small, whether you're private, whether you're public, we take the time to understand how they're trying to grow their company. And is there a possibility for us in our form of capital to help them grow. And so that won't change as Ed just went through the next 5 years and what won't change. I think that's this curiosity that we have as a business development team to get to know it may be a small company, and it may be a small deal, but we're hoping that over the course of our time together with them, we take a small deal and we make it bigger, we help a small company become larger. And you're going to continue to see that. You've seen it since we started the company, and I think you'll continue to see us do deals with smaller private companies. And I believe you'll see us continue to do deals with large public companies, and that will allow us to continue to grow our business as we expect.\nOperator: We'll now turn to Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem : Great. Just maybe a couple of quick ones from me. The first is just on the AFFO growth, almost 10%, which is pretty impressive compared to some of the other triple-net peers in the sort of flat to 3% range. I was just wondering if we could sort of get a breakout of organic versus external growth of that number. So how much of that is being driven by sort of the inflation escalators versus some of the acquisitions that were done in '22?\nDavid Kieske : Ron, it's David. Nice to talk here. It's all driven by -- well, said differently the way, we modeled the escalator in November with Caesars is 2%. We do not make any predictions about the future. My counsel next to me would be very upset. And then -- so the acquisitions, as I mentioned in my remarks, are all baked in, including the PURE deal, which closed in early January as well as the reconsolidation in early January as well. And then it does not include Rocky Gap, which is still outstanding.\nEdward Pitoniak : But -- and Ron, if I understand your question right, there is no question that the rent escalation that kicked in, in November for Caesars, and I believe it's January for Century definitely plays a role in generating that 10% AFFO growth. But to David's point, we obviously have -- toward the end of this year, we've only underwritten base level rent growth. We do not presume any kind of -- we do not make any CPI assumptions for forward rent, if that's of any help. And we don't include any unclosed acquisitions, just to be clear or on loans that do not have fixed draw schedules yet.\nRonald Kamdem : Great. That's helpful and clear. I can move on to sort of the pipeline. I think in past call, we've talked about sort of sizing the market, which we've sort of all have done. But I'm curious if you guys have any sort of quantifiable numbers on pipeline, the amount of deals that you're in talk with, if it's $10 billion, if it's $50 billion, whatever, I think that would be sort of a helpful information? \nEdward Pitoniak : John, you want to start?\nJohn Payne : Yes, I don't have a specific number on that right now. I would tell you as I talked earlier in this call about adding resources to our organization, to our business development team. So what I would tell you is that we're active or more active in deal flow than we ever have done before. It's obviously an uncertain time. We have to be incredibly thoughtful in any type of deal that we do in the underwriting that we do. But we've been able to expand not only in gaming, and you heard me talk about public companies and private companies. But in many of the sectors that we've talked in previous calls about. So we're touching more companies, we're meeting more companies than we ever have done before. We're explaining how our capital ultimately can help those companies grow. But I don't have the exact size for you. I don't know if Danny is on the call and wanted to add anything to my answer.\nDaniel Valoy: John, I think you covered it well. I mean we've talked about some of the opportunities that we look at within gaming and that ranging from anywhere from $40 billion to $50 billion of potential transactions. That's not an all-encompassing blue sky numbers. Those are opportunities that we think are actionable at some point in time. But as we've talked about a lot here, the universe of opportunities is growing, especially as we look internationally, as we continue to study and explore other experiential sectors. So it's difficult to give you a single number right now, Ron.\nEdward Pitoniak : I would just add a little bit more to that, Ron. The last time we saw that the American commercial, I want to emphasize, commercial gaming sector was about 40% REITed that would contrast, say, with the mall space, which I believe is 70% plus REITed. The other thing to keep in mind is that we do have an American tribal gaming sector that is equal in size to American regional gaming. And we are now three or four tribal relationships, John and Danny. And that is a sector where those -- that sector is led by operators. We're very eager to do more business with in all the ways we can possibly think of. The thing I'll finally add is that there are obviously new jurisdictions opening up to gaming. And we just saw a headline this morning about Governor Abbott of Texas saying, if we're going to get gaming in Texas, I want it to be -- how did he put it, John? Great Wolf Lodge type of gaming. I can't remember exactly how -- yes. And we read that headline, we go that\u2019s great because we're already in business with Great Wolf, and we definitely are in business in gaming. So you look at a market like Texas and needless to say, we get quite excited given the capital allocation opportunities, a market like that could represent\nOperator: We'll now turn to David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz : You've covered an awful lot of detail and we don't need to sort of double back over those. But what I wanted to just throw out there is a question that's come up with investors in my travels, which is the next couple of years, we spend time thinking about potential capital raising and more so equity than debt for obvious reasons on our side. Can you just talk through what you have in front of you? And obviously, the Caesars pipeline as well? And what the prospects for you could be or having to go out and raise some more equity and under what circumstances you might do that?\nEdward Pitoniak : Well, as a starting point, David, and I'll turn this over to John in just a moment. As a starting point as a REIT, you can be confident we will perpetually raising equity. But we will be perpetually raising equity for years to come as all good growing REITs do to fund accretive growth that benefits all shareholders. And that's been our track record to date. It's evidenced by the kind of AFFO growth per share we're producing in 2023 and have on a compounded basis since our beginning in 2018. But again, so we will raise equity when the opportunities are there to do so. And we will raise equity to fund accretive acquisitions. In terms of the pipeline, I'll turn it over to John because we obviously have opportunities like the Indiana assets in our future. John?\nJohn Payne : Yes, David, good to talk to you this morning. And as Ed alluded to, in our view is the opportunity with Caesars to our put/call opportunity with two Indianapolis assets that are performing incredibly well. That put/call is kind of live right now, and we'll see how that ultimately plays out. But that is a really nice opportunity that we hope we can bring into our portfolio in the coming years. And then obviously, I've spent a lot of time on this call already talking about the numerous relationships that we're building in gaming and in non-gaming. And I hope part of our growth will be with our existing tenants, whether that's an opportunity as they grow into new jurisdictions like New York or as Ed mentioned, maybe Texas will break at some point. And I hope it's also growth with new tenants as well.\nEdward Pitoniak : Hey, David, if I could just add one more thought...\nDavid Katz : Please.\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. David, if I could add one more thought in relation to this, and it's something we haven't talked about on this call. But when it comes to being a growth-oriented REIT and when it comes to being a REIT, that will likely continue to access the capital markets, there is really no question in our minds and don't think there should be any question in anybody's mind as to the advantages of scale when it comes to access to the capital markets. And I think what you could see over the next few years is an increasing bifurcation or a barbell effect emerging across the American REIT landscape, where great advantages accrue to the biggest REIT with the most compelling value-creation stories because their access to capital in large volumes will be highly superior. You'll always have the small REITs that can produce significant growth in their early years. But the problem is you can reach a no-man's land of what we'll call mid-cap REITs, where it's really -- it's tough to access capital and high volumes and it gets a little bit tougher to produce material growth year-over-year-over-year. And we think at the scale we're at now, as I believe, the ninth largest REIT in the RMZ, it definitely brings advantages when it comes to access to and cost of capital. And sorry, I'll turn it back to you for your next question, David.\nDavid Katz : Appreciate that. With respect to the Native American part, I know we've talked about this before, but building those relationships in a way where you can own hard assets? Or is it more building relationships by providing loans on reservation land that will enable you to sort of own real estate in other areas? Or are you trying to solve the code for reservation land?\nEdward Pitoniak : We definitely worked on that, and we think there could be solutions down the road. In the near term, and I'll turn it over to John, our greatest excitement is helping them grow either off of tribal land or adjacent to tribal land. John?\nJohn Payne : Right. That's exactly right, David. I mean, we continue just as we're building relationship with commercial operators we're getting out and meeting with many native American nations just to let them understand who we are, how we could help them grow in the commercial opportunities when if that's what their mission is to. So I'm spending a lot of time on the road doing that and letting them understand VICI and we already have partners with three native-American nations\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc.\nTodd Thomas: I just wanted to go back to your interest in nongaming and following up on your comments about sensitizing underlying businesses and operators in various economic scenarios. Has your appetite changed around nongaming assets today just given the more uncertain macro and maybe sort of consumer backdrop? Or does it just require additional coverage and return?\nEdward Pitoniak : I would say, Todd, that our interest in nongaming hasn't diminished at all even amidst this lack of visibility around the consumer economy because of our strong conviction around the secular tailwinds of experiential businesses. We have seen with COVID, finally, starting to leave the landscape that what had been in place for the prior 10 years or so, 15 years prior to COVID, which was the increasing consumer preference for experiences over things, has definitely reasserted itself. And we don't think that, that's going to diminish. We think the aging of the baby boom into their prime leisure years, we think millennial family formation. Those are demographic waves, together with this increasing preference for experiences over things, is going to give experiential operators across a number of spectra really compelling growth opportunities and very strong economic performance, almost no matter what cyclicality looks like.\nTodd Thomas : Okay. And have you -- how have you increased your required returns as you think about underwriting investments going forward? I mean can you sort of quantify what you're seeing, what you're underwriting and also whether sellers are adjusting their expectations today?\nDavid Kieske : Todd, it's David. Good to talk to you. I mean as a net lease REIT, obviously, we're a spread investor, and we have to ensure that we receive an appropriate spread for the risk of the investment and to factor the location and the asset, the tenant, the business and taking that all into account in our underwriting. And the last part of your question there is spot on, right? And you've heard this from other net lease REITs, right? There's still a bid-ask spread for a lot of folks in terms of what they think the asset is worth and what we can actually acquire that with an appropriate rent coverage and generate an attractive return -- attractive risk-adjusted returns. So I would tell you we're being more diligent in terms of underwriting the business, the proof of concept, the longevity of concept, everything that we've talked about since day one of this company. Is there an enduring experience the consumers are going to go to over time. And so we're spending more time and going deeper on some certain sectors where we think there's some opportunities and larger growth opportunities going forward in those sectors.\nTodd Thomas : Okay. Do you -- when you look out over -- during the course of the year ahead here, do you expect the spread at which you're investing relative to your cost of capital? Do you expect that to be wider than it was in '22?\nDavid Kieske : So we expect that to be wide. I mean we always want to generate 100 basis points to 150 basis points spread to our cost of capital. It's kind of what we set as a preliminary benchmark, now that can be higher at times or it can be lower at times depending on the quality of the asset, the operator or a riskier asset and riskier operator or locations in the country.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Kornreich from SMBC.\nJay Kornreich : I guess I just want to start with a follow-up on the Fontainebleau Las Vegas that will be a great asset. And I guess providing construction loans is a riskier and higher return investment option that you had typically endeavor in. So just I'm curious if you saw this as more of a one-off opportunity? Or if you see providing casino and hotel construction loans as more of a path towards growth in the future?\nDavid Kieske : Yes, Jay, it's David. I mean with our capital, we always want to find what makes sense at the right point in time with ideally a path to real estate ownership. And as I mentioned earlier, we do not have a direct path to real estate ownership with the Fontainebleau, but we developed a phenomenal relationship with Koch and Soffer that could lead to other opportunities. But as we've talked about with our Partner Property Growth Funds with other -- we talked with other gaming operators and non-gaming operators above ground-up development. We are doing that with Canyon Ranch. We're doing that with -- in a forum with Cabot in the golf opportunities. So the nice thing about our capital, it is flexible. It can come into different parts of the capital stack, so to speak. But again, ideally, we have a path to real estate ownership over the long term where we can continue to generate the types of returns and growth that we've done in our first 5 years.\nJay Kornreich : All right. And then I guess just on the non-gaming side with some of those partners that you just mentioned, that are quickly growing and they're looking for capital kind of fund that expansion. Do you have a sense of just how large that potential pipeline is in the U.S. for these types of quickly expanding non-gaming the platforms that you feel comfortable investing in?\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes, it category by category, Jay -- and Elliot, this is just a heads up. This will have to be the last question. These categories, there are so many of them and so many of them run into the many, many tens of millions of dollars of growth opportunities, some larger, some smaller. But it is a landscape -- an experiential landscape that we feel represents decades of growth ahead for VICI.\nEdward Pitoniak : And Jay, thank you for that question, Elliot. I think we will close things out now. And I'll just -- for those of you who haven't heard enough about VICI today, as just flash across the screen on CNBC, I will on Mad Money in the night, in case you haven't heard enough. And with that, thank you all for your time today and really appreciate your attention to VICI and we're very excited about the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us. That's it for now. Thank you.\nOperator: This call is now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I mean we've talked about some of the opportunities that we look at within gaming and that ranging from anywhere from $40 billion to $50 billion of potential transactions. That's not an all-encompassing blue sky numbers. Those are opportunities that we think are actionable at some point in time. But as we've talked about a lot here, the universe of opportunities is growing, especially as we look internationally, as we continue to study and explore other experiential sectors.

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 5 years, our team has worked relentlessly to institutionalize our asset class and to deliver value for our shareholders by growing our portfolio accretively. During this time period, we've expanded our roster of tenants from just one at formation to 11 best-in-class operators who manage some of the most complex and profitable experiential assets across the globe.  Our hard work has also resulted in growing our portfolio from 19 properties at formation to 49 assets today with our portfolio encompassing, what we believe, are some of the most iconic properties across all commercial real estate classes, and our real estate now crosses into international territory. Now none of this would have been possible without the effort of our dedicated team who on many occasions end up working nights, weekends and unfortunately, holidays. For that, we, as an executive management team are very, very grateful. In some ways, 2022 was the hallmark of our achievements. Early in the year, we completed the acquisition of Venetian Resort in Las Vegas, arguably one of the most iconic experiential assets in the world at a very attractive 6.25% cap rate. Those of you who have followed our story may remember that the Venetian was announced during the very unique time period. While decision to acquire that asset may appear simple today, the transaction came together in early 2021 when many believe the recovery of Las Vegas was uncertain. During our underwriting period, we allocated resources towards studying the market and performing in-depth due diligence. Throughout that process, we grew increasingly confident in our underwriting and ultimately confirmed our very bullish bet on the Las Vegas market. As we sit here today, we continue to see that the Las Vegas market is producing record results. Leisure business remains robust, meetings and conventions have returned and consumers continue to visit the city in record number. In essence, we believe consumers did not find a replacement for the experience offered by the Las Vegas market, nor do we believe they ever will. The Las Vegas economy continues to diversify catering to a broad array of consumer preferences, and the city continues to leverage vast infrastructure by hosting unique events and events of scale. We remain firm believers in the Las Vegas market and will continue to be vocal about our belief in the outlook for the city. Following our completion of the Venetian transaction, just a few months later, we completed the strategic acquisition of MGM Growth Properties, adding 15 exceptional assets to our portfolio and beginning a former relationship with MGM Resorts. These two transactions alone deliver growth that would satisfy many companies. However, as the year carried on, we supplemented those achievements with the pending acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino in Maryland and investment in our Property Growth Fund, the acquisition of Blackstone's interest in the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay joint venture, which we closed in January. We closed on the acquisition of two additional regional gaming assets with Foundation Gaming. And we invested in the Fontainebleau Las Vegas alongside the renowned Koch Industries. In addition to our achievements in gaming, we deepened our relationship with Great Wolf Resorts, during the year by financing certain growth projects and we announced partnerships with Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch, widening our university of growth opportunities for years to come. Last but surely not least, as the calendar turned to 2023, we announced our first international investment by closing on the acquisition of 4 casino properties in Alberta, Canada. We have talked about expanding our portfolio internationally on many of these earnings calls before and are thrilled to demonstrate once again that we do what we say. As we look ahead to 2023, we will be planting the seeds of growth for the next 5 years and beyond. First and foremost, we are going to continue establishing relationships that yield mutually beneficial outcomes. And as always, we intend to focus on opportunities that deliver accretive growth for our shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our balance sheet, our financial results and our guidance. David? Hey, Tony, good to talk to you this morning. We're fortunate to have tenants right now that are doing extremely well. I think those on the phone who follow the gaming industry are watching the results coming out of Las Vegas, in particular, or if they're not all-time records, they're close to all-time records. So we continue to be thoughtful in our conversations with our tenants, and they continue to look longer term about how they grow their business, and we're there to have those conversations and hopefully be part of their growth plans with, as you mentioned, our Property Growth Fund. Yes, Steve, good to talk to you this morning. I'd say a little bit is we've gotten more mature as a company, and we talked to you all before about adding resources to our organizations, which then allows us to go out around the world and look at opportunities. I wouldn't say there's better opportunities internationally than domestically. I'd simply say we're able to learn more about different countries and the opportunities that are out there right now. As Ed started out this answering this question, we're being very thoughtful in anything we do right now in our underwriting. But again, we've got resources now that allow us to go and look all over the world for opportunities, not only in gaming, but in certain experiential sectors that we really like. Smedes, nice to talk to you this morning. I just spent time with all our Las Vegas operators over the past couple of weeks. And as you started out by saying the business continues to be very strong, robust. And the beauty of Las Vegas is that they're seeing growth and demand from all those different segments. That's what makes Las Vegas so special that they get the international gamer. They get the domestic gamer. They have the meeting business that's coming back. They have [FIT] business. And the operators there continue to add resources and add assets to their facilities. We just can't say enough about our tenants that are there and the performance that they're having, and they see -- they do not see a slowdown in their business. And then later this year, they're probably at one of the biggest weeks and weekends that they've ever had with Formula One coming and then they're going to turn the year in '24 and go right into the Super Bowl. So it's a city like no other, we talk internally is there a city performing better than Las Vegas in the world, and we're not sure we can find one. And all the credit goes to our tenants and the way they are marketing that city and their properties Barry, it's John. Yes. Very good to talk to you this morning. really more a question for our tenant on that. But Jim Allen and the Hard Rock team just took the business over earlier this year. They're getting used to the property, understand their property, understanding demand, understanding how busy Las Vegas is right now, which is great. And the last communication is they're studying their plan, working through this year, and we'll be in contact with them over the next coming months, and we'll have a better idea of what the ultimate timing and what their ultimate plans will be. So nothing new than last time we talked about this. Yes, John, a very good question. But it's not new to VICI, right? I mean part of what we're proud of is that we've taken the time to go talk to all the operators inside the gaming industry and hopefully, over the next 5 years and most of the experiential companies whether you're big, whether you're small, whether you're private, whether you're public, we take the time to understand how they're trying to grow their company. And is there a possibility for us in our form of capital to help them grow. And so that won't change as Ed just went through the next 5 years and what won't change. I think that's this curiosity that we have as a business development team to get to know it may be a small company, and it may be a small deal, but we're hoping that over the course of our time together with them, we take a small deal and we make it bigger, we help a small company become larger. And you're going to continue to see that. You've seen it since we started the company, and I think you'll continue to see us do deals with smaller private companies. And I believe you'll see us continue to do deals with large public companies, and that will allow us to continue to grow our business as we expect. Yes, I don't have a specific number on that right now. I would tell you as I talked earlier in this call about adding resources to our organization, to our business development team. So what I would tell you is that we're active or more active in deal flow than we ever have done before. It's obviously an uncertain time. We have to be incredibly thoughtful in any type of deal that we do in the underwriting that we do. But we've been able to expand not only in gaming, and you heard me talk about public companies and private companies. But in many of the sectors that we've talked in previous calls about. So we're touching more companies, we're meeting more companies than we ever have done before. We're explaining how our capital ultimately can help those companies grow. But I don't have the exact size for you. I don't know if Danny is on the call and wanted to add anything to my answer. Yes, David, good to talk to you this morning. And as Ed alluded to, in our view is the opportunity with Caesars to our put/call opportunity with two Indianapolis assets that are performing incredibly well. That put/call is kind of live right now, and we'll see how that ultimately plays out. But that is a really nice opportunity that we hope we can bring into our portfolio in the coming years. And then obviously, I've spent a lot of time on this call already talking about the numerous relationships that we're building in gaming and in non-gaming. And I hope part of our growth will be with our existing tenants, whether that's an opportunity as they grow into new jurisdictions like New York or as Ed mentioned, maybe Texas will break at some point. And I hope it's also growth with new tenants as well. Right. That's exactly right, David. I mean, we continue just as we're building relationship with commercial operators we're getting out and meeting with many native American nations just to let them understand who we are, how we could help them grow in the commercial opportunities when if that's what their mission is to. So I'm spending a lot of time on the road doing that and letting them understand VICI and we already have partners with three native-American nations"

            "name": "Edward Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to talk to you this morning about our results in 2022 and our outlook for 2023. John will also give you color on our operating environment and business development activities. I'll start by talking about VICI's first 5 years. A couple of weeks ago, we reached the 5-year anniversary of VICI's IPO. I want to thank every single VICI team and Board member for the incredible work they've done over this 5-year period, enabling VICI, among other things, to become the first REIT to go from IPO to S&P 500 inclusion in under 5 years. And I want to thank all of our operating partners in and outside of gaming for the amazing work they do in making our buildings, places a great experiential and economic value. In February of 2018, the time of VICI's IPO, I don't think any of you would have been very excited if I told you that the ensuing 5-year period from VICI IPO through year-end 2022 would be a period in which the S&P 500 Index would generate cumulative total return over that period of 48.5% or that their RMZ REIT index would generate cumulative total return of 27.9%. I want to emphasize those are not annual total return figures. Those are cumulative over the entire period. And that's exactly what the S&P 500 and the RMZ REIT indices produced in cumulative total return over that period. Over that same period since our IPO, VICI produced for its shareholders cumulative total return of 109.7%. I'll repeat that, 109.7%. This cumulative total return by VICI beat the S&P by more than 2x and beat the REIT index by nearly 4x. Over that 5-year period, no other REIT in the S&P 500 produced cumulative total return superior to VICI, zip, zero, none. Since 2018, VICI has produced an AFFO per share compound annual growth of 7.7% and a quarterly dividend per share CAGR of 7.9%. If we look at 2022 by itself, we see another year in which VICI produced significant outperformance. VICI was the only S&P 500 REIT that produced positive total return in 2022. And VICI's 2022 13% total return generated 31.1 points of outperformance versus the S&P 500 index overall and 37.5 points of outperformance versus the RMZ REIT index. Our stockholders have received the outperformance they've deserved over the last 5 years and in 2022, given the support they have been given VICI throughout our 5-year history of portfolio growth and balance sheet upgrading. What we're most excited about is the opportunity to continue to create value for our stockholders. In a moment, David Kieske will lay out for you our 2023 AFFO guidance. I don't want to steal all of David's thunder, but once David has shared that guidance with you, I encourage you to compare VICI's 2023 guidance to consensus 2023 S&P 500 earnings forecast which are generally trending between very low single digits and negative single digits. Compare VICI's 2023 guidance to what you are hearing from other REITs, especially other S&P 500 REITs, which is generally 2023 AFFO growth guidance in the low single digits. And once you have made that earnings growth comparison, I encourage you to make a comparison between VICI's multiple on 2023 AFFO and the 2023 AFFO multiples of other S&P 500 REITs. Once you've made those comparisons, I believe you'll find that VICI offers what we believe to be one of the more compelling 2023 price earnings growth or PEG plus yield ratios that you will find among all S&P 500 REITs. To help you along in that calculation, I'll give you this starting point. The AFFO growth represented by the midpoint of our guidance, plus our dividend yield as of yesterday, equals 14.5%. Compare that 14.5% figure to what other S&P 500 REITs are offering in 2023 AFFO growth, rates plus dividend yields, and I believe you will see VICI standing out. Finally, I'll give you one more comparison. With consensus estimates of S&P 500 2023 earnings per share growth running at 1% and the current S&P 500 dividend yield running around 1.6%, the combination of current estimated earnings growth and dividend yield would be 2.6% for the S&P 500. The combination of VICI's midpoint AFFO growth and our current dividend yield would be over 14%.  With that, I'll turn it over to John for his remarks. John? John? It definitely has, Steve, and good to talk to you. The lack of visibility right now almost equals opacity. And you just need a week like this one in the markets to be reminded, in case you need a reminder as to how uncertain things are. So as John spoke of, we really have so much confidence right now in our operators, and we believe our gaming operators are going to continue to do very well for a host of reasons, particularly having to do with the demand drivers that Vegas enjoys for at least the next couple of years. But when it comes to the access to and cost of capital, we have to be as silver as everyone else has to be about the fact that obviously, credit conditions have tightened, we have definitely benefited from a cost advantage on cost of equity given how well we performed. But we certainly need to be careful about underwriting yields that probably do need to be higher than they've been over the last couple of years. And we also have to be very mindful if we're in consumer discretionary, which we are as to what a tenant's performance might be under different operating scenarios, should we see soft lending, hard landing, prolonged soft, prolonged hard landing. We also have -- need to be mindful of inflation. But we obviously do enjoy versus many of our REIT peers, certainly net lease REIT peers, the advantage of some CPI protections that definitely benefit our investors this year in 2023. I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Steve. But the way we think about growth is we think about growing both categorically and geographically, -- and so as you watch us, as you actually see what we did last year and as you look at us going forward, we will always be looking for great opportunities to grow into new categories as we did last year with Cabot and Canyon Ranch. And we look to grow in new geographies as we do with Canada. But I'll turn it over to John for his thoughts on how to how to think about the way we look at the U.S. versus international. John? Yes. So you're right, Smedes, we won't comment on any specific situations. But we have talked in the past on our earnings call and in our investor engagements about our interest in the theme park space. We think it has an awful lot of attributes to remind us in very good ways of our gaming investments. These are very complex assets. They're very large-scale assets. They're very capital-intensive assets. They have proven themselves over decades. What we also find interesting about the theme park landscape in the U.S. is it is really an un-networked landscape. You have hubs, obviously, in the form of Anaheim and Orlando, and you have spokes in terms of the regional theme park operators, but they're not connected and that kind of puzzles us and can't help thinking, well, geez, what would the power be if you could ever connect these things? And we'll see if anything ever comes to that. But yes, it is a category and experiential category that we believe has real investment merits for us, both strategically and economically. John? Yes, Wes, thanks for the question. David is best equipped to answer this. And I don't think David heard it quite clearly. And related to that, Wes. Go ahead. Go ahead, Wes. I was just going to say, needless to say, the pricing of capital right now is an exercise that is not easy to carry out. Obviously, having a forward view of the cost of capital in the future and then pricing our capital to a borrower or a partner. It's not an easy exercise. And go ahead, Wes. Gabe? Yes. David just covered the ears of Samantha Gallagher, RGC. Yes, John. Well, we -- okay, so to be really forthright, if 5 years ago, if you had said, okay, I want your prediction for the next 5 years ahead, I would not have predicted what we had done. We always had a conviction that we had a wonderful opportunity to institutionalize the real estate asset class that had not really yet been institutionalized. And we think so much of the story of this first 5 years, so much of our outperformance, 2x the S&P 500, 2x the NASDAQ. I probably should have mentioned that as well as hot as the NASDAQ was during much of that period, crazily hot at times. The NASDAQ performance over that 5 years was dead on the S&P 500 performance, and we beat them both by 2x, right? So as we look ahead, we certainly cannot base our strategy on continuing that kind of outperformance because to base our strategy on that kind of outperformance might involve -- would likely involve taking risk, so we're not sure we should take in terms of creating and sustaining value for our investors. So what you'll see us do over the next 5 years is continue to grow categorically, continue to grow geographically, do accretive deals be willing to over-equitize in the way David spoke of at the beginning and answering Tony's question and just make sure that we never put the value we've created together with our investors at risk. One of the great benefits. Or I shouldn't say one of the great benefits. One of the great drivers of our outperformance over the first 5 years is we never went backward for sustained periods. We obviously had volatility as everybody else did over that 5 years. We never went backward and stayed there for a long time. And we don't want to start doing that in the next 5 years. So I think you'll see us be disciplined in how we allocate capital. And in order to do that, we'll be disciplined in how we underwrite. And always look to learn from REITs who have succeeded in doing what we want to attempt to do. So whether it's a Prologis in terms of how they've grown internationally, whether it's great ideas and how you grow categorically. Like full marks to Sumit and the Realty Income team for the deal they announced this week on Plenty. Like that kind of deal making on the part of our peers really inspires us because it is evidence of how to think creatively and innovatively in developing into new categories. So I think that's what you can expect of us over the next 5 years, John. But -- and Ron, if I understand your question right, there is no question that the rent escalation that kicked in, in November for Caesars, and I believe it's January for Century definitely plays a role in generating that 10% AFFO growth. But to David's point, we obviously have -- toward the end of this year, we've only underwritten base level rent growth. We do not presume any kind of -- we do not make any CPI assumptions for forward rent, if that's of any help. And we don't include any unclosed acquisitions, just to be clear or on loans that do not have fixed draw schedules yet. John, you want to start? I would just add a little bit more to that, Ron. The last time we saw that the American commercial, I want to emphasize, commercial gaming sector was about 40% REITed that would contrast, say, with the mall space, which I believe is 70% plus REITed. The other thing to keep in mind is that we do have an American tribal gaming sector that is equal in size to American regional gaming. And we are now three or four tribal relationships, John and Danny. And that is a sector where those -- that sector is led by operators. We're very eager to do more business with in all the ways we can possibly think of. The thing I'll finally add is that there are obviously new jurisdictions opening up to gaming. And we just saw a headline this morning about Governor Abbott of Texas saying, if we're going to get gaming in Texas, I want it to be -- how did he put it, John? Great Wolf Lodge type of gaming. I can't remember exactly how -- yes. And we read that headline, we go that's great because we're already in business with Great Wolf, and we definitely are in business in gaming. So you look at a market like Texas and needless to say, we get quite excited given the capital allocation opportunities, a market like that could represent Well, as a starting point, David, and I'll turn this over to John in just a moment. As a starting point as a REIT, you can be confident we will perpetually raising equity. But we will be perpetually raising equity for years to come as all good growing REITs do to fund accretive growth that benefits all shareholders. And that's been our track record to date. It's evidenced by the kind of AFFO growth per share we're producing in 2023 and have on a compounded basis since our beginning in 2018. But again, so we will raise equity when the opportunities are there to do so. And we will raise equity to fund accretive acquisitions. In terms of the pipeline, I'll turn it over to John because we obviously have opportunities like the Indiana assets in our future. John? Hey, David, if I could just add one more thought... Yes. David, if I could add one more thought in relation to this, and it's something we haven't talked about on this call. But when it comes to being a growth-oriented REIT and when it comes to being a REIT, that will likely continue to access the capital markets, there is really no question in our minds and don't think there should be any question in anybody's mind as to the advantages of scale when it comes to access to the capital markets. And I think what you could see over the next few years is an increasing bifurcation or a barbell effect emerging across the American REIT landscape, where great advantages accrue to the biggest REIT with the most compelling value-creation stories because their access to capital in large volumes will be highly superior. You'll always have the small REITs that can produce significant growth in their early years. But the problem is you can reach a no-man's land of what we'll call mid-cap REITs, where it's really -- it's tough to access capital and high volumes and it gets a little bit tougher to produce material growth year-over-year-over-year. And we think at the scale we're at now, as I believe, the ninth largest REIT in the RMZ, it definitely brings advantages when it comes to access to and cost of capital. And sorry, I'll turn it back to you for your next question, David. We definitely worked on that, and we think there could be solutions down the road. In the near term, and I'll turn it over to John, our greatest excitement is helping them grow either off of tribal land or adjacent to tribal land. John? I would say, Todd, that our interest in nongaming hasn't diminished at all even amidst this lack of visibility around the consumer economy because of our strong conviction around the secular tailwinds of experiential businesses. We have seen with COVID, finally, starting to leave the landscape that what had been in place for the prior 10 years or so, 15 years prior to COVID, which was the increasing consumer preference for experiences over things, has definitely reasserted itself. And we don't think that, that's going to diminish. We think the aging of the baby boom into their prime leisure years, we think millennial family formation. Those are demographic waves, together with this increasing preference for experiences over things, is going to give experiential operators across a number of spectra really compelling growth opportunities and very strong economic performance, almost no matter what cyclicality looks like. Yes, it category by category, Jay -- and Elliot, this is just a heads up. This will have to be the last question. These categories, there are so many of them and so many of them run into the many, many tens of millions of dollars of growth opportunities, some larger, some smaller. But it is a landscape -- an experiential landscape that we feel represents decades of growth ahead for VICI. And Jay, thank you for that question, Elliot. I think we will close things out now. And I'll just -- for those of you who haven't heard enough about VICI today, as just flash across the screen on CNBC, I will on Mad Money in the night, in case you haven't heard enough. And with that, thank you all for your time today and really appreciate your attention to VICI and we're very excited about the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us. That's it for now. Thank you."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2022 demonstrated the continued discipline we have maintained over our 5-plus years of existence by ensuring that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. This focus provided VICI with continued access to the capital markets throughout 2022 to support our growth and just to recap a few highlights from the year. In April, we achieved our goal of an investment-grade credit rating as both S&P and Fitch rated VICI BBB- allowing us to raise $5 billion of investment-grade debt across a series of three, five, seven, 10 and 30-year tenures to fund the acquisition of MGP. VICI's ability to access the 30-year tenure was a first for a first-time investment-grade REIT issuer, and we are thankful for the support we received from our credit partners in this transaction. In June, we were added to the S&P 500 Index, marking the fastest time line a REIT has been added to the index from IPO to inclusion, deepening our access to equity capital. In November, we raised $575.6 million of net equity proceeds through a 19 million share forward sale agreement. We utilized the ATM throughout the year, raising equity very efficiently for a total of $696.6 million in net proceeds through the sale of 21.6 million shares via forward sale agreements. Those amounts include $208.3 million through the sale of 6.3 million shares via forward sale agreements that occurred in Q4. Then subsequent to year-end, in January, we raised $965 million of net equity proceeds through a 30.3 million share forward sale agreement, which remains unsettled today and available to fund future transactions. Currently, we have approximately $3.8 billion in total liquidity comprised of $426 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022. We have the $965 million of net proceeds from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. As a reminder, in January, we drew down CAD 140 million or approximately USD 103 million under our revolver in connection with our PURE Canadian gaming acquisition. We will look to term out this revolver draw in the future.  In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of CMBS debt that encumbers the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of activity from our recent acquisitions is approximately 5.7x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.7 years to maturity.  Turning to the income statement. Total GAAP revenues increased 100.9% year-over-year to $769.9 million in Q4 as a result of the transformative 2022 acquisition activity John mentioned. AFFO for the fourth quarter was approximately $488 million or $0.51 per share. Total AFFO in Q4 increased approximately 75% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 15.5% over the prior year. Just as a reminder, the disparity between overall AFFO growth and the AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raise and shares issued to consummate our acquisition of MGP during Q2 and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort during Q1 of last year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2%, one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.  Turning to guidance. We are initiating AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO at year ending December 31, 2023 is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 per share and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance reflects the full year of 2022 closed acquisitions as well as the acquisitions we completed in January, the PURE Canadian Gaming acquisition and the acquisition of Blackstone's 49.9% stake in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Additionally, the per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 30.3 million forward shares sold in January of this year. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. And as we have discussed with you in the past, we recorded a noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Great to talk to, Tony. Just to level set, our first maturity or next maturity comes due in May 1, 2024, for the $1.50 billion of 5.625 notes that come due. So we have no maturities due in 2023. And I think we'll continue to focus on bringing the leverage back down to 5x and 5.5x. And just to remind everybody, when we consummated the MGP acquisition we worked with the agencies and help them understand the merits of the deal, and they were thrilled with the transaction, given the diversity and allowing us to take leverage up just north of our 5 and 5.5 guidepost.  And so as you saw us do at the end of last year and with the significant free cash flow we have in the business, we'll over-equitize some of the smaller acquisitions, use free cash flow to fund some of the smaller acquisitions and the loan fundings that we have. And then as we navigate potentially larger transactions, we look to match fund that as efficiently as possible. But again, with the goal of bringing leverage over time back down to 5x to 5.5x. Yes, Steve, that end of your question has the key, right? What's the currency risk and what's the tax leakage and then underwriting a yield that makes sense to take that into account. And we did that with the PURE Canadian transaction. And as John mentioned, we're learning about other parts of the globe and where our capital can make sense. I mean it's and then where we can efficiently structure transactions that work for both sides. Yes. Barry, I can start, and John chime in with anything I missed. But look, we went in -- we've looked at this asset over a period of a number of years, and I think it's a phenomenal asset and even better backed by the equity support of the Koch Industries. And then the Soffer organization, we'll have the vision and get it open towards the end of this year. So there's nothing formal in terms of our relationship in terms of a path to real estate ownership. But when you act as good partners, and you'll help support other partners' objectives. That leads to more opportunities and just the size and scale of industries and everything that they have and the size of their real estate book, especially focused in leisure and hospitality, we think there could be more things to come in the future, and we're excited to partner with them and be involved with that project. Wes, I think I caught it, you say when we set the rates for these Partner Property Growth Funds. Is that -- did I get that right? Yes. The rates are not locked in, Wes, so it's part of the negotiation. When we obviously announced Hard Rock's acquisition of the Mirage, we said we'd be happy to commit up to $1.5 billion of our Partner Property Growth Fund or even more if they needed it, but that would all be subject to negotiation in terms of final terms, rate, structure, timing. Ron, it's David. Nice to talk here. It's all driven by -- well, said differently the way, we modeled the escalator in November with Caesars is 2%. We do not make any predictions about the future. My counsel next to me would be very upset. And then -- so the acquisitions, as I mentioned in my remarks, are all baked in, including the PURE deal, which closed in early January as well as the reconsolidation in early January as well. And then it does not include Rocky Gap, which is still outstanding. Todd, it's David. Good to talk to you. I mean as a net lease REIT, obviously, we're a spread investor, and we have to ensure that we receive an appropriate spread for the risk of the investment and to factor the location and the asset, the tenant, the business and taking that all into account in our underwriting. And the last part of your question there is spot on, right? And you've heard this from other net lease REITs, right? There's still a bid-ask spread for a lot of folks in terms of what they think the asset is worth and what we can actually acquire that with an appropriate rent coverage and generate an attractive return -- attractive risk-adjusted returns. So I would tell you we're being more diligent in terms of underwriting the business, the proof of concept, the longevity of concept, everything that we've talked about since day one of this company. Is there an enduring experience the consumers are going to go to over time. And so we're spending more time and going deeper on some certain sectors where we think there's some opportunities and larger growth opportunities going forward in those sectors. So we expect that to be wide. I mean we always want to generate 100 basis points to 150 basis points spread to our cost of capital. It's kind of what we set as a preliminary benchmark, now that can be higher at times or it can be lower at times depending on the quality of the asset, the operator or a riskier asset and riskier operator or locations in the country. Yes, Jay, it's David. I mean with our capital, we always want to find what makes sense at the right point in time with ideally a path to real estate ownership. And as I mentioned earlier, we do not have a direct path to real estate ownership with the Fontainebleau, but we developed a phenomenal relationship with Koch and Soffer that could lead to other opportunities. But as we've talked about with our Partner Property Growth Funds with other -- we talked with other gaming operators and non-gaming operators above ground-up development. We are doing that with Canyon Ranch. We're doing that with -- in a forum with Cabot in the golf opportunities. So the nice thing about our capital, it is flexible. It can come into different parts of the capital stack, so to speak. But again, ideally, we have a path to real estate ownership over the long term where we can continue to generate the types of returns and growth that we've done in our first 5 years."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, October 28, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.vicipropertys.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company\u2019s SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company\u2019s operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2022 earnings release and our supplemental information. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties described herein, please refer to respective company\u2019s public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Acquisitions and Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha and good morning everyone. The third quarter of 2022 for VICI was a quarter of both realization and continuing activation. By realization, I mean that in Q3 2022, we realized the full magnitude and impact of our growth activities in 2021. And by activation, I mean that we continue to create incremental capital allocation opportunities for VICI, especially in non-gaming. The key benefits realized in Q3 2022 included growing our revenue by 100% versus the same quarter in 2021, manifesting the full impact of our acquisitions of the Venetian and MGP; growing our AFFO by 83% year-over-year; growing AFFO per share by 8.5% year-over-year; announcing a dividend increase of 8.3%, giving VICI a dividend compound annual growth rate of 8.2% since our emergence in October 2017. Our key growth activities in Q3 and early Q4 included announcing an additional $186 million of financings within our partnership with Great Wolf Resorts; announcing our $203.9 million acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort; announcing a $200 million real estate financing partnership with Canyon Ranch. In 2022, we have invested in relationships with high-quality partners operating in high-quality experiential segments. Our year-to-date capital allocation commitments, the ones I just mentioned, plus our Cabot investment announced in June 2022 are expected to generate a going-in weighted average unlevered yield on investment of approximately 7.4%, as this nearly $710 million of capital is deployed over time. Before I turn the call over to John Payne and David Kieske, who will talk about our outlook, growth activities and financial results, I want to say a few words about our new partnership with Canyon Ranch, which we announced just last week. When we announced our new partnership with Cabot Golf back in June, you heard me talk about our belief in the power and moat qualities of what we call Pilgrim\u2019s experiences, many experiential categories, especially those with strong elements of expertise and/or knowledge accumulation are parameatal in shape. And at the apex of these pyramids are the purest rarest realizations of that category\u2019s experience. These are experiences that tend to attract within that experiential category, the most valuable and loyal clientele, able and willing through all cycles to pay a premium for the purest realization of the experience to which they are devoted. At VICI, as real estate investors, our thesis is a simple, and we believe, powerful one. Places of pilgrimage are places of great value. We want to and we are investing in these places. Cabot creates and operates golf resorts that represent pilgrimage experiences in golf. We are proud and excited to partner with Cabot on the creation of Cabot Citrus Farms. It\u2019s our next pilgrimage destination and we believe we can partner on many subsequent opportunities with Cabot. Of us note as well the Las Vegas Strip is also a pilgrimage destination for people seeking Apex experiences of all kinds. I was just there this week. It is the busiest place on earth. In the experiential category of wellness and personal performance, Canyon Ranch has been, is, and I believe will be for decades to come, the market leader, creating an operating resort that represents a definition of pilgrimage experiences and wellness. The Canyon Ranch brand was born in 1974. For nearly 50 years now, Canyon Ranch\u2019s clientele has traveled to Canyon Ranch Resorts to make the most important investment they can make, an investment in themselves, in the betterment of their lives, body, mind and spirit. The Canyon Ranch clientele, in order to make this investment and trust themselves to the Canyon Ranch team, an active trust that the Canyon Ranch team takes with existential seriousness. Under the leadership of Chairman and Principal owner, John Goff, a legend in American real estate investing through his creation of Crescent Real Estate and CEO, Jeff Kuster, formerly North American Head for Ralph Lauren. Canyon Ranch has built a wellness and humid performance team of great strength and authority. This team includes by way of example, a former U.S. Surgeon General, a former Head of Sports Medicine Research and Innovation at the U.S. Olympic Committee; a former Head of Physical Therapy for the U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer team; a former strength coach with the Philadelphia 76ers; a nationally renowned behavioral therapists; physicians who have pioneered integrated and lifestyle medicine fields; former Chef Dietitian at the U.S. Olympic Committee; and a Harvard Divinity School appointed spiritual innovator. The Canyon Ranch clientele is able and willing to pay through all cyclicals premium for the experiences and life improvements they obtain at Canyon Ranch. As many of you know, I have worked across ski resorts, heli ski resorts, beach resorts, golf resorts and now casino sorts. I can tell you, based on my experience that the Canyon Ranch capital and operating economic model, is among the most compelling and productive I have seen in revenue intensity per dollar of capital invested, in margins and in the returns on invested capital. Canyon Ranch, we believe will benefit greatly for decades to come from highly positive demographic and cultural tailwinds. The growth opportunities for Canyon Ranch are manifold both domestically and internationally and we are very excited to be Canyon Ranch\u2019s capital partner funding this growth. You can hear John Goff speak of the role he sees VICI playing in Canyon Ranch\u2019s growth. If you watch the Mad Money segment that John and I did with Jim Cramer on October 17. That clip can be found at our website, www.viciproperties.com. Finally, we are particularly excited about our first investment with Canyon Ranch, because it enables us to invest capital into and ultimately gives us the opportunity to own high-quality real estate in one of America\u2019s most dynamic metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, a region that, at least for the foreseeable future, we cannot invest in through gaming. Let me now turn the call over to John Payne, who will talk about our outlook and growth activities. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s good to be talking to you this morning. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort in partnership with our existing tenant, Century Casinos. Upon closing, rent under our master lease with Century will increase by $15.5 million, representing a 7.6% acquisition cap rate. Given our relationship with Century, we were able to leverage our existing master lease and our combined cost of capital to structure a transaction that work for all three parties involved, that being VICI, Century and Golden Entertainment, the seller of the asset. We are excited about expanding our relationship with Century as we have witnessed their relentless operating focus firsthand since we jointly acquired three regional assets in 2019. And upon the closing of Rocky Gap, we look forward to adding another remarkable regional destination asset to our portfolio. Moving to the outlook for growth, we are often asked how the transaction environment appears in real time. I will repeat something I often say, which is that transactions do not come together overnight. Ed touched on our Great Wolf, Cabot and Canyon Ranch partnerships and I would simply point out that the transactions we are able to discuss today represent just a fraction of the effort we undertake behind the scenes. Throughout the third quarter, our team remained as busy as ever introduced in our company to potential partners and forging relationships across a variety of sectors. In fact, our entire company is actively involved in finding ways to position VICI as the capital partner of choice for gaming and experiential operators. As you can imagine, capital market fluctuations can make it challenging to pinpoint our exact cost of capital at any given time. However, I stress that remaining discipline is core to our underwriting process. The landscape for transactions remains competitive and it\u2019s important to understand that seller expectations do not necessarily adjust in real time. With that said, at VICI, we focus on what we can control, which is one, our partnership approach. We encourage potential partners to speak to our existing tenants and believe we can position ourselves to ultimately win the ties. Two, disciplined and rigorous underwriting, we strive for accretion in every transaction and thanks to the work of our team, believe we can remain competitive. And third, finding ways to create our own success, the landscape for PropCo transaction is not zero-sum. We have learned to adapt to a variety of scenarios and believe we can uncover opportunities that may not be obvious to our competitors. Just a few weeks ago, we crossed the 5-year mark since we started the company. We wholeheartedly believe that our track record, which includes over $30 billion of transaction, speaks to our relentless focus and dedication to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to adhere to the approach that is responsible for our success to-date and will strive to grow the company accretively for years to come. Now, I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and access to capital. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. We are clearly in a volatile macro environment where ongoing inflation and rising interest rates are not only dominating the financial news, but also factoring into the transaction market requiring buyers and sellers to adjust to a market backdrop we have not seen in many years. As John mentioned, VICI turned 5 years old on October 6. And since our inception, we have been disciplined in maintaining a positive spread to our cost of capital. So even in an environment where the 10-year treasury rate is north of 4%, a rate that many younger investors have never seen in their lifetime, VICI is focused on maintaining discipline in everything we pursue. We are fortunate that we have built a balance sheet to weather these turbulent times with no floating rate debt, no maturities until 2024 and ample liquidity to deploy capital accretively with leading operators like we did with Century, Great Wolf and Canyon Ranch since the second quarter. In terms of VICI\u2019s liquidity and balance sheet, as of September 30, we had approximately $4.7 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $726 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $490 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our outstanding forward sale agreements, $2.5 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw term loan. During the quarter, we sold approximately 3.9 million shares with an aggregate value of $135 million after fees under our ATM program. All of the shares were sold subject to a forward sale agreement and as such are not reflected on our balance sheet. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.9 years to maturity. Turning to the income statement, as Ed mentioned, we doubled our GAAP revenue year-over-year, a feat we are very proud of and I want to thank the entire VICI team for all their efforts in delivering this growth. AFFO for the third quarter was approximately $471 million or $0.49 per share. Total AFFO in Q3 increased 83% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased 8.5% over the prior year. As a reminder, the disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count which increased primarily from the equity raised in shares issued to consummate our transformative acquisition of MGP during Q2 and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort during Q1 of this year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $12.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Turning to guidance, we are updating AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2022 is expected to be between $1.682 billion and $1.692 billion or between $1.91 and $1.92 per diluted common share. Our updated guidance reflects the uncapped CPI lease escalation of 8.1% that VICI will receive under our Las Vegas master lease and regional master lease with Caesars, effective for the lease year beginning on November 1, 2022. Additionally, the per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 15.3 million forward shares sold under our ATM program during Q2 and Q3. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other non-recurring transactions. As we have discussed in the past with you, we record a non-cash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO-focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Megan, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone. Your line is now open.\nAnthony Paolone: Thank you and good morning. I was wondering can you talk about just your efforts to look at investments internationally and how that\u2019s coming on and also just your appetite around that given what happening around the world?\nEd Pitoniak: John, do you want to start?\nJohn Payne: Sure. Good morning, Tony, how are you? Nice to talk to you. So it\u2019s definitely been something that we have been focused on for the past couple of years, you\u2019ve heard us talk about this that we\u2019ve grown, obviously, domestically in our first 5 years, but we always have positioned the company to grow internationally and we\u2019re spending time not only in the casino sector but also in the experiential sector outside the U.S. and study in markets where we think we would like to own real estate, and we\u2019re in the middle of that process and understanding the underwriting and understanding the countries where we would own real estate and their laws and we\u2019re right in the middle of it, Tony. Nothing to announce at this time, but it\u2019s of interest for us to grow internationally.\nAnthony Paolone: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Can you hear me?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, thanks. Ed, I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about where you\u2019re seeing more opportunities? Is it with sort of some of the public gaming companies that have seen a big change in their cost of capital and debt markets? Or is it more on the private side with companies like Cabot and Canyon Ranch where maybe cost of capital is even less available?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Steve, and good to talk to you. I would say we\u2019re seeing opportunities on both sides. I would say the private side, though, to your, I think implicit point is probably even richer fishing ground right now. And that has to do really with the state of the credit markets. As most of you on this call know, bank credit, especially to real estate credits has effectively dried up and I was reading the transcript as the Blackstone call last week, which I always do because if you don\u2019t listen to what John Gray is saying at any given time, you\u2019re missing an opportunity to pick up a lot of intelligence, and I thought it was telling the degree to which John was emphasizing to read it, they believe a lot of their real estate capital allocation in the near to midterm is going to be credit-focused. And you\u2019ve seen that from us as well. I would say that we\u2019re at a point in the cycle where would be sellers have still not gotten the memo that the world has changed radically. And as an indication of how radically the world has changed, I\u2019ve been trading e-mails with Mark Streeter at JPMorgan, the IG REIT credit analyst, and he sent me these graphs of the volatility of credit. And if those were EKG, that patient would be in a world of hurt. And then I saw last night from Hartnett that U.S. treasury performance this year is the worst since 1788 when the United States of America was a funky little startup. So the state of the credit market is, to your point, Steve, like it\u2019s tough if you don\u2019t have access to capital. And as David just emphasized, we\u2019ve got over $4 billion of liquidity. We\u2019ve got almost $1.3 billion of effective cash, and we are very excited to put that to work. We will put it in both with private operators and public. And in some cases, it will go into credit in the near to midterm with conversion to real estate ownership in most cases. in order to, frankly, capitalize on the fact that we have capital when a lot of other people don\u2019t.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. If I could just ask one other question, I know you\u2019re probably not giving individual yields on, say, Cabot and Canyon Ranch, but could you help us think about the yields maybe a broad sense for those development yields, which clearly carry more risk versus kind of stabilized acquisition yields and deals that you might get on your road for. So just how are you thinking about yields on development versus maybe stabilized acquisitions?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Well, clearly, Steve, we do need to be compensated for the risk that is associated with development. And I\u2019ll just go back to the 7.4% unlevered yield for the nearly 700 some million of capital that we\u2019ve deployed in Q2 and early Q3 and I think that 7.4% unlevered yield going in to give people comfort that we have been adequately compensated for our risk.\nSteve Sakwa: Great, thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nR.J. Milligan: Hey, good morning, guys. Certainly, appreciate your comments on cost of capital and maintaining discipline and certainly, the track record that you guys do only do deals that are accretive but I\u2019m curious how you view your cost of capital today, how do you calculate it? And I guess given John\u2019s comments that sellers\u2019 expectations don\u2019t always adjust with the changing cost of capital. Do you expect a pause on external growth on more of the middle of the fairway gaming assets while the bid-ask spread remains relatively wide?\nEd Pitoniak: David, do you want to start on that?\nDavid Kieske: Sure. Great, R.J., it\u2019s great talk to you. I mean one of the \u2013 we have this debate every day internally, right? When you see the 10-year moving 10, 15, 25 basis points, and obviously, the stock market is doing what it\u2019s doing, hard to price a deal on a daily basis. So we look at \u2013 but we do look at the spread to our cost of capital. And right now, look, we\u2019re getting 10-year pricing at 7%. So the $5 billion that we raised back in April, 5%, net adjusted at 4.5% with our hedge portfolio looks really, really good. But R.J., we\u2019re going to always maintain the spread to our cost of capital. Obviously, our stock has held up well. Debt pricing is what it is. As Ed just touched on, we have $1.3 billion of liquidity that is on the balance sheet, which does not include the term loan or the revolver. Being cognizant that cash is not free and that there is an implicit cost of that cash, we are going to ensure that we continue to do the deals that we\u2019ve done in the past, maintaining that spread. And your comment around kind of middle of the fairway deals, I think you\u2019ll see more of the Rocky Gaps of the world were a little bit smaller deals and some of the large mega deals will probably take a pause for a while just given the uncertainty around kind of where the world is ultimately going. But we feel good about our pipeline. I think it\u2019s busier than it\u2019s ever been, and the dialogue is greater than it\u2019s ever been but we\u2019ve got to be relentless in ensuring that we can continue to deliver consistent accretion year in and year out for our shareholders.\nR.J. Milligan: Thanks, David. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up \u2013 go ahead, Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: I was just going to say, R.J. And while obviously, the cost of debt capital has been incredibly volatile. And for most REITs, the cost of equity capital has been very volatile or just simply negatively trending. We are in a unique position where our equity on a relative basis, has held up so well with us having been the best-performing S&P 500 REIT year-to-date through September 30, and I\u2019m guessing as of yesterday, we still are. So we do have a strength to our equity price or equity cost that on a comparative basis does represent competitive advantage. Back to you, R.J.\nR.J. Milligan: Thanks. Just as a follow-up, given that bid-ask spread for sort of the middle of the fairway gaming assets, do the call options that you guys have become a more attractive option to sort of bridge the gap until cap rates adjust?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: So R.J., it\u2019s nice to talk to you this morning. When you\u2019re speaking \u2013 I think you\u2019re speaking more of the one foot call we have on the Indiana assets, and we continue to watch the great performance that our tenant, Caesars, has been handling these assets. They have capital still going into the two assets in Indianapolis. They have rebranded both of those casinos and they continue to grow. So we will continue to look at those. Those \u2013 the put call is active all the way through 2024. We sit here in October of 2022. So \u2013 we will monitor them. We love those assets. We really like what Caesars is doing with them and in growing that business. And like I said, we will continue to look at those over time.\nR.J. Milligan: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you. David, I was just wondering, as you think about the positioning of the balance sheet and obviously 5.8x pro forma today and likely to go down in the absence of transactions. How much does the current rate environment change the parameters that you want to operate within?\nDavid Kieske: It\u2019s a good question, Carlo. Good to speak to you. I hope you\u2019re well. Look, the current rate environment is it bounces around every day. And so we\u2019ve got to run the business taking a long-term view, but being mindful of if we had to price something or if we had to close on something today or in the near-term, how that would impact ultimately accretion, right? We\u2019ve got to drive accretive deals and be disciplined in what we\u2019ve done since day 1. So it\u2019s something we watch. We\u2019ve got access to the revolver. We\u2019ve got access to the late draw term loan. Thankfully, we have no maturities until 2024, where we have to go to the debt markets, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to be monitoring and making sure that we continue to drive growth to the balance sheet \u2013 through the balance sheet and can maintain the balance sheet and position of strength and as you said, bringing down leverage over time through potentially funding deals with our free cash flow.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wesley Golladay with Baird. Your line is now open.\nWesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. You guys are having a good success with follow-on deals. You seem to be in a good negotiation position with good relative cost of capital. But you did mention sellers are a little bit slow to adjust to pricing. Are you looking to potentially get some exclusivity rights to their expansion as a way to maybe bridge the gap on the pricing at this point?\nEd Pitoniak: If I understand your question correctly, Wes, and good to talk to you. I would say that when we form partnerships with the likes of Cabot and Canyon Ranch and Great Wolf and others, we\u2019re most interested in developing relationships for the long-term that give us a steady flow of capital allocation opportunities. Obviously, we want to be properly priced, we want our investors to enjoy the yields that they deserve to enjoy off of these investments. But I would say it\u2019s more about developing a long-term pipeline as opposed to using any kind of negotiating leverage or anything else, frankly, to enhance pricing per se. I mean, we\u2019re very satisfied with the pricing. As I noted in my remarks with Steve, a 7.4% blended unlevered yield across both development and existing assets, we think is pretty good, pretty good yield in this environment. In fact, meaning is a really good deal. I wouldn\u2019t say that we necessarily use these long-term partnerships in order to acquire pricing as much as we do to acquire a long-term pipeline of growth.\nWesley Golladay: Yes, I think what I was looking at is, yes, you look at \u2013 it looks like you have some \u2013 you get the initial yield, which is good, that may be a little bit slow to adjust but then you will have some kind of other value, whether it\u2019s your embedded options, maybe an exclusivity. I was just wondering if there is anything more qualitative or more structural than an initial nominal yield that you may be able to get and it sounds like it\u2019s just more based we\u2019re just going to have this good relationship and it\u2019s going to naturally lead to more deals, which is currently occurring.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. And one factor, Wes, especially when you\u2019ve got a team as small as our VICI team, where we\u2019re still just a couple of dozen people with probably lowest G&A among all the big REITs as a percentage of revenue, is that one of the benefits of forming these long-term partnerships is that we create the foundational documentation that enables us to basically rinse and repeat as we continue to grow with those partners.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. Great, thanks for the time, everyone.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Wes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with SMBC. Your line is now open.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So some of these non-gaming investments you guys are taking on the role of a lone ranger, if I can put it that way, as a way to sort of step in on these things. And I\u2019m curious, is there a situation where that sort of strategy of investing and sort of taking the pulse of these investments initially does it break down at all in this environment? And if it did, would you be willing to be a little bit higher or I should say, lower in the capital stack in any of these Great Wolf, Canyon Ranch, Cabot and so on. What\u2019s your appetite for taking on more risk at the outset of these non-gaming assets?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I\u2019ll turn it over to David in a moment, Richard, and good to talk to you. Obviously, when we go into these relationships, we really \u2013 we work hard to make sure that our last dollar exposure is a level of last dollar exposure we\u2019re very comfortable with, such that if we ever did have to step in, we\u2019re stepping into a situation that at that last dollar level of exposure for us is very well protected and means that there is still a lot of value left in the asset. Beyond that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David for his thoughts.\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Rich. Great to talk to you. The one thing that we like about these loan investments as it gives us a seat at the table. It gives us insight to the business. It gives us exposure to the operator and as you have seen with Cabot and Canyon a path to real estate ownership. And so things like the Great Wolf where we \u2013 our attachment point, as I said, is 75% LTC. I think your question is, would we be willing to go higher or potentially even provide a senior portion we would if it\u2019s the right operator, the right sponsor and the right relationship and again, the overall cost of capital \u2013 return on that capital is commensurate with our capital. And I think the one thing to point out is, I know we refer to these as development, but they really build to suits and broader real estate parlance. And VICI is not doing the developing. We\u2019re partnered with high, high-quality developers set GMP contracts and oversight by very, very experienced builders. So while our development pipeline is robust, I think you could potentially see it deviate, meaning we could go lower in the Captec or even higher depending on what happens with the credit markets and making sure that we are rewarded for that.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. And then the second question is the U.S. REIT model is largely a function of focused strategies. If you\u2019re a hotel REIT, you\u2019re a multifamily REIT and so on. You guys are more of the Berkshire Hathaway model and you are understanding that there is a shared knitting of pilgrimage \u2013 what I\u2019m saying \u2013 I can\u2019t pronounce that word for some reason this morning. But a common thread to them all experiential. You said just before you have a couple of dozen people working for you, how do you avoid pitfalls where one or some of these investments don\u2019t quite work out. Are you \u2013 should we expect to see a substantial increase in people with experience in these individual asset classes and so on? I\u2019m just curious how the overall entity will adapt as you expand your horizons and experiential real estate?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Richard, it\u2019s a very good question. It\u2019s a very top of mind question for both us as a management team and for our Board. And we do have a small team. I would just say, though, this has nothing to do with your question. I would say in an inflationary environment where G&A is so screamingly low as a percentage of revenue. Inflation obviously doesn\u2019t have an effect on our cost structure the way it will on others. What we do, Richard, in order to extend our reach is I believe we get more value out of our relationships with our advisers than anybody else we know of. From day 1, we have treated our advisers the best we possibly can so that when we go to them and say, hey, you know a lot about a category we want to learn a lot about, help us. They are right there for us. And so whether it\u2019s experiential categories or geographies with which we\u2019re not familiar internationally, we work with our advisers as if they are full members of the team. And that extends our reach in a way that\u2019s very cost effective, but it\u2019s also risk mitigating because we come up the learning curve on both categories and geographies very quickly.\nJohn Payne: And Rich, if I can \u2013 this is John. If I can just add one other thing on this, it\u2019s important to understand that when Ed and I started the company in October \u201817, we always position this REIT as an experiential REIT. In our first 5 years, we were more focused in the gambling space because we saw the opportunities there. But in the background, we were always spending time study in these different sectors that you now start to see investments that we\u2019re making. So this is not a shift of our company strategy at all. It\u2019s just you are starting to just see these new investments being made.\nRichard Anderson: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, good morning guys. Great to talk to you. Notwithstanding current capital market conditions and bid-ask spreads, I was hoping to get your thoughts on what inning you think you are in for U.S. gaming real estate deals? I guess just how penetrated is your addressable market here at this point? Thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Well, it\u2019s good to talk to you, Barry. We still think there is a lot of opportunity out there. I know we saw each other, you were in Vegas recently and you have heard me say we \u2013 there is no place. You have heard Ed say this. There is no place as busy as Las Vegas, and we obviously have great real estate on the strip. But there is many opportunities in the regional market in Las Vegas, the downtown market, there is other states that are opening that we do not own real estate. There is other locations that we do in own real estate. So, I don\u2019t know exactly what inning it is, but I would tell you, we still see incredible amount of opportunity to grow our business in owning casino real estate.\nBarry Jonas: Great. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. Do you think over time, gaming operators will or maybe should move to a full OpCo model? I mean I am assuming coverage is still the key question here, but curious if your thoughts here have evolved over time.\nEd Pitoniak: Barry, I think it\u2019s up to each operator to determine what\u2019s the best business model for them given the overall nature of their business. We think obviously, partners like MGM and Penn are demonstrating that they can be very successful in their capital-light, asset-light model. And at the same time, we have incredible admiration for the way Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker are running Caesars, where they maintain ownership of a lot of real estate. I think it will be interesting to tell over time. And I think the key question for anybody we partner with, whether in gaming or non-gaming, is if we do a deal, what would you do with the proceeds, right. If we do a sale leaseback with you, what will you do with the proceeds. And it\u2019s having a compelling use of proceeds that I think is one of the key determinants when you are an asset controller, whether in gaming or non-gaming as to how attractive having a sale-leaseback relationship with us would be.\nBarry Jonas: That\u2019s a great point. Alright. Thank you so much guys.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Barry.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nTodd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the discussion around your cost of capital and investment spreads. Your cost of equity capital has held up relatively well. Ed, you mentioned that, and it has, but it\u2019s also been volatile. The market has been volatile in general. And I am just curious how you manage deal flow and underwrite potential investments when that investment spread and your cost of capital may be volatile during that time that you are underwriting or negotiating deals? And I guess along those lines, is there any consideration? Clearly, you have liquidity which you have outlined. But is there any consideration for doing more on the ATM or issuing equity in advance of some potential transactions to lock in your cost of capital and provide even greater certainty of seller expectations might be gradually changing here?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Todd, good to talk to you. And I will turn it over to David in a moment. I would say one of the benefits of having the amount of liquidity we have, the $4.7 billion that David alluded to, and especially the $1.3 billion of basically equity capital, we already know the cost of is that we have a relative degree of cost certainty. I want to emphasize relatively. We will not have an absolute degree of cost certainty that a lot of others with much lower liquidity just simply do not have at this time. But I will turn it over to David for his further thoughts to your question.\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Todd, good to talk to you. I mean I think the implicit conversation was \u2013 or your question, excuse me, was are we shutting down our pipeline or are we pulling back. I mean I would tell you, we are busier than we have ever been as you saw on June 1st, we added a CIO, Kellan Florio from Goldman Sachs, who were thrilled about and is focused on opening more doors in the non-gaming world and has been very, very active. And so we constantly look at opportunities. But ultimately, if the opportunity doesn\u2019t make sense or the market backs up or there is a change, we will not pursue a deal that is not accretive, right. The minute we do a bad deal, that will be our last deal we do because we will not be able to raise capital going forward from our owners, our investors, both on the equity and the credit side. And we are living in a time that\u2019s pretty unique. Obviously, this sort of interest rate environment has not been around for many, many years, as Ed highlighted in his remarks and some of the charts that we have seen. But we will continue to be focused on raising liquidity like we did in June and August on the ATM, where we cut a little bit of tailwind in the equity markets and bolstered our balance sheet. But in terms of our intentions going forward, I can\u2019t talk about that. And we will see what tomorrow brings. But I think we have set up a balance sheet, we have set up a cost of capital that still can be competitive in this environment, but we are just going to be even more disciplined than we have in the past.\nEd Pitoniak: Hey Todd. I just want to add to David\u2019s remarks and I think it\u2019s pertinent to your question. If you look at the total liquidity that David outlined for you, about $4.7 billion, that represents \u2013 that is an amount, I should say, equal to about 10% of our current balance sheet, our $45 billion of enterprise value. I don\u2019t know how many other REITs out there have total liquidity equal to 10% of their balance sheet, especially if they are anywhere near as big as we are. And that really does represent the amount of firepower we have at a time when firepower is otherwise very hard \u2013 either very hard or very costly to achieve. The last point I would make is of that $4.7 billion of liquidity. And David, please correct me if I am wrong here, only $700 million of that $4.7 billion is actually currently on the balance sheet, the cash and the cash-like instruments that David referred to. The ATM proceeds and the delayed our term loan and the revolver, obviously, are not on the balance sheet because they all remain undrawn or unsettled.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. If I could just follow-up real quick then on the credit investments that you have made more recently here, you talked about Blackstone and clearly, there are other credit investors out there. I am just wondering if you could address the competitive landscape for these types of non-gaming credit investments and some of the transactions that you have announced more recently.\nEd Pitoniak: I will turn it over to David in a moment. But I think the fundamental issue that we are finding in anything that\u2019s resembling a competitive situation in terms of a would be borrower or partner evaluating our credit is, I think we are a lot easier, a lot friendlier to do business with. David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. I mean Todd, that\u2019s when it comes down to it. And I know that\u2019s hard to understand in order to put in your report, but relationships matter. You have heard John talk about it for years, if you see the clip that Ed referred to with John Goff and Jim Cramer and Ed on CNBC. He was very bullish about the opportunity to do more together. These are relationships that we foster and build and spend time with when we did Chelsea Piers back in June of 2020, it was competitive. It was a bid process. But part of our ability to win that was. One, our long-term view, we are not a fund driven. We don\u2019t have a fund life. And ultimately, our relationships mean a lot. And it\u2019s how you treat as Ed mentioned with respect to our advisors, we treat our counterparties extremely, extremely well because we want to do more together. We want both sides of the table to win and feel good and come back to the table to do more together in the future.\nEd Pitoniak: And just to add to that, Todd. When we are in these lending relationships, we don\u2019t see our partners to debt. We are not a GP that needs to pay our bills by seeing or would be credit partners to debt. And that not only makes an economic difference to them, it makes a relationship difference.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey. Good morning. Just first, a couple of quick ones here. So, given that we are four days away from November, are you able to disclose the CPI-based lease escalators that you are expecting release [ph]?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Greg. Good to talk to you. It was in my remarks, it\u2019s 8.1%.\nGreg McGinniss: My apologies. Thank you. And then also, given your current cost of capital, does the high 7% call rate on the Indian assets, can you make sense to you today?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: I talked about this a little bit earlier that we continue to watch this business grow capital from the operator. Caesars, the owner today, continues to go into the business. This call \u2013 this put call is active until the end of \u201824. So, we will continue to monitor the growth of the business. We will see the capital go in and we will determine the right time for this call option.\nGreg McGinniss: Alright. Thank you. And then just a final one for me, Ed, in the earnings release, you spoke about the multi-trillion dollar place-based wellness sector. I was just hoping you could expand on what concepts are actually included within that sector. And then broadly, where you think the best opportunity for investment might be and how you are thinking about structuring those investments that does sound like it\u2019s likely on the credit side right now?\nEd Pitoniak: Well, it\u2019s \u2013 well, to be clear, Greg, it\u2019s on the credit side right now with Canyon Ranch with a very clear path to own the real estate of Canyon Ranch Austin and also on real estate potentially in places like Tucson and Lennox and elsewhere that we can go together both domestically and internationally with Canyon Ranch. Obviously, we are most focused on the place-based dimension of global wellness. And I would say that based on the research we have done, one of the really appealing things about place-based wellness on a global basis is that the model from continent-to-continent is really quite similar. That\u2019s in contrast to gaming. The U.S., Singapore, Macau are notable for having great real estate intensity to their gaming models, but that real estate intensity is not found to the quite the same degree in a lot of other areas around the globe. On the other hand, again, place-based wellness is really very much the same kind of concept as you go from the U.S. to, for example, Europe and the UK where there are many operators operating very much like Canyon Ranch at the high end with a good amount of real estate intensity.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Thank you. So, I guess similar then to the type of model that we are seeing Canyon Ranch and the other types of operators that you would be looking to invest with in this space?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. And I mean when you think about it, historically, think about the great European spot towns that started to become popular back in the 1700s. The spa tradition has centuries of history. And the modern spa experiences grew out of those more ancient traditions frankly, it goes all the way back to the enrollment. The \u2013 they were in the spa business, right. This is a business that\u2019s actually now that they say it, it doesn\u2019t go back century, it goes back millennia.\nGreg McGinniss: So, you think it has the same power then, I guess is what you are saying?\nEd Pitoniak: I think that\u2019s pretty safe. Anyway, thank you, Greg.\nGreg McGinniss: Yes. Thanks Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDavid Katz: Hi everyone. Covered a lot of ground, and so I don\u2019t want to just pick up time on general principle. But one very specific question. As I talk to operators in gaming who I would have classified 12 months ago as kind of never counterparties for you? My sense is that there might be some softening to that end in those conversations. Would you concur with that?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Hey. Good morning David. I would. And I just think this is just a matter of time. We have been around for 5 years. And I think we have been out explaining why our form of capital can work for gaming operators, particularly as Ed said, when they have great use of proceeds to grow the company. And I think that many CFOs and CEOs of companies that said they would never do it now have spent the time to understand how our capital work and how we can be partners and are now thinking about it. Doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they will transact. But I think if you are in the C-suite of any company, you should be thinking about all the different ways that you can work with your balance sheet and structure your balance sheet. So, not surprising at all, David, that we are hearing \u2013 you are hearing that, and we are hearing that.\nDavid Katz: Both you and I know they should consider it until they do, that it sounds like they are. Apologies, Ed, please finish.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I was just going to say, David, to add on to John\u2019s remarks. If you go back to October 21st, the yield to worst on gaming high-yield credit on a blended basis was 8.21%, right. Actually the blended yield to worst on leisure was 10.03%. So, whether it\u2019s gaming operators or leisure operators, they are looking at current yield to worst on their high-yield credit and almost all of them are high yield, very few of them are IG. When they start to look at our cap rates, they realize that when they have to refinance this debt that\u2019s currently yielding 8.21% or higher, our capital could look very attractive.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you, when you potentially have opportunities in smaller regional gaming markets where maybe they have refinancing issues coming up and you have \u2013 as we talked about, it\u2019s a competitive cost of capital. But in a recessionary environment in smaller markets where potentially that demographic is more hit in a recession, do you think about how you underwrite your rent coverage in those? Would you expect to change that at all, or how do you kind of \u2013 I am just sort of wondering how you are sort of thinking about that as you look at these opportunities?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I will turn to John \u2013 John, just before I turn it over to you, I just want you acknowledge me that \u2013 we missed your friend and colleague, Michael Bilerman. We always enjoyed when Michael showed up on our calls, and we wish him the very best in his new role at Tanger. Anyway, over to you, John.\nJohn Payne: Yes, Smedes, it\u2019s a very good question, and we spend a lot of time in all the different markets with all the different operators as we look at deals, understanding the market, understanding their segmentation of their customers, what they are seeing. I think you know this because you follow gaming. It\u2019s a unique time for our tenants. We have spent a lot of time on this call talking about the market fluctuations. But in the gaming business right now, depending on what market and who you are talking to, some are having \u2013 continue to have record earnings. And almost all of the operators are seeing strong \u2013 continue to see strong business. So, we are very careful in whatever deal that we underwrite and understanding the market, the dynamics, the type of consumer, how far the consumer comes from, all of those things when we underwrite. And we will be careful as we look at regional markets in Las Vegas markets. But our tenants have done an amazing job in operating their businesses and continuing to grow them during this very unique time.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I just \u2013 I appreciate that. And just one thing I just wanted to ask you. I mean when we look at other triple net REITs. The transaction volume has come down a lot and cap rates aren\u2019t really moving. There is \u2013 as you have talked about, Ed, sort of the standoff between sellers and buyers. But in recent deals in gaming, I mean there haven\u2019t been that many, but cap rates have moved from prior announcements. So, I am just wondering, do you think this sort of asset class is more sort of willing to move? Are they in a position where they sort of need to move because they are financing issues, or I mean would you agree with that, that maybe things are adjusting a little quicker or not?\nEd Pitoniak: It\u2019s hard to tell, Smedes. Every deal is so specific whether it would be the geographic location, the asset is in, the nature of the asset itself, the tenant and its credit quality, I don\u2019t know. I would be \u2013 I would have a tough time saying that cap rates within gaming have moved considerably up, which is implicit in what you are saying, given the market backdrop. I think it\u2019s still a bit too early to tell, because I wouldn\u2019t generalize the fairly limited amount of activity that we and GLPI have engaged in over the last few months.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the conference back over to Edward Pitoniak for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you very much again. In closing, we simply want to thank you for your time with us today. We believe we are really well positioned at VICI to continue growing our portfolio during what may be \u2013 well, no, what is a very uncertain period while driving superior shareholder value. Again, thank you and good health to all.\nOperator: That concludes the VICI Properties\u2019 third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha and good morning everyone. The third quarter of 2022 for VICI was a quarter of both realization and continuing activation. By realization, I mean that in Q3 2022, we realized the full magnitude and impact of our growth activities in 2021. And by activation, I mean that we continue to create incremental capital allocation opportunities for VICI, especially in non-gaming. The key benefits realized in Q3 2022 included growing our revenue by 100% versus the same quarter in 2021, manifesting the full impact of our acquisitions of the Venetian and MGP; growing our AFFO by 83% year-over-year; growing AFFO per share by 8.5% year-over-year; announcing a dividend increase of 8.3%, giving VICI a dividend compound annual growth rate of 8.2% since our emergence in October 2017. Our key growth activities in Q3 and early Q4 included announcing an additional $186 million of financings within our partnership with Great Wolf Resorts; announcing our $203.9 million acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort; announcing a $200 million real estate financing partnership with Canyon Ranch. In 2022, we have invested in relationships with high-quality partners operating in high-quality experiential segments. Our year-to-date capital allocation commitments, the ones I just mentioned, plus our Cabot investment announced in June 2022 are expected to generate a going-in weighted average unlevered yield on investment of approximately 7.4%, as this nearly $710 million of capital is deployed over time. Before I turn the call over to John Payne and David Kieske, who will talk about our outlook, growth activities and financial results, I want to say a few words about our new partnership with Canyon Ranch, which we announced just last week. When we announced our new partnership with Cabot Golf back in June, you heard me talk about our belief in the power and moat qualities of what we call Pilgrim's experiences, many experiential categories, especially those with strong elements of expertise and/or knowledge accumulation are parameatal in shape. And at the apex of these pyramids are the purest rarest realizations of that category's experience. These are experiences that tend to attract within that experiential category, the most valuable and loyal clientele, able and willing through all cycles to pay a premium for the purest realization of the experience to which they are devoted. At VICI, as real estate investors, our thesis is a simple, and we believe, powerful one. Places of pilgrimage are places of great value. We want to and we are investing in these places. Cabot creates and operates golf resorts that represent pilgrimage experiences in golf. We are proud and excited to partner with Cabot on the creation of Cabot Citrus Farms. It's our next pilgrimage destination and we believe we can partner on many subsequent opportunities with Cabot. Of us note as well the Las Vegas Strip is also a pilgrimage destination for people seeking Apex experiences of all kinds. I was just there this week. It is the busiest place on earth. In the experiential category of wellness and personal performance, Canyon Ranch has been, is, and I believe will be for decades to come, the market leader, creating an operating resort that represents a definition of pilgrimage experiences and wellness. The Canyon Ranch brand was born in 1974. For nearly 50 years now, Canyon Ranch's clientele has traveled to Canyon Ranch Resorts to make the most important investment they can make, an investment in themselves, in the betterment of their lives, body, mind and spirit. The Canyon Ranch clientele, in order to make this investment and trust themselves to the Canyon Ranch team, an active trust that the Canyon Ranch team takes with existential seriousness. Under the leadership of Chairman and Principal owner, John Goff, a legend in American real estate investing through his creation of Crescent Real Estate and CEO, Jeff Kuster, formerly North American Head for Ralph Lauren. Canyon Ranch has built a wellness and humid performance team of great strength and authority. This team includes by way of example, a former U.S. Surgeon General, a former Head of Sports Medicine Research and Innovation at the U.S. Olympic Committee; a former Head of Physical Therapy for the U.S. Women's National Soccer team; a former strength coach with the Philadelphia 76ers; a nationally renowned behavioral therapists; physicians who have pioneered integrated and lifestyle medicine fields; former Chef Dietitian at the U.S. Olympic Committee; and a Harvard Divinity School appointed spiritual innovator. The Canyon Ranch clientele is able and willing to pay through all cyclicals premium for the experiences and life improvements they obtain at Canyon Ranch. As many of you know, I have worked across ski resorts, heli ski resorts, beach resorts, golf resorts and now casino sorts. I can tell you, based on my experience that the Canyon Ranch capital and operating economic model, is among the most compelling and productive I have seen in revenue intensity per dollar of capital invested, in margins and in the returns on invested capital. Canyon Ranch, we believe will benefit greatly for decades to come from highly positive demographic and cultural tailwinds. The growth opportunities for Canyon Ranch are manifold both domestically and internationally and we are very excited to be Canyon Ranch's capital partner funding this growth. You can hear John Goff speak of the role he sees VICI playing in Canyon Ranch's growth. If you watch the Mad Money segment that John and I did with Jim Cramer on October 17. That clip can be found at our website, www.viciproperties.com. Finally, we are particularly excited about our first investment with Canyon Ranch, because it enables us to invest capital into and ultimately gives us the opportunity to own high-quality real estate in one of America's most dynamic metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, a region that, at least for the foreseeable future, we cannot invest in through gaming. Let me now turn the call over to John Payne, who will talk about our outlook and growth activities. John? John, do you want to start? Yes. Yes. It's a good question, Steve, and good to talk to you. I would say we're seeing opportunities on both sides. I would say the private side, though, to your, I think implicit point is probably even richer fishing ground right now. And that has to do really with the state of the credit markets. As most of you on this call know, bank credit, especially to real estate credits has effectively dried up and I was reading the transcript as the Blackstone call last week, which I always do because if you don't listen to what John Gray is saying at any given time, you're missing an opportunity to pick up a lot of intelligence, and I thought it was telling the degree to which John was emphasizing to read it, they believe a lot of their real estate capital allocation in the near to midterm is going to be credit-focused. And you've seen that from us as well. I would say that we're at a point in the cycle where would be sellers have still not gotten the memo that the world has changed radically. And as an indication of how radically the world has changed, I've been trading e-mails with Mark Streeter at JPMorgan, the IG REIT credit analyst, and he sent me these graphs of the volatility of credit. And if those were EKG, that patient would be in a world of hurt. And then I saw last night from Hartnett that U.S. treasury performance this year is the worst since 1788 when the United States of America was a funky little startup. So the state of the credit market is, to your point, Steve, like it's tough if you don't have access to capital. And as David just emphasized, we've got over $4 billion of liquidity. We've got almost $1.3 billion of effective cash, and we are very excited to put that to work. We will put it in both with private operators and public. And in some cases, it will go into credit in the near to midterm with conversion to real estate ownership in most cases. in order to, frankly, capitalize on the fact that we have capital when a lot of other people don't. Yes. Well, clearly, Steve, we do need to be compensated for the risk that is associated with development. And I'll just go back to the 7.4% unlevered yield for the nearly 700 some million of capital that we've deployed in Q2 and early Q3 and I think that 7.4% unlevered yield going in to give people comfort that we have been adequately compensated for our risk. Thank you, Steve. David, do you want to start on that? I was just going to say, R.J. And while obviously, the cost of debt capital has been incredibly volatile. And for most REITs, the cost of equity capital has been very volatile or just simply negatively trending. We are in a unique position where our equity on a relative basis, has held up so well with us having been the best-performing S&P 500 REIT year-to-date through September 30, and I'm guessing as of yesterday, we still are. So we do have a strength to our equity price or equity cost that on a comparative basis does represent competitive advantage. Back to you, R.J. John? If I understand your question correctly, Wes, and good to talk to you. I would say that when we form partnerships with the likes of Cabot and Canyon Ranch and Great Wolf and others, we're most interested in developing relationships for the long-term that give us a steady flow of capital allocation opportunities. Obviously, we want to be properly priced, we want our investors to enjoy the yields that they deserve to enjoy off of these investments. But I would say it's more about developing a long-term pipeline as opposed to using any kind of negotiating leverage or anything else, frankly, to enhance pricing per se. I mean, we're very satisfied with the pricing. As I noted in my remarks with Steve, a 7.4% blended unlevered yield across both development and existing assets, we think is pretty good, pretty good yield in this environment. In fact, meaning is a really good deal. I wouldn't say that we necessarily use these long-term partnerships in order to acquire pricing as much as we do to acquire a long-term pipeline of growth. Yes. And one factor, Wes, especially when you've got a team as small as our VICI team, where we're still just a couple of dozen people with probably lowest G&A among all the big REITs as a percentage of revenue, is that one of the benefits of forming these long-term partnerships is that we create the foundational documentation that enables us to basically rinse and repeat as we continue to grow with those partners. Thank you, Wes. Yes. I'll turn it over to David in a moment, Richard, and good to talk to you. Obviously, when we go into these relationships, we really \u2013 we work hard to make sure that our last dollar exposure is a level of last dollar exposure we're very comfortable with, such that if we ever did have to step in, we're stepping into a situation that at that last dollar level of exposure for us is very well protected and means that there is still a lot of value left in the asset. Beyond that, I'll turn it over to David for his thoughts. Yes. Richard, it's a very good question. It's a very top of mind question for both us as a management team and for our Board. And we do have a small team. I would just say, though, this has nothing to do with your question. I would say in an inflationary environment where G&A is so screamingly low as a percentage of revenue. Inflation obviously doesn't have an effect on our cost structure the way it will on others. What we do, Richard, in order to extend our reach is I believe we get more value out of our relationships with our advisers than anybody else we know of. From day 1, we have treated our advisers the best we possibly can so that when we go to them and say, hey, you know a lot about a category we want to learn a lot about, help us. They are right there for us. And so whether it's experiential categories or geographies with which we're not familiar internationally, we work with our advisers as if they are full members of the team. And that extends our reach in a way that's very cost effective, but it's also risk mitigating because we come up the learning curve on both categories and geographies very quickly. John? Barry, I think it's up to each operator to determine what's the best business model for them given the overall nature of their business. We think obviously, partners like MGM and Penn are demonstrating that they can be very successful in their capital-light, asset-light model. And at the same time, we have incredible admiration for the way Tom Reeg and Bret Yunker are running Caesars, where they maintain ownership of a lot of real estate. I think it will be interesting to tell over time. And I think the key question for anybody we partner with, whether in gaming or non-gaming, is if we do a deal, what would you do with the proceeds, right. If we do a sale leaseback with you, what will you do with the proceeds. And it's having a compelling use of proceeds that I think is one of the key determinants when you are an asset controller, whether in gaming or non-gaming as to how attractive having a sale-leaseback relationship with us would be. Thank you, Barry. Yes. Todd, good to talk to you. And I will turn it over to David in a moment. I would say one of the benefits of having the amount of liquidity we have, the $4.7 billion that David alluded to, and especially the $1.3 billion of basically equity capital, we already know the cost of is that we have a relative degree of cost certainty. I want to emphasize relatively. We will not have an absolute degree of cost certainty that a lot of others with much lower liquidity just simply do not have at this time. But I will turn it over to David for his further thoughts to your question. Hey Todd. I just want to add to David's remarks and I think it's pertinent to your question. If you look at the total liquidity that David outlined for you, about $4.7 billion, that represents \u2013 that is an amount, I should say, equal to about 10% of our current balance sheet, our $45 billion of enterprise value. I don't know how many other REITs out there have total liquidity equal to 10% of their balance sheet, especially if they are anywhere near as big as we are. And that really does represent the amount of firepower we have at a time when firepower is otherwise very hard \u2013 either very hard or very costly to achieve. The last point I would make is of that $4.7 billion of liquidity. And David, please correct me if I am wrong here, only $700 million of that $4.7 billion is actually currently on the balance sheet, the cash and the cash-like instruments that David referred to. The ATM proceeds and the delayed our term loan and the revolver, obviously, are not on the balance sheet because they all remain undrawn or unsettled. I will turn it over to David in a moment. But I think the fundamental issue that we are finding in anything that's resembling a competitive situation in terms of a would be borrower or partner evaluating our credit is, I think we are a lot easier, a lot friendlier to do business with. David? And just to add to that, Todd. When we are in these lending relationships, we don't see our partners to debt. We are not a GP that needs to pay our bills by seeing or would be credit partners to debt. And that not only makes an economic difference to them, it makes a relationship difference. David? John? Well, it's \u2013 well, to be clear, Greg, it's on the credit side right now with Canyon Ranch with a very clear path to own the real estate of Canyon Ranch Austin and also on real estate potentially in places like Tucson and Lennox and elsewhere that we can go together both domestically and internationally with Canyon Ranch. Obviously, we are most focused on the place-based dimension of global wellness. And I would say that based on the research we have done, one of the really appealing things about place-based wellness on a global basis is that the model from continent-to-continent is really quite similar. That's in contrast to gaming. The U.S., Singapore, Macau are notable for having great real estate intensity to their gaming models, but that real estate intensity is not found to the quite the same degree in a lot of other areas around the globe. On the other hand, again, place-based wellness is really very much the same kind of concept as you go from the U.S. to, for example, Europe and the UK where there are many operators operating very much like Canyon Ranch at the high end with a good amount of real estate intensity. Yes. And I mean when you think about it, historically, think about the great European spot towns that started to become popular back in the 1700s. The spa tradition has centuries of history. And the modern spa experiences grew out of those more ancient traditions frankly, it goes all the way back to the enrollment. The \u2013 they were in the spa business, right. This is a business that's actually now that they say it, it doesn't go back century, it goes back millennia. I think that's pretty safe. Anyway, thank you, Greg. John? Yes. I was just going to say, David, to add on to John's remarks. If you go back to October 21st, the yield to worst on gaming high-yield credit on a blended basis was 8.21%, right. Actually the blended yield to worst on leisure was 10.03%. So, whether it's gaming operators or leisure operators, they are looking at current yield to worst on their high-yield credit and almost all of them are high yield, very few of them are IG. When they start to look at our cap rates, they realize that when they have to refinance this debt that's currently yielding 8.21% or higher, our capital could look very attractive. Yes. I will turn to John \u2013 John, just before I turn it over to you, I just want you acknowledge me that \u2013 we missed your friend and colleague, Michael Bilerman. We always enjoyed when Michael showed up on our calls, and we wish him the very best in his new role at Tanger. Anyway, over to you, John. It's hard to tell, Smedes. Every deal is so specific whether it would be the geographic location, the asset is in, the nature of the asset itself, the tenant and its credit quality, I don't know. I would be \u2013 I would have a tough time saying that cap rates within gaming have moved considerably up, which is implicit in what you are saying, given the market backdrop. I think it's still a bit too early to tell, because I wouldn't generalize the fairly limited amount of activity that we and GLPI have engaged in over the last few months."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. It's good to be talking to you this morning. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of Rocky Gap Casino Resort in partnership with our existing tenant, Century Casinos. Upon closing, rent under our master lease with Century will increase by $15.5 million, representing a 7.6% acquisition cap rate. Given our relationship with Century, we were able to leverage our existing master lease and our combined cost of capital to structure a transaction that work for all three parties involved, that being VICI, Century and Golden Entertainment, the seller of the asset. We are excited about expanding our relationship with Century as we have witnessed their relentless operating focus firsthand since we jointly acquired three regional assets in 2019. And upon the closing of Rocky Gap, we look forward to adding another remarkable regional destination asset to our portfolio. Moving to the outlook for growth, we are often asked how the transaction environment appears in real time. I will repeat something I often say, which is that transactions do not come together overnight. Ed touched on our Great Wolf, Cabot and Canyon Ranch partnerships and I would simply point out that the transactions we are able to discuss today represent just a fraction of the effort we undertake behind the scenes. Throughout the third quarter, our team remained as busy as ever introduced in our company to potential partners and forging relationships across a variety of sectors. In fact, our entire company is actively involved in finding ways to position VICI as the capital partner of choice for gaming and experiential operators. As you can imagine, capital market fluctuations can make it challenging to pinpoint our exact cost of capital at any given time. However, I stress that remaining discipline is core to our underwriting process. The landscape for transactions remains competitive and it's important to understand that seller expectations do not necessarily adjust in real time. With that said, at VICI, we focus on what we can control, which is one, our partnership approach. We encourage potential partners to speak to our existing tenants and believe we can position ourselves to ultimately win the ties. Two, disciplined and rigorous underwriting, we strive for accretion in every transaction and thanks to the work of our team, believe we can remain competitive. And third, finding ways to create our own success, the landscape for PropCo transaction is not zero-sum. We have learned to adapt to a variety of scenarios and believe we can uncover opportunities that may not be obvious to our competitors. Just a few weeks ago, we crossed the 5-year mark since we started the company. We wholeheartedly believe that our track record, which includes over $30 billion of transaction, speaks to our relentless focus and dedication to create long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to adhere to the approach that is responsible for our success to-date and will strive to grow the company accretively for years to come. Now, I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and access to capital. David? Sure. Good morning, Tony, how are you? Nice to talk to you. So it's definitely been something that we have been focused on for the past couple of years, you've heard us talk about this that we've grown, obviously, domestically in our first 5 years, but we always have positioned the company to grow internationally and we're spending time not only in the casino sector but also in the experiential sector outside the U.S. and study in markets where we think we would like to own real estate, and we're in the middle of that process and understanding the underwriting and understanding the countries where we would own real estate and their laws and we're right in the middle of it, Tony. Nothing to announce at this time, but it's of interest for us to grow internationally. So R.J., it's nice to talk to you this morning. When you're speaking \u2013 I think you're speaking more of the one foot call we have on the Indiana assets, and we continue to watch the great performance that our tenant, Caesars, has been handling these assets. They have capital still going into the two assets in Indianapolis. They have rebranded both of those casinos and they continue to grow. So we will continue to look at those. Those \u2013 the put call is active all the way through 2024. We sit here in October of 2022. So \u2013 we will monitor them. We love those assets. We really like what Caesars is doing with them and in growing that business. And like I said, we will continue to look at those over time. And Rich, if I can \u2013 this is John. If I can just add one other thing on this, it's important to understand that when Ed and I started the company in October \u201817, we always position this REIT as an experiential REIT. In our first 5 years, we were more focused in the gambling space because we saw the opportunities there. But in the background, we were always spending time study in these different sectors that you now start to see investments that we're making. So this is not a shift of our company strategy at all. It's just you are starting to just see these new investments being made. Yes. Well, it's good to talk to you, Barry. We still think there is a lot of opportunity out there. I know we saw each other, you were in Vegas recently and you have heard me say we \u2013 there is no place. You have heard Ed say this. There is no place as busy as Las Vegas, and we obviously have great real estate on the strip. But there is many opportunities in the regional market in Las Vegas, the downtown market, there is other states that are opening that we do not own real estate. There is other locations that we do in own real estate. So, I don't know exactly what inning it is, but I would tell you, we still see incredible amount of opportunity to grow our business in owning casino real estate. I talked about this a little bit earlier that we continue to watch this business grow capital from the operator. Caesars, the owner today, continues to go into the business. This call \u2013 this put call is active until the end of \u201824. So, we will continue to monitor the growth of the business. We will see the capital go in and we will determine the right time for this call option. Hey. Good morning David. I would. And I just think this is just a matter of time. We have been around for 5 years. And I think we have been out explaining why our form of capital can work for gaming operators, particularly as Ed said, when they have great use of proceeds to grow the company. And I think that many CFOs and CEOs of companies that said they would never do it now have spent the time to understand how our capital work and how we can be partners and are now thinking about it. Doesn't necessarily mean they will transact. But I think if you are in the C-suite of any company, you should be thinking about all the different ways that you can work with your balance sheet and structure your balance sheet. So, not surprising at all, David, that we are hearing \u2013 you are hearing that, and we are hearing that. Yes, Smedes, it's a very good question, and we spend a lot of time in all the different markets with all the different operators as we look at deals, understanding the market, understanding their segmentation of their customers, what they are seeing. I think you know this because you follow gaming. It's a unique time for our tenants. We have spent a lot of time on this call talking about the market fluctuations. But in the gaming business right now, depending on what market and who you are talking to, some are having \u2013 continue to have record earnings. And almost all of the operators are seeing strong \u2013 continue to see strong business. So, we are very careful in whatever deal that we underwrite and understanding the market, the dynamics, the type of consumer, how far the consumer comes from, all of those things when we underwrite. And we will be careful as we look at regional markets in Las Vegas markets. But our tenants have done an amazing job in operating their businesses and continuing to grow them during this very unique time."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. We are clearly in a volatile macro environment where ongoing inflation and rising interest rates are not only dominating the financial news, but also factoring into the transaction market requiring buyers and sellers to adjust to a market backdrop we have not seen in many years. As John mentioned, VICI turned 5 years old on October 6. And since our inception, we have been disciplined in maintaining a positive spread to our cost of capital. So even in an environment where the 10-year treasury rate is north of 4%, a rate that many younger investors have never seen in their lifetime, VICI is focused on maintaining discipline in everything we pursue. We are fortunate that we have built a balance sheet to weather these turbulent times with no floating rate debt, no maturities until 2024 and ample liquidity to deploy capital accretively with leading operators like we did with Century, Great Wolf and Canyon Ranch since the second quarter. In terms of VICI's liquidity and balance sheet, as of September 30, we had approximately $4.7 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $726 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $490 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our outstanding forward sale agreements, $2.5 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw term loan. During the quarter, we sold approximately 3.9 million shares with an aggregate value of $135 million after fees under our ATM program. All of the shares were sold subject to a forward sale agreement and as such are not reflected on our balance sheet. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.9 years to maturity. Turning to the income statement, as Ed mentioned, we doubled our GAAP revenue year-over-year, a feat we are very proud of and I want to thank the entire VICI team for all their efforts in delivering this growth. AFFO for the third quarter was approximately $471 million or $0.49 per share. Total AFFO in Q3 increased 83% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased 8.5% over the prior year. As a reminder, the disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count which increased primarily from the equity raised in shares issued to consummate our transformative acquisition of MGP during Q2 and our acquisition of the Venetian Resort during Q1 of this year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $12.1 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Turning to guidance, we are updating AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2022 is expected to be between $1.682 billion and $1.692 billion or between $1.91 and $1.92 per diluted common share. Our updated guidance reflects the uncapped CPI lease escalation of 8.1% that VICI will receive under our Las Vegas master lease and regional master lease with Caesars, effective for the lease year beginning on November 1, 2022. Additionally, the per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 15.3 million forward shares sold under our ATM program during Q2 and Q3. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other non-recurring transactions. As we have discussed in the past with you, we record a non-cash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO-focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Megan, please open the line for questions. Sure. Great, R.J., it's great talk to you. I mean one of the \u2013 we have this debate every day internally, right? When you see the 10-year moving 10, 15, 25 basis points, and obviously, the stock market is doing what it's doing, hard to price a deal on a daily basis. So we look at \u2013 but we do look at the spread to our cost of capital. And right now, look, we're getting 10-year pricing at 7%. So the $5 billion that we raised back in April, 5%, net adjusted at 4.5% with our hedge portfolio looks really, really good. But R.J., we're going to always maintain the spread to our cost of capital. Obviously, our stock has held up well. Debt pricing is what it is. As Ed just touched on, we have $1.3 billion of liquidity that is on the balance sheet, which does not include the term loan or the revolver. Being cognizant that cash is not free and that there is an implicit cost of that cash, we are going to ensure that we continue to do the deals that we've done in the past, maintaining that spread. And your comment around kind of middle of the fairway deals, I think you'll see more of the Rocky Gaps of the world were a little bit smaller deals and some of the large mega deals will probably take a pause for a while just given the uncertainty around kind of where the world is ultimately going. But we feel good about our pipeline. I think it's busier than it's ever been, and the dialogue is greater than it's ever been but we've got to be relentless in ensuring that we can continue to deliver consistent accretion year in and year out for our shareholders. It's a good question, Carlo. Good to speak to you. I hope you're well. Look, the current rate environment is it bounces around every day. And so we've got to run the business taking a long-term view, but being mindful of if we had to price something or if we had to close on something today or in the near-term, how that would impact ultimately accretion, right? We've got to drive accretive deals and be disciplined in what we've done since day 1. So it's something we watch. We've got access to the revolver. We've got access to the late draw term loan. Thankfully, we have no maturities until 2024, where we have to go to the debt markets, but it's something that we're going to be monitoring and making sure that we continue to drive growth to the balance sheet \u2013 through the balance sheet and can maintain the balance sheet and position of strength and as you said, bringing down leverage over time through potentially funding deals with our free cash flow. Yes, Rich. Great to talk to you. The one thing that we like about these loan investments as it gives us a seat at the table. It gives us insight to the business. It gives us exposure to the operator and as you have seen with Cabot and Canyon a path to real estate ownership. And so things like the Great Wolf where we \u2013 our attachment point, as I said, is 75% LTC. I think your question is, would we be willing to go higher or potentially even provide a senior portion we would if it's the right operator, the right sponsor and the right relationship and again, the overall cost of capital \u2013 return on that capital is commensurate with our capital. And I think the one thing to point out is, I know we refer to these as development, but they really build to suits and broader real estate parlance. And VICI is not doing the developing. We're partnered with high, high-quality developers set GMP contracts and oversight by very, very experienced builders. So while our development pipeline is robust, I think you could potentially see it deviate, meaning we could go lower in the Captec or even higher depending on what happens with the credit markets and making sure that we are rewarded for that. Yes. Todd, good to talk to you. I mean I think the implicit conversation was \u2013 or your question, excuse me, was are we shutting down our pipeline or are we pulling back. I mean I would tell you, we are busier than we have ever been as you saw on June 1st, we added a CIO, Kellan Florio from Goldman Sachs, who were thrilled about and is focused on opening more doors in the non-gaming world and has been very, very active. And so we constantly look at opportunities. But ultimately, if the opportunity doesn't make sense or the market backs up or there is a change, we will not pursue a deal that is not accretive, right. The minute we do a bad deal, that will be our last deal we do because we will not be able to raise capital going forward from our owners, our investors, both on the equity and the credit side. And we are living in a time that's pretty unique. Obviously, this sort of interest rate environment has not been around for many, many years, as Ed highlighted in his remarks and some of the charts that we have seen. But we will continue to be focused on raising liquidity like we did in June and August on the ATM, where we cut a little bit of tailwind in the equity markets and bolstered our balance sheet. But in terms of our intentions going forward, I can't talk about that. And we will see what tomorrow brings. But I think we have set up a balance sheet, we have set up a cost of capital that still can be competitive in this environment, but we are just going to be even more disciplined than we have in the past. Yes. I mean Todd, that's when it comes down to it. And I know that's hard to understand in order to put in your report, but relationships matter. You have heard John talk about it for years, if you see the clip that Ed referred to with John Goff and Jim Cramer and Ed on CNBC. He was very bullish about the opportunity to do more together. These are relationships that we foster and build and spend time with when we did Chelsea Piers back in June of 2020, it was competitive. It was a bid process. But part of our ability to win that was. One, our long-term view, we are not a fund driven. We don't have a fund life. And ultimately, our relationships mean a lot. And it's how you treat as Ed mentioned with respect to our advisors, we treat our counterparties extremely, extremely well because we want to do more together. We want both sides of the table to win and feel good and come back to the table to do more together in the future. Yes. Greg. Good to talk to you. It was in my remarks, it's 8.1%."

Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha and good morning, everyone. Q2, 2022 was a quintessentially VICI quarter. A lot happened, a lot of continuing transformation as we worked to build VICI into one of America's highest quality and larger scale REIT. Here's a quick recital of Q2's highlights. IG, in late April VICI was elevated to investment grade credit status by S&P and Fitch, IG fundraise. In late April, we conducted our inaugural investment grade debt raise and that $5 billion raise was the largest debut and largest single IG debt raise by any REIT in history. It was a debt raise conducted in conjunction with the funding of our MGP acquisition that proved the continuing energy and agility of David Kieske and the VICI finance team. As the treasury swaps and locks that David and the team had put in place in late 2021 and early 2022, significantly reduced the net coupon of net debt. MGP closure. In late April, we closed on our acquisition of the real estate of 15 MGM assets, magnificent examples of Class A real estate, thereby adding about $1 billion of new portfolio income and initiating our new partnership with MGM, a partnership we believe can grow substantially in the years ahead. S&P 500 inclusion. In early June, VQ was added to the S&P 500 making VICI the first American REIT in history to go from IPO to S&P 500 inclusion in less than five years. Pilgrimage experiences. In June with Cabot Citrus Farms near Tampa, we announced what we believe will be the first of many capital and property partnerships with Cabot, a global leader in creating and operating pilgrimage resort golf experiences. Our third tribal nation partnership. In June, we also announced that Cherokee Nation entertainment gaming holdings will become in due course our new operating partner in Gold Strike in Tunica, giving us yet another dynamic partner to grow with. These accomplishments significantly strengthen VICI's growth resources, capabilities, and opportunities, but there's one other key Q2 accomplishment. And that accomplishment is the growth of our VICI leadership team. In early June, we added two very talented senior officers. Kellan Florio became our new Chief Investment Officer, Moira Mccloskey became our new Vice President, Capital Markets. Kellan significantly adds to our ability to grow VICI's relationships and transactional activity with asset controllers, especially across, excuse me, especially across non-gaming sectors and Moira significantly strengthens our ability to further develop and sustain our relationships with capital providers, both equity and credit. Additionally, in June, we established the VICI management committee to continue to broaden and deepen VICI strategic resources and reach. This committee of seven includes Gabe Wasserman, Jerry -- Jeremy Waxman, Danny Valoy, Elena Keil, Cameron Lewis, Kellan Florio, and Mario Mccloskey. The VICI management committee working with John, David, Samantha and me will play an integral role in developing and moreover ensuring the execution of VICI's cultural ESG portfolio and total return goals and strategies in the years to come. They will be integral to the development of our growth ideas and our growth relationships, and from the growth of our ideas and our relationships will come the creation of stakeholder value. In a moment, John will tell you more about our current growth activities, and David will talk about our financial results and our financial outlook. But first, let me say a few words about our current strategic outlook. As you will hear further from John, our operating partners are delivering outstanding operating results, especially along Las Vegas Strip, where we gather about 45% of our portfolio income, but you wouldn't know this from how the equity and debt of our public listed partners are trading right now. Granted trading values tend to be based on outlook rather than current performance and both the sell and the buy sides are understandably concerned about a possible recession in the quarters ahead. But let me offer these three points. Point number one, gaming consumer resiliency. As we have discussed in the past, the gaming customer has proven to be more resilient through both garden variety recessions, and full blown crises than just about any other discretionary consumer out there, that was proven through both the great financial crisis and throughout the COVID19 pandemic. Point number two. Gaming operator resiliency. A couple of you on the sell side have produced well reasoned analysis that show the gaming operators generally, and many of our partners specifically will be in very solid shapes in terms of both free cash flow and balance sheet strength, even under fairly draconian recession scenarios in the year or so ahead. Our operators are responsible -- responsive, and agile in dealing with changing conditions. Both gaming consumer and gaming operator resiliency give VICI confidence in our belief that a possible recession will not harm the credit quality of our operators. But in the meantime, and this brings me to my third point. There is absolutely no question that the relative attractiveness of VICI's capital to both our current and potential operating partners in both gaming and non-gaming has only strengthened in the last few months. With our investment grade credit status and our S&P 500 inclusion, VICI's access to and cost of capital has strengthened on a relative basis at a time when most experiential operators have seen their access to capital severely curtailed and the cost of any incremental capital significantly increased. As we've proved with our Venetian acquisition, VICI has the capability to move quickly and decisively in market conditions that may cause others to pause. Current and especially prospective market conditions could yield VICI, we believe highly attractive growth opportunities in the quarters ahead. And further the topic of growth, I'll now turn the call over to John Payne. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of MGP, expanding our portfolio to 43 of the highest quality experiential real estate assets under our triple-net model with a combined 58,000 hotel rooms, hundreds of food and beverage and entertainment outlets, and millions of square feet of high-quality meeting and convention areas. Thanks to the tireless work of team VICI. We've completed over $29 billion of transactions since our company's formation, less than five years ago. We're very proud of these accomplishments. And at the same time, we're excited that our work has only just started. One of our primary objective that a company is to work with our existing tenants to provide capital solutions that help meet each operator's strategic objectives. As many of you have heard me say before, our team does not take a break after announcing or completing an acquisition. Our development team remains very active, expanding our relationships and sourcing opportunities that we believe will continue yielding accretive outcomes for VICI. During the second quarter, we entered in a long-term partnership with Cabot, a leading destination golf operator, where we provide funding for the redevelopment of Cabot Citrus Farms in Florida, and convert a portion of our loan to real estate ownership under a long-term sale lease back. We're very excited about this relationship and will look to potentially expand with Cabot over the coming years. While many of you enjoy asking questions about on the ground operating trends, I would like to remind you that we are a triple-net lease landlord. We collect fixed rent streams with annual escalations over very long periods of time. Those who have followed our story will recall that we continued to collect 100% of cash rent when every one of our properties was forced to close due to the government mandated restrictions in response to COVID-19. There have been many questions about the outlook for consumer spending. And I would simply repeat that our income does not fluctuate based on monthly or quarterly trends. Now, with that said in Las Vegas, the Strip continues to produce incredibly strong numbers. For example, gross gaming revenue in May was 41% above 2019 levels. And Harry Reid International Airport just registered an all-time record for passenger traffic this past June. While the growth rates are becoming more difficult to surpass given the record activity levels, the gaming industry has proven its resilience over decades. And anyone who researches operator profitability will understand that the business models are leaner and more flexible today as compared to pre-COVID years. The gaming operator successfully navigated a very uncertain period at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and emerged on stronger footing with record breaking margin expansion as they've created ways to monitor consumer activity and adjust their cost structures accordingly. We are very proud of our track record to date and our relationships with stable, industry-leading tenants. We will remain disciplined as we evaluate opportunities and ensure future acquisitions satisfy our investment criteria. Thanks to our exceptional balance sheet, which David will touch on, we believe we're in a very strong position as we evaluate growth opportunities. In an environment where cost of capital fluctuates daily, we will continue to pursue transactions with appropriate underwriting and accretion for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks John. I want to start with our balance sheet and overall liquidity available to VICI to fund future growth. To recap the second quarter events. On April 18th, VICI was upgraded to investment grade by S&P and Fitch, greatly broadening our access to permanent debt capital. On April 20th, we priced $5 billion of investment grade senior unsecured notes, executing the largest REIT investment grade bond offering ever. The blended cash interest rate for the notes was 5%, while the effective interest rate after taking into account our $3 billion hedge portfolio was 4.51%. On April 29th, we closed down the acquisition of MGP as well as the $5 billion bond offering. We used 4.4 billion of the proceeds to fund our redemption of a majority of MGM's MGP OP units. The remaining proceeds plus cash on hand were used to repay the outstanding balance on a revolving credit facility. The company also issued approximately $4.1 billion of aggregate principle amount of senior notes in exchange for and with the same interest rate, maturity date and redemption terms as notes originally issued by MGP pursuant to the settlement of the exchange offers and consent solicitations. Following the settlement of the exchange offers and consent solicitations, approximately 90 million of original MGP notes remain outstanding. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with a total -- with total debt of $15.5 billion inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction is approximately 5.8 times. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.38% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 7.2 years to maturity. We have had many accomplishments in our short existence as a public company, but being added to the S&P 500 index on June 8th is a continued endorsement of our growth. As mentioned, VICI was the fastest REIT to be added to the S&P 500 index from IPO to inclusion. And we believe being added to the index will broaden our investor base and improve our access to equity capital. During the quarter we sold approximately at 11.4 million shares with an aggregate value of $367.4 million before fees under our ATM program. All of the shares were sold subject to a forward sale agreement, and as such are not reflected on our balance sheet. As of June 30th, with approximately $4.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $614 million in cash and cash equivalence, $360 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our forward sale agreement, $2.5 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw facility. In July, the revolving credit facility was amended to permit borrowings in certain foreign currencies up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1.25 billion enhancing our financial flexibility. Turning to the income statement. AFFO for the second quarter was $430.1 million or $0.48 per share. Total AFFO in Q2 increased 67.9% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 4% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raised and shares issued to consummate our transformative acquisition of MGP. At the end of Q2, the company has approximately 963 million shares of common stock outstanding and VICI OP has 12.2 million additional OP units outstanding held by MGM, which were received in the merger. A full reconciliation of the share count is included in our earnings release. Our results, once again, highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in a high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $11.8 million for the quarter. And as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.8%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. We believe this represents the appropriate go-forward run rate when accounting for the increase in certain expenses related to the MGP acquisition I just want to touch on CECL or current expected credit losses, out of the $552 million non-cash charge we incurred in Q2, 80% or approximately $443 million was related to the initial allowance we were required to record upon entering into the MGM master lease. This allowance did reduce our GAAP net income for the quarter, but as previously noted non-cash CECL charges do not impact cash flow or AFFO. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars, as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other non-recurring transactions. The per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 11.4 million forward shares sold from our ATM program in Q2. And as we have discussed, we recorded non-cash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and AFFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. AFFO for the year ending December 31st, 2022 is expected to be between $1.66 billion and $1.69 billion, or between $1.89 and $1.92 per diluted common share. With that operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question on the phone lines from Anthony Paolone of JP Morgan. Please go ahead when you're ready, Anthony.\nAnthony Paolone: Great. Thank you and good morning. My first question relates to your efforts outside of gaming. So, you have four of these experiential relationships going, can you comment on where you -- when we might see some of these convert into straight up property acquisitions and also do you see more of these, or these growing over the next 12 to 18 months?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. Tony, good to talk to you and I'll start out. This is Ed. And before I answer that question, I hope I don't preclude a second question you may be asking. I want to thank you for doing the math that you did in your note last night regarding the potential impact of CPI on VICI's run roll. To answer your question, I think, Cabot, the Cabot transaction is representative of the sort of transaction we wish to duplicate in many, if not all of our non-gaming transactions, insofar as the Cabot transaction is predicated on a period of lending into development with the lent capital converting into real estate capital upon stabilization of the development, that will obviously apply in situations where there is development. In other situations, we will obviously look for opportunities where we have the opportunity to own real property right out of the gate. But we're taking an approach in non-gaming that often requires pioneering. Insofar as one of the fundamental opportunities we believe we have at VICI is to pioneer the OPCO/PROPCO structure into experiential white space that has not seen the OPCO/PROPCO structure before. And in order to do that, and we're very happily doing it, we're willing to create structures like we did with Cabot.\nAnthony Paolone: Got it. Okay. And then, with regards to the equity raise in the quarter off the ATM, any comments on the planned usage there, or how should we think about doing it or, why you did it?\nDavid Kieske: Hey, Tony, it's David. Good to talk to you. It's really an opportunistic use of the ATM. And as I mentioned, we put it under the forward agreement. So, with the inclusion in the S&P 500 index, we saw elevated volumes in a level and a priced -- share price that we thought made sense to raise a little equity just for the -- given the current state of the environment and enhance our overall liquidity.\nEdward Pitoniak: And I think you can take it, Tony, as a sign of our confidence that we're going to have opportunities to deploy capital.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thanks Tony.\nOperator: Thank you, Tony. We now have the next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead when you are ready.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Ed, I'm wanted to circle back to your comments. You talked about sort of the downturn and obviously that doesn't really affect you, but it does affect the operators. And I'm just wondering if a pending recession or weakening fundamentals might actually spur more transactions in the near-term. And then I do have a second question. Thank you.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. Steve, good to talk to you. The -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, what we do not fear is a recession having a harmful effect on our operators operating results and their overall credit quality. But I think one thing to be sober about is, the outlook for refinancing in 2023, 2024, and potentially even beyond, but especially in those two years. And one of the data collections I read most avidly every Monday is the credit trading data of our existing and potential partners. And when you look at the yields to worst of a lot of -- a lot of the experiential credit, both gaming, and non- gaming, you're looking at yields to worst right now that if they had to refinance at those levels, and then compare the cost of that refinancing to the cost of our capital through sale lease back structures, we can, frankly, in many cases, beat the hell out of that. So, I think, we do see it. I think, implicit in your questions, Steve, we agree with your implicit suggestion that there could be very attractive opportunities to, for us to support very strong operators who nonetheless could suffer from a refinancing marketplace over the next couple of years, that makes our capital that much more attractive.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. And then the second one, maybe sort of along the lines of development, I know when -- we were talking over the last few weeks, densification opportunities along the Strip are opportunities. And sort of similar, we talked about the non-gaming and Cabot and doing lending into development, would you use a similar structure for opportunities on the Strip, or would you just wind up, you think purchasing those upon completion?\nEdward Pitoniak: I think it would depend on the circumstances, Steve. But just to make sure everybody understands that the basis of your question, we are very excited about the densification and intensification opportunities that we and our partners have along this Strip. We have 660 acres all told, and in due course, we're going to be mapping those 660 acres to identify either unoccupied acreage, or acreage that is otherwise not being put to its highest and best use. And we think we have the opportunity to support our partners in the intensification efforts in ways that could lead to billions of dollars of incremental investment opportunities. In terms of how we would structure the capital in those opportunities, where the opportunity is there to lend and then convert to real estate ownership, we might do so. But in many of the properties we already own, it could simply be a case where we are. We are financing the development of the real estate with our capital and effectively owning the real estate as it gets built, if you will.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from RJ Milligan of Raymond James. You may proceed with your question, RJ.\nRJ Milligan: Yeah. Good morning, guys. So, security and investment grade rating, plenty of liquidity, stock is now trading near an all-time high. So, despite the macro uncertainty and volatility, it seems like the market's giving VICI the green light for growth. So, do you think it's time to get more aggressive on the acquisition front even more than you already have been? And why not call the Caesars assets now and lock-in pretty attractive accretion?\nEdward Pitoniak: I'll turn it over to John, but the idea that we would exceed the velocity. We've transpired -- that's transpired so far $29 billion in a little over four years. That's a pretty strong pace, but I'm going to turn it over to John for his thoughts on potentially taking advantage of both our current cost of capital and market conditions. John?\nJohn Payne: Yeah. RJ, good morning. You're giving me a heart attack already, RJ, for moving more than we've already -- more than we've already done. But look, RJ, I think your observations are good, but as good as we are doing right now, we need to continue to be disciplined in our approach to evaluating opportunities, and making sure we're meeting our investment criteria. I can assure you, and as Ed said in his opening marks, we've added resources to the development team. Not only our expertise in gaming, but we've added Kellan Florio as our Chief Investment Officer who is going to focus on non-gaming. So, more to come here, but we hear you and we're out there, turning over every rock of opportunity.\nRJ Milligan: Thanks guys. And a follow-up question. And this is related to Steve's earlier question, but I wanted to focus more specifically on Caesars because we've gotten a lot of questions on Caesars and their balance sheet and sort of their plans. And obviously, the coming rent increases are positive for VICI, right? Given that it boosts your internal growth above most of the peers in the net lease space, but it also stretches coverage. And so, if you factor in a recession, maybe that stretches coverage as well. So, I'm just curious how you feel about Caesars right now, the current and future coverage levels? And then, specifically, and this leads to Steve's question about potential transactions with them in the future.\nEdward Pitoniak: John, do want to start?\nJohn Payne: Look, we feel great about Caesars, under the leadership of Tom Reeg. As you all know, we helped support them when they were El Dorado taking over the company. They had a business plan in place and they've executed it in a very disciplined way on the bricks and mortar facilities. Would we continue to do -- find opportunities to work together? We hope so. We hope that they continue to perform well, and we find opportunities to help them grow their facilities. And they've been very good partners to us, and I hope they feel that we've been good partners to them.\nRJ Milligan: Thank You, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We now have a question from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. Morning. I wanted to ask just kind of specifically about the billion dollars of funding commitments that you mentioned in your Q, that's coming from the property growth fund. And just given, more recessionary concerns, do you feel like your existing tenants may be more likely to kind of pull back on those funding commitments, because it's -- I guess it's initiated from their end, correct? And I'm just wondering if you have a sense that maybe the -- their appetite for investing maybe slowing a little bit, just given maybe the need to hoard capital, if you will. There's any kind of thoughts around that.\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Well, I'm going to kind of -- sound like I'm repeating myself here, but Smedes, it's nice to talk to you this morning. I mean, if you look at Las Vegas right now, Smedes, just where there could be a lot of this capital deployed, in my opening remarks I talked about the growth in Las Vegas. In May, it was 41%. GGR up over 2019 and then the June numbers came out this morning and in June grew 23% year-over-year. So, again, we have to be aware of the macro conditions going on, but there are some markets such as Las Vegas that are seeing tremendous growth. The consumer continues to visit. In my opening remarks I talked about the record number of passengers declining in Las Vegas in the month of June. And so, if you are an operator and you have a facility in Las Vegas, you can see it is a town that is growing and there could be opportunities to deploy capital creatively. And as Ed mentioned in his remarks as well, or in his comments about Las Vegas, it is a town that we have 660 acres and we'd love to continue to grow there.\nSmedes Rose: Okay.\nEdward Pitoniak: The other thing I would add, Smedes -- the other thing I would add, Smedes, is that, we could be -- it remains to be seen that the velocity of which this will rollover. But we're -- you're beginning to see -- beginning to see the beginnings of rollover instruction costs. And I think, if we continue to see a more benign construction cost environment, it could obviously create a stronger green light for development.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then, David, I just wanted to ask you, on the ATM, I mean, it looks like the growth raise was close to $374 million and the net was $360 million. That seems like a particularly high kind of fee. And I'm just wondering, is that typical, or was there something specific maybe to that?\nDavid Kieske: The gross was $360 million 7.04? Sorry Smedes. The gross number was $367.4 million and the net was $360 million. So, these were market fees.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Gotcha. Thank you.\nOperator: We now have the next question from Neil Malkin of Capital One Securities. Your line is open, Neil.\nNeil Malkin: Hey, everyone. Thank you. Relative to the time, David, I'm still waiting for those VICI raises. So, we can talk off line about my address for [indiscernible] Kellan, I don't know if he's done that. I don't know if he's on the call. But obviously you brought him over to focus on non-gaming. I'm just wondering, maybe this is just a broader general question. You can take it however you want. What does he see, I guess, in terms, what do you guys see as the biggest opportunity, the biggest untapped segment, that has the most potential to be executed on over the next 12 to 24 months. I know you talked about pioneering and you guys have definitely done that on the different parts of the capital stack, for sure. But I'd be really interested to get some insight from you or from your conversations with Kellan and particularly again with a very strong stock price.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. Kellan Florio is not on the call. So, John will answer this for you, Neil.\nJohn Payne: Yeah. Neil. Good morning. It's good to talk to you. I don't know if I have a specific category you've heard us talk about, we love the indoor water park business, the theme park business, family entertainment centers. There's parts of sports that I think are quite interesting that we're studying and parts of fitness that we're continuing to study. And as you mentioned, we're really pioneering some areas here that have not traditionally worked with a REIT. And so, we're working on different structures as Ed talked earlier in his comments that will eventually turn into real estate ownership. So I don't have a specific area, but it is nice to have an additional resource, because it's clearly and Kellan short time being with us, a little over eight weeks, our funnel has gotten a lot wider and we have the -- we've had the opportunity to talk to more companies domestically and internationally.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe Ed or John, I don't know, but other follow up question would be along the same vein is, when you do these exercises, looking at new types of business models to put a triple-net structure on top of, can you just quickly like outline or -- how do you think about the risk, and how do you adjust, protect yourself from like unknown risks, because it's a new industry? How do you think about alternative uses replacement costs? All of those things that obviously offer downside protection, if something unexpected happens to that segment.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. So Neil, we use four fundamental evaluation factors when we look at any experiential category. Starting with lower than average cyclicality versus consumer discretionary at large, we -- what we really love about gaming is it does have lower cyclicality, and we generally want a trend toward segments that have that same characteristic. Number two, we want healthy supply demand balance. This usually means investing capital in assets that have a cost or complexity that tends to mitigate against unwarranted supply. We do not want -- number three, we do not want secular threat to be a big factor. We generally want the real estate to provide an out of home experience. That must almost by definition, be an out of home experience, and thus be less vulnerable to, as we say, getting Amazon by displacing the experience through putting it at a box or shipping it through a wire to your house. And then finally, number four, we want proven durability of the end user experience. Because the durability of the end user experience that constitutes the durability of the operator's business and it's the durability of the operator's business and ultimately constitutes the durability of our rent.\nNeil Malkin: Okay. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Neil. Yeah. Next question operator.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question from Wes Golladay from Baird. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nWesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just have a question on the VICI property growth fund. How should we think about the trajectory of deploying capital? Will you expect to deploy capital in 2023 and will it ramp up 2024, 2025? And then, do you have a max exposure for the segment?\nDavid Kieske: Wes, this is David. Good to talk to you. I mean, I missed a little tail end of that, but let try to just address \u2026\nWesley Golladay: Max exposure.\nDavid Kieske: Max. Thank you. So, well, it depends on the project. We are actively working with all of our tenants. They understand that, that we have the partner property growth fund and that we have the ability to invest into their assets, as we talked about on this call and this serves as an attractive source of funding for our tenants. So somewhat depends on the project. The Venetian, for example, we committed a billion dollar to the partner property growth fund, and that billion dollars could go into the -- or the continuation of the funding of the hotel that was stopped in 2008. It could go into some other expansion ideas and renovation ideas that the Apollo team has. And we hope that some of that may start later this year, but it's again, all up to our tenants and their timing. And then in terms of the deployment of that, the nice thing about the partner property growth fund, it's important that does not come all at once. If it's a new hotel tower or we take the Mirage where Hard Rock coming in and we've committed up to $1.5 billion, if they so choose to use that money, that's a 12, 18, 24-month redevelopment timeline where we get to -- going to deploy that capital on a monthly basis, not having to go to the market to raise large amounts of capital day one. So, it's a flow business for VICI, and attractive funding source for VICI. In terms of max size, that's -- we want to be cognizant of the development risk. At the end of the day, we are not the developer, but our capital obviously is going into projects that are being developed. And it'll depend on where that capital is, whether it's in gaming, non-gaming, if it's on the Strip or if it's regional. So, we're going to be cognizant of the total size, but right now I don't have a threshold for you. But we're going to -- we're excited to use it. We're excited to help our tenants grow.\nEdward Pitoniak: Wes, let me just add. I'm sitting here with a team in our -- one of our New York conference rooms, and I'm looking at beautiful big aerial photos of a couple of our Las Vegas assets, Caesars Palace, and the Venetian. And I think one of the things we're starting to realize Wes -- and is that we need to do a better job of communicating the nature of the real estate we own, especially along Las Vegas Strip. And that when we describe it when we, or anyone else describes it as gaming real estate, we are not accurately describing it. As I look here at the Venetian, I'm looking at a complex of nearly 13 million square feet on what are we, 80, 90 acres, and gaming occupies, I think, less than about 2% of the square footage of that asset, right? And so, if you want to think about our Las Vegas assets and come up with a corollary, real estate corollary to our Las Vegas assets, I would encourage you to think of the correlate of being theme parks, right, because of the mass, the mass size complexity, layout, and development potential of these assets. And this is true of all -- 10 assets we own along the Strip or -- more true at some than others, but very true of many of them. And as an example, the Venetian -- and the photo I'm looking at, you can't even see where the MSG Sphere will go. And it represents a densification of the real estate that I think is among the most exciting development's going on in global entertainment right now. And for new music fans out there, it was just announced this last week that U2 will have the opening residency at the MSG Sphere when it opens in 2023. So, we hope in time for F1. Sorry, I got a little over excited there, Wes.\nWesley Golladay: Yes, Ed. You remind me F1. I'm looking forward to that as well. A real quick, speaking of sports, would VICI ever consider doing stadiums? I mean, company obviously has massive scale. Not anyone can do those. And it just seems like maybe an untapped market for you.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. So stadiums, stadiums are intriguing. But I do think we are mindful of the fact of obsolescence risk in stadiums. For every Fenway Park or Wrigley Field or Anfield or Old Trafford, there's a stadium that had proved to have about 20 years of useful life. And then -- and Atlanta, the Atlanta baseball stadium situations, an example. I will tell you that one area of pro sports globally that we're very interested in is the whole dimension of training facilities. And as you know, Wes, that's become a bigger beginning area focus of investment for pro sports teams. And we've been having discussions and doing a lot of study around being a virtuous capital provider as global sport obviously becomes more and more a focus of capital provision.\nWesley Golladay: Great. Thanks for the time everyone.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Wes.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Barry Jonas from Truist Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nBarry Jonas: Thank you for that introduction. What percentage of the portfolio would you guys like to see non-gaming longer term?\nEdward Pitoniak: John, do you want to do that?\nJohn Payne: Yeah. Barry, it's good to talk to. I don't think we have a specific number. I think we've been clear that the magnitude of gaming assets and the magnitude of EBITDA that they generate are significantly higher than what we've seen in the non-gaming space. So, we may end up doing more non-gaming transactions, but they may not add up to the quantity of rent, so to speak of just one or two gaming assets. So, we're continuing to work on this. You can hear me talk and you can hear Ed talk, hear David talk in our remarks that we are spending more time in a variety of areas in the experiential space. But we don't have a specific number today of how large that will be or what percentage will be of our total portfolio. But I think as we refine this over the coming years under Kellan's leadership, we'll have a better idea of the segments of business that we'll go into and how big they can be.\nEdward Pitoniak: The other thing, I just want to make sure, Barry, no one ever loses track of or sight of is that we are as excited about global gaming investment as we have ever been. And we believe our opportunities to continue to grow in American gaming and in international gaming -- represents our most exciting, compelling, large scale growth opportunity, but just want to make sure that does not get lost.\nBarry Jonas: That's great. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up question. You've certainly highlighted the resilience of gaming on this call and in the past. But given the macro uncertainty out there, how does that impact -- how you guys think about transactions and credit quality now, especially as you're evaluating new OPCOs?\nDavid Kieske: Barry, it's David. Good to talk to you. As Ed alluded to, and as we talked about a lot, right, the gaming customer will always game. And one of the things that's going on in our underwriting more specifically is obviously there's been a ramp up in EBITDAR over the last -- post COVID. EBITDAR is much greater than it was in 2019 and before. And so one of the things that we're working with, anything we evaluate is what is the true run rate? What is -- where does the margin settle out? And I think, we're all comfortable that EBITDAR is going to be greater than 2019, but is it really going to be double or triple, or is it more, one in three quarters times or two times. And so, we're spending a lot of time with the operators on their belief of the future -- the market, and it all depends on the market, the asset and the opportunity. And in terms of credit quality, that's of us -- a big focus of us and with our master leases, our corporate guarantees and knowing the operators, the way that John and Danny and team know the operators we're able to underwrite the overall opportunity. And we talked about the acquisition environment. We continue to believe our ability to put points on the board here as we go forward.\nEdward Pitoniak: Hey, Barry, let me just add. The -- I think there's another dimension to this, that also speaks to the opportunity for gaming operators to continue to grow their competitiveness and consumer discretionary, and that relates to sports betting. And I feel like sports betting in the last, I don't know, six, nine months Barry, it feels like the dot com explosion, right, of the early 2000s when every baby got thrown out with the bath water. Right? And if in 2000 you said, okay, dot com blew up. I'm never going to own Amazon again. You just -- you don't even want to think about the value you missed out on. Right? And I think one of the things that's being missed here is that the gaming operators have made investments in increasing their bandwidth, increasing the bandwidth with which they can reach, activate, engage, and generate business from a much bigger, deeper consumer market in America. And I think we're going to see the benefits of that in the years to come, especially by the way, in which gaming, sorry, sports betting has enabled the gaming operators to activate the next-generation of customers. Again, I think the whole kind of cloud over the sports betting investments is, is really gone too far. And people are losing sight of the fact that it is going to be a key, key means by which gaming competes in the American consumer marketplace.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Great. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have David Katz of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Ed, earlier on, I think I forget exactly how you phrased it, but in reference to Cabot, you talked about the possibility or the expectation that that is a relationship that continues to grow and broaden over time. Would you mind coloring that in just a bit? Cabot is somewhat new on our consciousness for those of us that aren't pilgrimage, golfers.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. David, good to hear from you. I'm going to ask my colleague and partner, Samantha to offer her thoughts here, because she was our business leader on developing and creating our Cabot partnership. So Samantha?\nSamantha Gallagher: Yeah. Thanks Ed. So, we are very excited about this partnership. And as -- if to the extent you have followed Cabot, they have opportunities and growth opportunities internationally beyond just the United States that we certainly would look at with them. If there's -- they've an asset in St. Lucia, they've just announced an asset in Scotland. And so, we think there's growth opportunities together there. And one of the things we love about what we've done with this transaction is we've created a template that we can really follow. So, as we discussed earlier on the call, this loan, because it is development, but it does convert into real estate ownership and we have the documentation already in place for that. So, we're excited to use that template to grow with them.\nDavid Katz: So if I -- as my follow-up, you noted that there are two that are underway, is it fair to assume that they Cabot have a vision for, what eight, 10 long-term, and you would walk along that journey where it makes sense?\nSamantha Gallagher: Well, I think they have great expansion and growth opportunities. I can't speak for how many, but certainly we would love to walk along that journey together. And we've developed a really strong partnership. This was a relationship that we've been working on for at least 18 months before we signed the deal. So, this is now a very strong relationship between our two teams and we look forward to growing together.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. David, I would encourage you and everybody else, they're just beginning to get to know who Cabot is, to go to their -- and I can't remember the corporate website for Cabot. Do you remember the address?\nSamantha Gallagher: It should be Cabot links.com, but.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. And anyway, David, as you well know, having covered the depth and breadth of hospitality and recreation that you do, so much of the scalability of a business in leisure hospitality, recreation is based upon the scalability of the management team. And one of the things I think you'll be very impressed by is the caliber of the management team that Ben Cowan-Dewar, the founder of Cabot, has put together. Because that is the limiting factor, right? That is the biggest constraint for organizations like this in terms of the scalability of their portfolio, is the scalability of their management team. And they have built an outstanding management team, as you will see when you look at their website, which is \u2026\nSamantha Gallagher: It's the cabotcollection.com.\nDavid Katz: Got it. Okay. I have probably five more, but I'm not allowed and I'll circle back. Thanks.\nEdward Pitoniak: Give us a call, David. Give us a call.\nOperator: Thank you. You now have Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead when you're ready, Ronald.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Just two quick ones for me. The first is following up on the non-gaming opportunities. Did a good job, giving us some examples of the verticals. But when you sort of put it all together in your mind, just how -- just broad strokes, how big do you think that TAM is as you guys are attacking that opportunity?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. Ronald, it's a question we're working on. The thing we would most emphasize is this would be global TAM. These are categories of leisure, entertainment, recreation, that we see investing in on a global basis. And we are only at the beginnings of determining what that TAM would be. But I think you can be confident that when looked at globally, it represents a very big universe of potential investment.\nJohn Payne: And Ronald, I'll just add that. If you had asked us this question last quarter, we've probably added two or three other categories that we're now studying. So, the TAM is going to continue to, to ebb and flow as we continue to find new categories that our capital could be put to work.\nRonald Kamdem: Excellent. And then my quick follow-up would be, you talked a lot about sort of international opportunities, obviously add into the TAM. But as their markets that are closer than others, you provide more details there, is it Europe, specific country, so forth would be helpful. Thanks.\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yeah. We've been on the road for -- Kellan started, as I said, eight weeks ago in his first week, he was with me on a trip to Europe to look at numerous assets. We've spent some time in Canada as well. We like the country of Australia. So, we are out and about better understanding opportunities. Again, as Ed mentioned earlier, not only in non-gaming, but the opportunities in our core of gaming. So, we're active in these spaces right now and the funnel is just going to get wider as we've added more resources to our development team.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Spenser Allaway of Green Street. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. Maybe just staying on the international theme. I'm just curious if you guys look at the Crown Resort sale in Australia, and could there be a potential to JV with a partner like Blackstone to eat some of the tuition costs that come with expanding abroad.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. Good to hear from you, Spencer. John, you want to take that?\nJohn Payne: Yeah. Good to hear from you, Spencer. As you know, we never comment on specific deals that are out there, but I think you're asking us, are we aware of the Crown Resorts and do we like a market like Australia and would we partner with a company like Blackstone, which obviously we have in a couple different occasions in gaming and a non-gaming. So, the answer is, would we have interest in those areas? Absolutely. We think they're wonderful assets. We think that Blackstone is a great operator. But is there an opportunity for us today? I can't comment on that, but those are areas that we would've interest in.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Jay Kornreich from SMBC. Jay, your line is open.\nJay Kornreich: Hey, thank you. Good morning. As we look at gaming, you guys spend a lot of time during the first few years in the business, educating investors about gaming real estate. And at this point, I think generally everybody's a good understanding of the asset class and safety of flows. But as we now transition to the potential size of non-gaming, how do you guys kind of evaluate the opportunities to grow in that segment with the risk of investors needing time to digest and understand new asset classes and restarting that education process?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. It's a good question, Jay. And the responsibility lies with us to explain the nature of the business we're investing in, the nature of the operator's business model and the credit worthiness of the operator. And we realize -- we own that responsibility and we'll exercise it very diligently. Obviously, helping people understand the gaming story was good training for what we need to be able to do and what we're responsible for doing in non-gaming. I will say, I think there's a bit of a mitigant, a positive mitigant at work, Jay, insofar yes, we have the obligation to help investors understand this new category, but with each new category, assuming we can convince them quickly that this is a category worthy of investment. It obviously also helps them answer the question, how does VICI continue to grow now that it's gotten so big? So, again, we won't shed the responsibility to educate, but we think with each new category we go in, we prove that there is a lot more we can do to continue to create value and growth at VICI.\nJay Kornreich: Okay. Understood. And then just as a follow-up with the potentials -- potential Caesars in Las Vegas sale, I know your product comment on that. But just in terms of the current marketplace with interest rates where they are, how do you guys kind of assess your willingness and ability to acquire Las Vegas real estate in an accretive manner at this point?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. It obviously needs to be accretive, Jay, that's absolutely the requirement. And I think that we're in a very interesting period right now. It's a period in which some people realize, it's not 2021 anymore, and other people haven't quite figured out it's not 2021 anymore. What I would say is that the marketplace of borrowers or those who need capital, has more quickly figured out that the world has changed. And with it, the pricing that goes with that change, and then there's others -- potential sellers, some of whom haven't really figured out, it's not 2021 anymore. So, it's really going to be highly circumstantial as to whether or not there's the potential to get a deal done. And it will only get done based upon mutual recognition that the world has changed and prices need to change accordingly.\nJay Kornreich: Okay. Thanks very much.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from John Decree of CBRE Securities. Please go ahead when you're ready, John.\nJohn Decree: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my question and all the questions. Maybe I'd just piggyback on your last response there about how the world has changed and to revisit your earlier discussion on cost of debt, the yield to worst of your tenants and potential tenants. You've often get compared to debt capital, but your source of financing is typically more permanent than debt. And we've had a recent conversation about your partners and how they should consider their overall cost of capital, given the longevity of your financing. I'm wondering in this environment, if you've seen partners and perspective partners starting to compare your capital to their overall cost of capital, or are you still competing with just debt capital at this point, how has that kind of education process gone and has anything started to change given the current environment?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. So, John always good to talk to you. It's our responsibility to educate, whether it be existing partners or potential partners and we're doing the work, as we speak of making sure that they understand not only the nature of our capital, which you're absolutely right, John, it is permanent, but also the cost -- the comparative cost of it to their, exactly your point, to their weighted average cost of capital. If you take their current yields to worst on their benchmark bonds, and then take their implied cost of equity, most of our would be -- and existing partners are looking at weighted average cost of capital that tend to be in the 10%, 11% range, right? And needless to say with good quality assets under the right leases, we can beat the hell out of that cost at the right cap rate, a cap rate that's very accretive to us, but representing capital that is very attractively priced for them. And that's again against their weighted average cost to capital. As I alluded to earlier in the call, John, there are situations where their debt in some cases is trading so wide and probably unfairly wide that in there will be cases where we can even beat the cost of debt, never mind the way -- the blended cost of debt and equity.\nJohn Decree: That's a good point. Ed thanks. I appreciate the additional color on that.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand it back to Ed Pitoniak for some closing remarks.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yeah. Thank you, operator. And thanks to all of you. We're sorry to keep you a little long, but it's great to engage with all of you and we look forward very much to talking with you again next quarter. Bye for now.\nOperator: Thank you, all. That does conclude today's call. Thank you again for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha and good morning, everyone. Q2, 2022 was a quintessentially VICI quarter. A lot happened, a lot of continuing transformation as we worked to build VICI into one of America's highest quality and larger scale REIT. Here's a quick recital of Q2's highlights. IG, in late April VICI was elevated to investment grade credit status by S&P and Fitch, IG fundraise. In late April, we conducted our inaugural investment grade debt raise and that $5 billion raise was the largest debut and largest single IG debt raise by any REIT in history. It was a debt raise conducted in conjunction with the funding of our MGP acquisition that proved the continuing energy and agility of David Kieske and the VICI finance team. As the treasury swaps and locks that David and the team had put in place in late 2021 and early 2022, significantly reduced the net coupon of net debt. MGP closure. In late April, we closed on our acquisition of the real estate of 15 MGM assets, magnificent examples of Class A real estate, thereby adding about $1 billion of new portfolio income and initiating our new partnership with MGM, a partnership we believe can grow substantially in the years ahead. S&P 500 inclusion. In early June, VQ was added to the S&P 500 making VICI the first American REIT in history to go from IPO to S&P 500 inclusion in less than five years. Pilgrimage experiences. In June with Cabot Citrus Farms near Tampa, we announced what we believe will be the first of many capital and property partnerships with Cabot, a global leader in creating and operating pilgrimage resort golf experiences. Our third tribal nation partnership. In June, we also announced that Cherokee Nation entertainment gaming holdings will become in due course our new operating partner in Gold Strike in Tunica, giving us yet another dynamic partner to grow with. These accomplishments significantly strengthen VICI's growth resources, capabilities, and opportunities, but there's one other key Q2 accomplishment. And that accomplishment is the growth of our VICI leadership team. In early June, we added two very talented senior officers. Kellan Florio became our new Chief Investment Officer, Moira Mccloskey became our new Vice President, Capital Markets. Kellan significantly adds to our ability to grow VICI's relationships and transactional activity with asset controllers, especially across, excuse me, especially across non-gaming sectors and Moira significantly strengthens our ability to further develop and sustain our relationships with capital providers, both equity and credit. Additionally, in June, we established the VICI management committee to continue to broaden and deepen VICI strategic resources and reach. This committee of seven includes Gabe Wasserman, Jerry -- Jeremy Waxman, Danny Valoy, Elena Keil, Cameron Lewis, Kellan Florio, and Mario Mccloskey. The VICI management committee working with John, David, Samantha and me will play an integral role in developing and moreover ensuring the execution of VICI's cultural ESG portfolio and total return goals and strategies in the years to come. They will be integral to the development of our growth ideas and our growth relationships, and from the growth of our ideas and our relationships will come the creation of stakeholder value. In a moment, John will tell you more about our current growth activities, and David will talk about our financial results and our financial outlook. But first, let me say a few words about our current strategic outlook. As you will hear further from John, our operating partners are delivering outstanding operating results, especially along Las Vegas Strip, where we gather about 45% of our portfolio income, but you wouldn't know this from how the equity and debt of our public listed partners are trading right now. Granted trading values tend to be based on outlook rather than current performance and both the sell and the buy sides are understandably concerned about a possible recession in the quarters ahead. But let me offer these three points. Point number one, gaming consumer resiliency. As we have discussed in the past, the gaming customer has proven to be more resilient through both garden variety recessions, and full blown crises than just about any other discretionary consumer out there, that was proven through both the great financial crisis and throughout the COVID19 pandemic. Point number two. Gaming operator resiliency. A couple of you on the sell side have produced well reasoned analysis that show the gaming operators generally, and many of our partners specifically will be in very solid shapes in terms of both free cash flow and balance sheet strength, even under fairly draconian recession scenarios in the year or so ahead. Our operators are responsible -- responsive, and agile in dealing with changing conditions. Both gaming consumer and gaming operator resiliency give VICI confidence in our belief that a possible recession will not harm the credit quality of our operators. But in the meantime, and this brings me to my third point. There is absolutely no question that the relative attractiveness of VICI's capital to both our current and potential operating partners in both gaming and non-gaming has only strengthened in the last few months. With our investment grade credit status and our S&P 500 inclusion, VICI's access to and cost of capital has strengthened on a relative basis at a time when most experiential operators have seen their access to capital severely curtailed and the cost of any incremental capital significantly increased. As we've proved with our Venetian acquisition, VICI has the capability to move quickly and decisively in market conditions that may cause others to pause. Current and especially prospective market conditions could yield VICI, we believe highly attractive growth opportunities in the quarters ahead. And further the topic of growth, I'll now turn the call over to John Payne. John? Yeah. Tony, good to talk to you and I'll start out. This is Ed. And before I answer that question, I hope I don't preclude a second question you may be asking. I want to thank you for doing the math that you did in your note last night regarding the potential impact of CPI on VICI's run roll. To answer your question, I think, Cabot, the Cabot transaction is representative of the sort of transaction we wish to duplicate in many, if not all of our non-gaming transactions, insofar as the Cabot transaction is predicated on a period of lending into development with the lent capital converting into real estate capital upon stabilization of the development, that will obviously apply in situations where there is development. In other situations, we will obviously look for opportunities where we have the opportunity to own real property right out of the gate. But we're taking an approach in non-gaming that often requires pioneering. Insofar as one of the fundamental opportunities we believe we have at VICI is to pioneer the OPCO/PROPCO structure into experiential white space that has not seen the OPCO/PROPCO structure before. And in order to do that, and we're very happily doing it, we're willing to create structures like we did with Cabot. And I think you can take it, Tony, as a sign of our confidence that we're going to have opportunities to deploy capital. Thanks Tony. Yeah. Steve, good to talk to you. The -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, what we do not fear is a recession having a harmful effect on our operators operating results and their overall credit quality. But I think one thing to be sober about is, the outlook for refinancing in 2023, 2024, and potentially even beyond, but especially in those two years. And one of the data collections I read most avidly every Monday is the credit trading data of our existing and potential partners. And when you look at the yields to worst of a lot of -- a lot of the experiential credit, both gaming, and non- gaming, you're looking at yields to worst right now that if they had to refinance at those levels, and then compare the cost of that refinancing to the cost of our capital through sale lease back structures, we can, frankly, in many cases, beat the hell out of that. So, I think, we do see it. I think, implicit in your questions, Steve, we agree with your implicit suggestion that there could be very attractive opportunities to, for us to support very strong operators who nonetheless could suffer from a refinancing marketplace over the next couple of years, that makes our capital that much more attractive. I think it would depend on the circumstances, Steve. But just to make sure everybody understands that the basis of your question, we are very excited about the densification and intensification opportunities that we and our partners have along this Strip. We have 660 acres all told, and in due course, we're going to be mapping those 660 acres to identify either unoccupied acreage, or acreage that is otherwise not being put to its highest and best use. And we think we have the opportunity to support our partners in the intensification efforts in ways that could lead to billions of dollars of incremental investment opportunities. In terms of how we would structure the capital in those opportunities, where the opportunity is there to lend and then convert to real estate ownership, we might do so. But in many of the properties we already own, it could simply be a case where we are. We are financing the development of the real estate with our capital and effectively owning the real estate as it gets built, if you will. I'll turn it over to John, but the idea that we would exceed the velocity. We've transpired -- that's transpired so far $29 billion in a little over four years. That's a pretty strong pace, but I'm going to turn it over to John for his thoughts on potentially taking advantage of both our current cost of capital and market conditions. John? John, do want to start? John? The other thing I would add, Smedes -- the other thing I would add, Smedes, is that, we could be -- it remains to be seen that the velocity of which this will rollover. But we're -- you're beginning to see -- beginning to see the beginnings of rollover instruction costs. And I think, if we continue to see a more benign construction cost environment, it could obviously create a stronger green light for development. Yeah. Kellan Florio is not on the call. So, John will answer this for you, Neil. Yeah. So Neil, we use four fundamental evaluation factors when we look at any experiential category. Starting with lower than average cyclicality versus consumer discretionary at large, we -- what we really love about gaming is it does have lower cyclicality, and we generally want a trend toward segments that have that same characteristic. Number two, we want healthy supply demand balance. This usually means investing capital in assets that have a cost or complexity that tends to mitigate against unwarranted supply. We do not want -- number three, we do not want secular threat to be a big factor. We generally want the real estate to provide an out of home experience. That must almost by definition, be an out of home experience, and thus be less vulnerable to, as we say, getting Amazon by displacing the experience through putting it at a box or shipping it through a wire to your house. And then finally, number four, we want proven durability of the end user experience. Because the durability of the end user experience that constitutes the durability of the operator's business and it's the durability of the operator's business and ultimately constitutes the durability of our rent. Thank you, Neil. Yeah. Next question operator. Wes, let me just add. I'm sitting here with a team in our -- one of our New York conference rooms, and I'm looking at beautiful big aerial photos of a couple of our Las Vegas assets, Caesars Palace, and the Venetian. And I think one of the things we're starting to realize Wes -- and is that we need to do a better job of communicating the nature of the real estate we own, especially along Las Vegas Strip. And that when we describe it when we, or anyone else describes it as gaming real estate, we are not accurately describing it. As I look here at the Venetian, I'm looking at a complex of nearly 13 million square feet on what are we, 80, 90 acres, and gaming occupies, I think, less than about 2% of the square footage of that asset, right? And so, if you want to think about our Las Vegas assets and come up with a corollary, real estate corollary to our Las Vegas assets, I would encourage you to think of the correlate of being theme parks, right, because of the mass, the mass size complexity, layout, and development potential of these assets. And this is true of all -- 10 assets we own along the Strip or -- more true at some than others, but very true of many of them. And as an example, the Venetian -- and the photo I'm looking at, you can't even see where the MSG Sphere will go. And it represents a densification of the real estate that I think is among the most exciting development's going on in global entertainment right now. And for new music fans out there, it was just announced this last week that U2 will have the opening residency at the MSG Sphere when it opens in 2023. So, we hope in time for F1. Sorry, I got a little over excited there, Wes. Yeah. So stadiums, stadiums are intriguing. But I do think we are mindful of the fact of obsolescence risk in stadiums. For every Fenway Park or Wrigley Field or Anfield or Old Trafford, there's a stadium that had proved to have about 20 years of useful life. And then -- and Atlanta, the Atlanta baseball stadium situations, an example. I will tell you that one area of pro sports globally that we're very interested in is the whole dimension of training facilities. And as you know, Wes, that's become a bigger beginning area focus of investment for pro sports teams. And we've been having discussions and doing a lot of study around being a virtuous capital provider as global sport obviously becomes more and more a focus of capital provision. Thank you, Wes. John, do you want to do that? The other thing, I just want to make sure, Barry, no one ever loses track of or sight of is that we are as excited about global gaming investment as we have ever been. And we believe our opportunities to continue to grow in American gaming and in international gaming -- represents our most exciting, compelling, large scale growth opportunity, but just want to make sure that does not get lost. Hey, Barry, let me just add. The -- I think there's another dimension to this, that also speaks to the opportunity for gaming operators to continue to grow their competitiveness and consumer discretionary, and that relates to sports betting. And I feel like sports betting in the last, I don't know, six, nine months Barry, it feels like the dot com explosion, right, of the early 2000s when every baby got thrown out with the bath water. Right? And if in 2000 you said, okay, dot com blew up. I'm never going to own Amazon again. You just -- you don't even want to think about the value you missed out on. Right? And I think one of the things that's being missed here is that the gaming operators have made investments in increasing their bandwidth, increasing the bandwidth with which they can reach, activate, engage, and generate business from a much bigger, deeper consumer market in America. And I think we're going to see the benefits of that in the years to come, especially by the way, in which gaming, sorry, sports betting has enabled the gaming operators to activate the next-generation of customers. Again, I think the whole kind of cloud over the sports betting investments is, is really gone too far. And people are losing sight of the fact that it is going to be a key, key means by which gaming competes in the American consumer marketplace. Yeah. David, good to hear from you. I'm going to ask my colleague and partner, Samantha to offer her thoughts here, because she was our business leader on developing and creating our Cabot partnership. So Samantha? Yeah. David, I would encourage you and everybody else, they're just beginning to get to know who Cabot is, to go to their -- and I can't remember the corporate website for Cabot. Do you remember the address? Yeah. And anyway, David, as you well know, having covered the depth and breadth of hospitality and recreation that you do, so much of the scalability of a business in leisure hospitality, recreation is based upon the scalability of the management team. And one of the things I think you'll be very impressed by is the caliber of the management team that Ben Cowan-Dewar, the founder of Cabot, has put together. Because that is the limiting factor, right? That is the biggest constraint for organizations like this in terms of the scalability of their portfolio, is the scalability of their management team. And they have built an outstanding management team, as you will see when you look at their website, which is ... Give us a call, David. Give us a call. Yeah. Ronald, it's a question we're working on. The thing we would most emphasize is this would be global TAM. These are categories of leisure, entertainment, recreation, that we see investing in on a global basis. And we are only at the beginnings of determining what that TAM would be. But I think you can be confident that when looked at globally, it represents a very big universe of potential investment. John? Yeah. Good to hear from you, Spencer. John, you want to take that? Yeah. It's a good question, Jay. And the responsibility lies with us to explain the nature of the business we're investing in, the nature of the operator's business model and the credit worthiness of the operator. And we realize -- we own that responsibility and we'll exercise it very diligently. Obviously, helping people understand the gaming story was good training for what we need to be able to do and what we're responsible for doing in non-gaming. I will say, I think there's a bit of a mitigant, a positive mitigant at work, Jay, insofar yes, we have the obligation to help investors understand this new category, but with each new category, assuming we can convince them quickly that this is a category worthy of investment. It obviously also helps them answer the question, how does VICI continue to grow now that it's gotten so big? So, again, we won't shed the responsibility to educate, but we think with each new category we go in, we prove that there is a lot more we can do to continue to create value and growth at VICI. Yeah. It obviously needs to be accretive, Jay, that's absolutely the requirement. And I think that we're in a very interesting period right now. It's a period in which some people realize, it's not 2021 anymore, and other people haven't quite figured out it's not 2021 anymore. What I would say is that the marketplace of borrowers or those who need capital, has more quickly figured out that the world has changed. And with it, the pricing that goes with that change, and then there's others -- potential sellers, some of whom haven't really figured out, it's not 2021 anymore. So, it's really going to be highly circumstantial as to whether or not there's the potential to get a deal done. And it will only get done based upon mutual recognition that the world has changed and prices need to change accordingly. Thank you, Jay. Yeah. So, John always good to talk to you. It's our responsibility to educate, whether it be existing partners or potential partners and we're doing the work, as we speak of making sure that they understand not only the nature of our capital, which you're absolutely right, John, it is permanent, but also the cost -- the comparative cost of it to their, exactly your point, to their weighted average cost of capital. If you take their current yields to worst on their benchmark bonds, and then take their implied cost of equity, most of our would be -- and existing partners are looking at weighted average cost of capital that tend to be in the 10%, 11% range, right? And needless to say with good quality assets under the right leases, we can beat the hell out of that cost at the right cap rate, a cap rate that's very accretive to us, but representing capital that is very attractively priced for them. And that's again against their weighted average cost to capital. As I alluded to earlier in the call, John, there are situations where their debt in some cases is trading so wide and probably unfairly wide that in there will be cases where we can even beat the cost of debt, never mind the way -- the blended cost of debt and equity. Thank you, John. Yeah. Thank you, operator. And thanks to all of you. We're sorry to keep you a little long, but it's great to engage with all of you and we look forward very much to talking with you again next quarter. Bye for now."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of MGP, expanding our portfolio to 43 of the highest quality experiential real estate assets under our triple-net model with a combined 58,000 hotel rooms, hundreds of food and beverage and entertainment outlets, and millions of square feet of high-quality meeting and convention areas. Thanks to the tireless work of team VICI. We've completed over $29 billion of transactions since our company's formation, less than five years ago. We're very proud of these accomplishments. And at the same time, we're excited that our work has only just started. One of our primary objective that a company is to work with our existing tenants to provide capital solutions that help meet each operator's strategic objectives. As many of you have heard me say before, our team does not take a break after announcing or completing an acquisition. Our development team remains very active, expanding our relationships and sourcing opportunities that we believe will continue yielding accretive outcomes for VICI. During the second quarter, we entered in a long-term partnership with Cabot, a leading destination golf operator, where we provide funding for the redevelopment of Cabot Citrus Farms in Florida, and convert a portion of our loan to real estate ownership under a long-term sale lease back. We're very excited about this relationship and will look to potentially expand with Cabot over the coming years. While many of you enjoy asking questions about on the ground operating trends, I would like to remind you that we are a triple-net lease landlord. We collect fixed rent streams with annual escalations over very long periods of time. Those who have followed our story will recall that we continued to collect 100% of cash rent when every one of our properties was forced to close due to the government mandated restrictions in response to COVID-19. There have been many questions about the outlook for consumer spending. And I would simply repeat that our income does not fluctuate based on monthly or quarterly trends. Now, with that said in Las Vegas, the Strip continues to produce incredibly strong numbers. For example, gross gaming revenue in May was 41% above 2019 levels. And Harry Reid International Airport just registered an all-time record for passenger traffic this past June. While the growth rates are becoming more difficult to surpass given the record activity levels, the gaming industry has proven its resilience over decades. And anyone who researches operator profitability will understand that the business models are leaner and more flexible today as compared to pre-COVID years. The gaming operator successfully navigated a very uncertain period at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and emerged on stronger footing with record breaking margin expansion as they've created ways to monitor consumer activity and adjust their cost structures accordingly. We are very proud of our track record to date and our relationships with stable, industry-leading tenants. We will remain disciplined as we evaluate opportunities and ensure future acquisitions satisfy our investment criteria. Thanks to our exceptional balance sheet, which David will touch on, we believe we're in a very strong position as we evaluate growth opportunities. In an environment where cost of capital fluctuates daily, we will continue to pursue transactions with appropriate underwriting and accretion for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to David who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David? Yeah. RJ, good morning. You're giving me a heart attack already, RJ, for moving more than we've already -- more than we've already done. But look, RJ, I think your observations are good, but as good as we are doing right now, we need to continue to be disciplined in our approach to evaluating opportunities, and making sure we're meeting our investment criteria. I can assure you, and as Ed said in his opening marks, we've added resources to the development team. Not only our expertise in gaming, but we've added Kellan Florio as our Chief Investment Officer who is going to focus on non-gaming. So, more to come here, but we hear you and we're out there, turning over every rock of opportunity. Look, we feel great about Caesars, under the leadership of Tom Reeg. As you all know, we helped support them when they were El Dorado taking over the company. They had a business plan in place and they've executed it in a very disciplined way on the bricks and mortar facilities. Would we continue to do -- find opportunities to work together? We hope so. We hope that they continue to perform well, and we find opportunities to help them grow their facilities. And they've been very good partners to us, and I hope they feel that we've been good partners to them. Well, I'm going to kind of -- sound like I'm repeating myself here, but Smedes, it's nice to talk to you this morning. I mean, if you look at Las Vegas right now, Smedes, just where there could be a lot of this capital deployed, in my opening remarks I talked about the growth in Las Vegas. In May, it was 41%. GGR up over 2019 and then the June numbers came out this morning and in June grew 23% year-over-year. So, again, we have to be aware of the macro conditions going on, but there are some markets such as Las Vegas that are seeing tremendous growth. The consumer continues to visit. In my opening remarks I talked about the record number of passengers declining in Las Vegas in the month of June. And so, if you are an operator and you have a facility in Las Vegas, you can see it is a town that is growing and there could be opportunities to deploy capital creatively. And as Ed mentioned in his remarks as well, or in his comments about Las Vegas, it is a town that we have 660 acres and we'd love to continue to grow there. Yeah. Neil. Good morning. It's good to talk to you. I don't know if I have a specific category you've heard us talk about, we love the indoor water park business, the theme park business, family entertainment centers. There's parts of sports that I think are quite interesting that we're studying and parts of fitness that we're continuing to study. And as you mentioned, we're really pioneering some areas here that have not traditionally worked with a REIT. And so, we're working on different structures as Ed talked earlier in his comments that will eventually turn into real estate ownership. So I don't have a specific area, but it is nice to have an additional resource, because it's clearly and Kellan short time being with us, a little over eight weeks, our funnel has gotten a lot wider and we have the -- we've had the opportunity to talk to more companies domestically and internationally. Yeah. Barry, it's good to talk to. I don't think we have a specific number. I think we've been clear that the magnitude of gaming assets and the magnitude of EBITDA that they generate are significantly higher than what we've seen in the non-gaming space. So, we may end up doing more non-gaming transactions, but they may not add up to the quantity of rent, so to speak of just one or two gaming assets. So, we're continuing to work on this. You can hear me talk and you can hear Ed talk, hear David talk in our remarks that we are spending more time in a variety of areas in the experiential space. But we don't have a specific number today of how large that will be or what percentage will be of our total portfolio. But I think as we refine this over the coming years under Kellan's leadership, we'll have a better idea of the segments of business that we'll go into and how big they can be. And Ronald, I'll just add that. If you had asked us this question last quarter, we've probably added two or three other categories that we're now studying. So, the TAM is going to continue to, to ebb and flow as we continue to find new categories that our capital could be put to work. Yeah. We've been on the road for -- Kellan started, as I said, eight weeks ago in his first week, he was with me on a trip to Europe to look at numerous assets. We've spent some time in Canada as well. We like the country of Australia. So, we are out and about better understanding opportunities. Again, as Ed mentioned earlier, not only in non-gaming, but the opportunities in our core of gaming. So, we're active in these spaces right now and the funnel is just going to get wider as we've added more resources to our development team. Yeah. Good to hear from you, Spencer. As you know, we never comment on specific deals that are out there, but I think you're asking us, are we aware of the Crown Resorts and do we like a market like Australia and would we partner with a company like Blackstone, which obviously we have in a couple different occasions in gaming and a non-gaming. So, the answer is, would we have interest in those areas? Absolutely. We think they're wonderful assets. We think that Blackstone is a great operator. But is there an opportunity for us today? I can't comment on that, but those are areas that we would've interest in."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks John. I want to start with our balance sheet and overall liquidity available to VICI to fund future growth. To recap the second quarter events. On April 18th, VICI was upgraded to investment grade by S&P and Fitch, greatly broadening our access to permanent debt capital. On April 20th, we priced $5 billion of investment grade senior unsecured notes, executing the largest REIT investment grade bond offering ever. The blended cash interest rate for the notes was 5%, while the effective interest rate after taking into account our $3 billion hedge portfolio was 4.51%. On April 29th, we closed down the acquisition of MGP as well as the $5 billion bond offering. We used 4.4 billion of the proceeds to fund our redemption of a majority of MGM's MGP OP units. The remaining proceeds plus cash on hand were used to repay the outstanding balance on a revolving credit facility. The company also issued approximately $4.1 billion of aggregate principle amount of senior notes in exchange for and with the same interest rate, maturity date and redemption terms as notes originally issued by MGP pursuant to the settlement of the exchange offers and consent solicitations. Following the settlement of the exchange offers and consent solicitations, approximately 90 million of original MGP notes remain outstanding. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with a total -- with total debt of $15.5 billion inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA pro forma for a full year of rent from the MGP transaction is approximately 5.8 times. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.38% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 7.2 years to maturity. We have had many accomplishments in our short existence as a public company, but being added to the S&P 500 index on June 8th is a continued endorsement of our growth. As mentioned, VICI was the fastest REIT to be added to the S&P 500 index from IPO to inclusion. And we believe being added to the index will broaden our investor base and improve our access to equity capital. During the quarter we sold approximately at 11.4 million shares with an aggregate value of $367.4 million before fees under our ATM program. All of the shares were sold subject to a forward sale agreement, and as such are not reflected on our balance sheet. As of June 30th, with approximately $4.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $614 million in cash and cash equivalence, $360 million of estimated net proceeds available upon settlement of our forward sale agreement, $2.5 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility and $1 billion of availability under the delayed draw facility. In July, the revolving credit facility was amended to permit borrowings in certain foreign currencies up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1.25 billion enhancing our financial flexibility. Turning to the income statement. AFFO for the second quarter was $430.1 million or $0.48 per share. Total AFFO in Q2 increased 67.9% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 4% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from the equity raised and shares issued to consummate our transformative acquisition of MGP. At the end of Q2, the company has approximately 963 million shares of common stock outstanding and VICI OP has 12.2 million additional OP units outstanding held by MGM, which were received in the merger. A full reconciliation of the share count is included in our earnings release. Our results, once again, highlight our highly efficient triple-net model, given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in a high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $11.8 million for the quarter. And as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.8%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. We believe this represents the appropriate go-forward run rate when accounting for the increase in certain expenses related to the MGP acquisition I just want to touch on CECL or current expected credit losses, out of the $552 million non-cash charge we incurred in Q2, 80% or approximately $443 million was related to the initial allowance we were required to record upon entering into the MGM master lease. This allowance did reduce our GAAP net income for the quarter, but as previously noted non-cash CECL charges do not impact cash flow or AFFO. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars, as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other non-recurring transactions. The per share estimates reflect the impact of treasury accounting related to the pending 11.4 million forward shares sold from our ATM program in Q2. And as we have discussed, we recorded non-cash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and AFFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. AFFO for the year ending December 31st, 2022 is expected to be between $1.66 billion and $1.69 billion, or between $1.89 and $1.92 per diluted common share. With that operator, please open the line for questions. Hey, Tony, it's David. Good to talk to you. It's really an opportunistic use of the ATM. And as I mentioned, we put it under the forward agreement. So, with the inclusion in the S&P 500 index, we saw elevated volumes in a level and a priced -- share price that we thought made sense to raise a little equity just for the -- given the current state of the environment and enhance our overall liquidity. The gross was $360 million 7.04? Sorry Smedes. The gross number was $367.4 million and the net was $360 million. So, these were market fees. Wes, this is David. Good to talk to you. I mean, I missed a little tail end of that, but let try to just address ... Max. Thank you. So, well, it depends on the project. We are actively working with all of our tenants. They understand that, that we have the partner property growth fund and that we have the ability to invest into their assets, as we talked about on this call and this serves as an attractive source of funding for our tenants. So somewhat depends on the project. The Venetian, for example, we committed a billion dollar to the partner property growth fund, and that billion dollars could go into the -- or the continuation of the funding of the hotel that was stopped in 2008. It could go into some other expansion ideas and renovation ideas that the Apollo team has. And we hope that some of that may start later this year, but it's again, all up to our tenants and their timing. And then in terms of the deployment of that, the nice thing about the partner property growth fund, it's important that does not come all at once. If it's a new hotel tower or we take the Mirage where Hard Rock coming in and we've committed up to $1.5 billion, if they so choose to use that money, that's a 12, 18, 24-month redevelopment timeline where we get to -- going to deploy that capital on a monthly basis, not having to go to the market to raise large amounts of capital day one. So, it's a flow business for VICI, and attractive funding source for VICI. In terms of max size, that's -- we want to be cognizant of the development risk. At the end of the day, we are not the developer, but our capital obviously is going into projects that are being developed. And it'll depend on where that capital is, whether it's in gaming, non-gaming, if it's on the Strip or if it's regional. So, we're going to be cognizant of the total size, but right now I don't have a threshold for you. But we're going to -- we're excited to use it. We're excited to help our tenants grow. Barry, it's David. Good to talk to you. As Ed alluded to, and as we talked about a lot, right, the gaming customer will always game. And one of the things that's going on in our underwriting more specifically is obviously there's been a ramp up in EBITDAR over the last -- post COVID. EBITDAR is much greater than it was in 2019 and before. And so one of the things that we're working with, anything we evaluate is what is the true run rate? What is -- where does the margin settle out? And I think, we're all comfortable that EBITDAR is going to be greater than 2019, but is it really going to be double or triple, or is it more, one in three quarters times or two times. And so, we're spending a lot of time with the operators on their belief of the future -- the market, and it all depends on the market, the asset and the opportunity. And in terms of credit quality, that's of us -- a big focus of us and with our master leases, our corporate guarantees and knowing the operators, the way that John and Danny and team know the operators we're able to underwrite the overall opportunity. And we talked about the acquisition environment. We continue to believe our ability to put points on the board here as we go forward."

I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our first quarter 2022 earnings release and our supplemental information. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties described herein, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Danny Valoy, Vice President of Finance. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak : Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Happy Cinco de Mayo. When we held our last earnings call in late February, we had just closed on our acquisition of The Venetian, one of the largest scale and highest quality single assets in American commercial real estate. As we speak with you today, we have just closed on our acquisition of MGM Growth Properties, MGP, one of the largest scale and highest quality portfolios of Class A real estate in American real estate investing. VICI's story over the last 14 months since we first announced our acquisition of The Venetian, is a story of transformation. We have transformed the scale of our portfolio, our tenant and geographic diversity and very importantly, the character and quality of our balance sheet. We've also become the leading real estate owner on what we believe is the most economically productive street in the world, the Las Vegas strip. In a moment, John Payne will talk further about the transformation of our portfolio, and David Kieske will talk further about the transformation of our balance sheet. But let me first spend a few moments talking with you about what's been proven about our business model over the last 2 years and how timely our current transformation may prove to be from both offensive and defensive perspective over a coming period of economic uncertainty. Over the last 2 years, COVID-19 proved the resiliency of VICI's business model because COVID proved the resiliency of our tenants' business models. VICI collected 100% of our rent in cash and on time throughout the COVID-19 crisis because of the operating excellence and operating liquidity of our tenants. Our operators have shown their ability to operate through thick and thin. The economic outlook for the next year or 2 may be murky, but we firmly believe that our operators' prepared their operating revenue, cost and liquidity models for whatever may be coming. What about our view on VICI's ability to continue to grow in the coming period? There are 5 key capabilities as we see it to growing as a net lease REIT in all cycles, including whatever cycle may be about doing 2. Number one, same-store NOI growth based on key lease terms regarding escalation and CPI protection; number two, internal funding capability based on cash retention; number three, the capability and opportunity to invest incrementally in existing assets and return for incremental rent; number four, the ability to source acquisitions when the frequency and intensity of asset marketing processes lessen; number five, access to investment-grade credit when high-yield markets may be constricted or costly. Let me say a few words about VICI's growth capabilities in each of these 5 areas: point number one, same-store NOI growth. Green Street in the September 2021 analysis showed that VICI generates same-store NOI growth more than 4x higher than net lease rates on average. And in terms of higher -- in times, sorry, of higher inflation, VICI's same-store NOI superiority versus other net lease rates expand when factoring in the CPI owned into our leases. Point number two, internal funding capability. Pro forma for the annualization of VICI's net income and debt service, having enclosed Venetian and MGP, if we maintain a dividend payout ratio between 75% and 80%, that would leave between $400 million to $500 million of retained earnings available to us for investment annually, a competitive advantage during periods when market may be constricted. Point number three, investing incrementally in existing property in return for incremental rent. Our assets measure, on average, over 2.5 million square feet and sit on many acres of land. That scale of building and land enable us to invest incrementally in our existing properties in ways generally not available to net lease REITs whose stores generally average around 25,000 square feet, 1/100 the size of our assets. Point number four, sourcing acquisitions when asset marketing processes lessen. You've heard us say before that we grow our business at VICI and our portfolio by growing our relationships. As we pursue both gaming and non-gaming investments in the coming years outside of marketing processes, we are confident that our ability to generate new relationships with operators who operate in net lease white space will give us growth advantages. Point number five, in -- just to investment grade with high-yield credit markets tighten. Through the great work of David Kieske, Erin Ferreri and other members of our finance team, we achieved investment-grade status with S&P and Fitch about 2 weeks ago. We may be in the early stages of a challenging period for the high-yield credit markets and CMBS financing. We believe that the relative competitiveness and attractiveness of our capital could increase during the coming period as experiential operators look to refinance their existing businesses and/or fund their growth initiatives. To sum up, VICI has gotten bigger and moreover stronger at a -- we believe advantages will accrue to those REITs that are bigger and stronger.  I'll now turn the call over to John, who will talk about our new portfolio and operating conditions and to David, who will talk about our financial results and balance sheet upgrade. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. The first 4 months of 2022 were very productive for VICI. In February, we completed The Venetian Las Vegas transaction. And just last week, as Ed noted, we closed on the acquisition of MGP adding 15 Class A market-leading assets with over 33,000 hotel rooms, 3.6 million square feet of convention space and hundreds of food and beverage outlets to our portfolio. As a management team, having the opportunity to acquire the MGP portfolio in a master lease structured where the cash flow is cross-collateralized with inflation protection beginning in lease year 11 and a corporate guarantee from MGM Resorts is something we are very proud to have accomplished on behalf of our shareholders. Our 43 asset portfolio is unmatched in size, scope and quality in the triple net sector, and we plan to continue to grow our asset base with our best-in-class tenant roster as well as new operators. As some of you may know from recent data that has been released, Las Vegas continues to be a top destination choice by consumers and the Las Vegas Strip remains one of the most economically productive streets in the world. Gaming revenue in Las Vegas in March alone came in at $746 million, approximately 35% above 2019 levels. I'm going to repeat that, approximately 35% above 2019 levels. Additionally, the outlook for room revenue is very strong as midweek business continues to normalize with convention business returning to the city. On their first quarter earnings call, both MGM and Caesars cited 90% hotel occupancy in March and Las Vegas room rate surveys published by the Sell Side have pointed to second quarter ADRs that are tracking 30% above 2019 levels. The City of Las Vegas with its diversified entertainment economy that is no longer just about gambling, but centered around business, sports, and entertainment, continues to prove to be the top destination in the U.S. and possibly the world. As a real estate investment trust in the business of owning and leasing integrated entertainment resorts within a triple-net structure, we are big believers in Las Vegas for decades to come and are incredibly excited to now own 10 world-class assets and a total of 660 acres along the Las Vegas Strip. Our regional casino assets with regional markets in general also remained extremely healthy. In case you somehow missed the first 4 months of 2022, I'll give you the cliff note version. In a nutshell, the casino industry is in amazing shape right now. Several operators, including Boyd Gaming, Churchill Downs, MGM and Caesars have made it quite clear with their quarter 1 earnings releases and conference calls that the reports of the decline of the U.S. regional casino margins have been greatly exaggerated. April results have continued the March strength and not only is the gaming consumer healthy, wealthy and wise, they are still choosing to spend money on gambling despite having many other entertainment options. As we think about what comes next for VICI, we are fortunate to have executed some of the largest and most complex transactions in the net lease industry, and we will continue working relentlessly to execute compelling opportunities that deliver accretive value for our shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results, our balance sheet and our guidance. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. I'll start with our balance sheet. At the beginning of 2022, encapsulates the energy we have brought to transforming our balance sheet since VICI emerged in October 2017. We have discussed this relentless balance sheet focus with you over the last 4.5 years. We believe it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners to -- deserve. Not to spend too much time on 2021, but is a good reminder of how we take the long-term view to safeguard our company. We raised a combined total of $5.4 billion of equity at the time of the announcement of The Venetian acquisition and shortly after the announcement of the MGP transaction. These equity offerings derisk the equity funding well ahead of closing on our $21 billion of announced acquisitions and allowed us to repay all of our secured debt last September. These actions set us up for success in early 2022 and for years to come. On February 8, we closed on our new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $1 billion delayed draw term loan, increasing overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital. On February 23, we closed on the $4 billion acquisition of Venetian through the settlement of 2 outstanding forwards, bringing 119 million shares onto the balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. We also drew $600 million on our revolver, and used cash on hand to fund The Venetian. On April 18, VICI's debt rating was upgraded to BBB- by S&P and Fitch, greatly broadening our access to permanent debt capital. On April 20, we priced $5 billion of investment-grade senior unsecured notes, executing on the largest REIT investment-grade bond offering ever. The blended cash interest rate for the senior unsecured notes was 5%. The effective interest rate after taking into account our hedge portfolio, which was comprised of $2.5 billion in notional amount of forward starting swaps and $500 million in notional amount of treasury locks is 4.51%. On April 29, we closed on the acquisition of MGP as well as a $5 billion bond offering. We used $4.404 billion of the bond offering proceeds to fund our redemption of a majority of MGM's MGP OP units. Following the MGP acquisition, the company has approximately 963 million shares of common stock outstanding and VICI OP has 12.2 million additional OP units outstanding held by MGM that were received in the merger. The remaining proceeds from the bond offering plus cash on hand were used to repay the $600 million outstanding under VICI's revolving credit facility. In terms of leverage, we ended Q1 2022 with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.6x. This highlights the fact that we significantly over-equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the MGP acquisition, positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction. As we sit here today, pro forma for the MGP transaction, we have total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt on a run rate net debt to adjusted EBITDA -- excuse me, on a run rate, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 8.4 years to maturity. Just touching on the income statement. AFFO for the first quarter was $305.5 million or $0.44 per share. Total AFFO in Q1 2022 increased 19.8% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 5.1% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 26.3% primarily as a result of the regular weight portion of the September 2021 equity offering, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet, the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement last September, which added 26.9 million shares to our balance sheet and the settlement of the March and September 4 sale agreements in February of 2022, which added 119 million shares to our balance sheet. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $9.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.3%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Turning to guidance. We are updating our AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activities or other nonrecurring transactions. And as we have discussed in the past, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. Our guidance incorporates the recently closed MGP acquisition, including the issuance of 214.5 million shares of common stock to former MGP stockholders and the $5 billion bond offering we executed subsequent to quarter end. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2022 will be between $1.66 billion and $1.69 billion or between $1.89 and $1.92 per diluted share. With that, operator, we ask you to please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: Congratulations on everything you guys have gotten done recently. My first question is, just given everything that you've all done and getting past all that, what has it done to just the conversations you're having on future growth and opportunities? Has it expanded sort of your discussions and just increased the profile and stuff that you're looking at? And how are you organizing all those thoughts?\nEd Pitoniak : John, you want to start?\nJohn Payne: Sure. Well, Tony, thanks for the comments, and it's always nice to hear from you. There's no doubt, Tony, that we've changed quite a bit as a company from when we started the company back in 2017 just due to size, scale, scope, magnitude of assets, and it has got the attention of folks that I think when we started the company, did not know exactly who we were and what we were doing. So the funnel is definitely as wide as it's ever been for us. There are numerous opportunities. You've heard us talk about, obviously, gaming opportunities, we'll continue to pursue in markets where we want to own more real estate or we don't own real estate. And then there are a lot of companies that have noticed what we've done in the experiential space. You've heard Ed and David and myself, Danny, others talk about making real estate investments outside of gaming and in experiential and we've been in contact with. And so as Ed in his comments, we build relationships, and we build relationships that we hope turn into real estate ownership. And so we are organizing, we're meeting, we're traveling. We're doing all that right now, Tony. And we'll see how it plays into our growth, but we feel really good about the magnitude of opportunities that we see in front of us.\nEd Pitoniak : Tony, I'll just add to that. I think sort of a truism across every real estate asset class that there are benefits in owning marquee assets that are well known to whatever category or well known within whatever category you're in because it increases your visibility. And we were fairly invisible when we got going 4.5 years ago. And there is no question that in owning assets like Caesars Palace Las Vegas, like The Venetian, like MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, like National Harbor, like Caesars New Orleans, we are teaming a visibility that is very, very helpful, as John points out, and giving us greater top-of-mind status when people think about who they'll call.\nAnthony Paolone : Got it. Okay. And then with regards to the opportunities to reinvest in the asset base, including things like the Mirage. Can you talk about timing and around maybe hearing more about a project like that? And also, just does anything in the rate environment or macro volatility change the thinking or prospects for some of those investments? Or do the trends on the ground there kind of win the day right now?\nEd Pitoniak : David, do you want to start with answering the second half of Tony's question and then John can add.\nDavid Kieske: Sure. We -- look, we're very cognizant of the macro trends, right? We were fortunate to get our bond offering off a couple of weeks ago just -- and execute what we were able to execute. Every day brings something new volatility with the Fed speak yesterday. So we're going to work to ensure that our partner property growth loan is ultimately what we're talking about here, delivers accretive returns. And that's -- I touched on that being able to invest in these magnificent assets of size, scale and complexity that rivals nothing other out there. We will make sure that the capital that we deployed generates an incremental return that's accretive to us.\nJohn Payne: As it pertains to the Mirage, Tony, the Hard Rock team is going through the licensing process in the state of Nevada. They're amazing developers and operators. And we obviously are already partners with them in our Cincinnati asset. And so we're excited with what they are going to have planned for the redevelopment of the Mirage and the Hard Rock Las Vegas. But no timing yet as they need to go through that process.\nEd Pitoniak : Tony, I just want to add one more thing. And that is that we -- often in the early years, we're often told by would be partners that, oh, I can borrow money cheaper than your money, VICI. And we are very humble about admitting. We are learning every day how to tell our story better. And what we've really focused on of late is helping people understand that our capital and the cost of it should not be compared simply to the cost of their debt, but to their blended cost of capital, accounting for both the cost of their debt and the cost of their equity. And even before we saw the recent widening of credit spreads and before we saw the recent multiple contraction of many operators across experiential both gaming and non-gaming, our cost of capital versus their blended cost of capital is already very attractive. It's only grown more attractive in the last couple of months.\nAnthony Paolone : Okay. And then just last one very quick, I guess, somewhat related to that. Like what is your preference or thinking right now as you think about yields and contractual growth? Like do you want more inflation protection or more upfront yield? Or how do you think about the balance of that? Or are you solving for an IRR? What's the thought process there?\nEd Pitoniak : David, do you want to take that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Tony, I mean, ultimately, we're solving for a spread to our cost of capital. And like every deal is different. Obviously, inflation and CPI discussions are more relevant today than they were when we started VICI. But ultimately, as a net lease company delivering an attractive 100 basis points, 150 basis points, sometimes less, sometimes more spread to our cost of capital is what we strive for. We also look at our underwriting in terms of cash-on-cash returns and the IRR over a period of time to ensure that we are delivering incremental accretive deals to our shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway from Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Maybe just going back to external growth for a minute. Just in regards to the ROFRs and other put-call agreements you have in place with operators, has there been any discussion on those eligible for execution? And how do you think about the relative attractiveness of these?\nEd Pitoniak : John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, Spenser. As you -- as it pertains to the ROFRs, I assume you're referring to the Las Vegas ROFR. I'll just refer you to the CEO of Caesars, Tom Reeg, who during his earnings call was very clear on what is going on, which he said, look, Caesars has started the process in early '22. He expects there to be another update by the middle of the summer, and the sales process really is governed by the VICI agreement documents. And so that process is in the works. We're aware of the agreements we have with them. Today, as I said in my opening remarks, we do own 10 great assets on The Strip in Las Vegas, which make up about 600 -- we also have 660 acres that those assets sit on as well as vacant land. It is a market that is truly incredible. As I stated, when you have business up 35% gaming revenues is simply amazing, and it really is as their new ad campaign says the greatest arena on earth. And so that is a market that we are big fans of. We'll continue to study. Do we want to own additional real estate? If we do, it needs to come to us in a very accretive manner. And we'll continue to follow our process on that.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. That's great color. And I know you just mentioned, obviously, Vegas revenue has been strong, but just curious if in conversations with the operators, have you guys gained a sense of how regional and/or Vegas operating margins have held up with the inflation pressure?\nJohn Payne: Yes. It's another good question, and many have released their earnings. I just -- a friendly reminder that for us, rent is paid with margin dollars not necessarily not margin percentage points. So, if you take a company like one of our tenants, Penn, which generated almost $50 million more in margin dollars year-over-year with the earnings that just came out. So the businesses continue to be incredibly strong, especially when you compare it to other businesses around the United States. So we couldn't be happier. As Ed said in his comments about our tenants, how they've adjusted their business, how their margins are up. Most importantly, their margin dollars are up. Many are seeing record EBITDA. I think Caesars announced that 18 properties set all-time records in Q run EBITDA. So Spenser, I could go on and on about our tenant's bit. It's exciting to see that the -- even with the macro issues going on, they are about continuing to perform very well.\nEd Pitoniak : One point answer that Spenser that I'd like to add -- Spenser I was just going to say one more point I want to add on top of what John just rightly said, is that with all the focus on inflation, I think it's important to note that, obviously, we, VICI, enjoy superior CPI protection in our leases versus other triple nets. But I also want to make sure everyone understands that our tenants are in the business of nightly leases, and in some cases, even hourly leases, and that pertains to their ability to constantly reprice in respect to demand and in respect to inflation. And I think that, going back to John's point, is a key factor in ensuring they continue to produce all the margin dollars they can possibly produce given their ability based on nightly -- the lease business to constantly reprice.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I wanted to ask just a little bit as you look at potential opportunities, are you seeing any change at this point in potential transaction cap rates just with the rising cost of capital, but kind of weighing that against the continued kind of institutionalization of this real estate space and improving operating trends that you pointed out? Or is it too soon to sort of see any meaningful changes?\nEd Pitoniak : Yes. It's a very, very good and very timely question, Smedes. In my experience, and I guess this is one of these rare occasions when it actually pays to get old, what I've seen over the years is it when you enter a period of tightening, when the cost of credit and/or equity go up, it usually takes sellers longer to recognize the change in reality than does it for the buyers, right? And so I think right now, we're probably in somewhat of a situation of a slack tide where there's really -- on the part of would be sellers or would be buyers a bit of hesitancy as to well, what is market, right? We are fortunate that we have a number of discussions going on that have a momentum to them that can carry both us and our potential partners past this hesitation regarding the future cost of capital. But I do think we'll probably see a period as we have in so many cycles where it will take some time for buyers and sellers to recalibrate. It will take some time to re-find equilibrium, but it's pretty axiomatic that if the cost and the availability of capital goes up, so -- sorry, the cost of capital goes up and the availability goes down, cap rates tend to go up accordingly. Now -- sorry to go on so long. In gaming, it may end up adding to somewhat of a more or less a stasis in cap rates because this is a category that as you were saying, Smedes, has been seeing cap rate compression, perhaps the velocity of compression slows or maybe even stops, but it may be a category where you won't see cap rate expansion given the increasing interest in the category as we've seen over the last year or 2.\nSmedes Rose : Great. That's interesting. I just wanted to switch gears, John, again, switch and go through the transcript of operators. But I'm just wondering, it sounds like the leisure customer is still very strong in Las Vegas. Do you have any thoughts on how the convention business is lining up over the next year or so, I guess, or however you think about it?\nJohn Payne: Yes. I mean based on what we've heard, we now have Caesars, MGM and The Venetian running assets in Las Vegas who run the largest convention business there that they are seeing that business planning to return later this year and very strong, as you've heard them say in their earnings in 2023. Smedes I was quoting the gaming revenue, but what I haven't quoted yet is another thing Caesars said in their earnings, their Las Vegas properties in the month of April had record room revenue. So that's pretty amazing in a place where they're also getting strong gaming revenue. So you can see the consumer, I mean, most importantly for our tenants, the consumer simply has not found a substitute for their entertainment dollars, that Vegas continues to be, again, the #1 destination in America. I've argued with my colleagues, it's the number one destination in the world right now. And not only is the customer coming who wants to gamble, but we're seeing that they diversified these resorts, and they're getting business travel. They're getting room revenue, they're getting food and beverage revenues, spa revenue, pool revenue. And it's the beauty of these integrated resorts. And all the credit goes to our operators and how they're running these facilities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.\nBarry Jonas: Given the scale and size of VICI to date, how many strategy or perhaps your minimum requirements change at all?\nEd Pitoniak : I would say generally not. And if I guess at what might underlie your question, given that VICI has gotten so big, will VICI sort of establish a red line below which we do not go in terms of asset size or NOI. And I think the answer is no. Again, as a triple net REIT, we enjoy rent per asset that's up over $50 million. The average triple net store produces about $250,000 a year rent. We will always evaluate the materiality of a given asset not unto itself, but really as part of a larger relationship with whomever may either currently own and want a sale leaseback that asset or an operator with whom we partner in the acquisition of that asset. So we will be much more focused on the long-term growth potential of a given category or opportunity or partnership than we would on individual assets. And that's how we believe over time, we'll develop a more sustained and sustainable business model of deal flow.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Great. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up question, are you seeing a wider group of REITs out there now looking at gaming deals? And maybe to what extent are you competing with operators looking to do holdco deals?\nEd Pitoniak : David, you want to take that?\nJohn Payne: I'll go ahead and jump in. I mean, obviously, we've seen with the Wind transaction in Boston Realty Income getting into the casino space. But for us, ever since we started the company, we always knew there was going to be competition in this space. Clearly, people have seen the resiliency of the model. They've seen the high quality of the assets. They've seen how it's performed in the toughest time ever, which was COVID with the business shutdown and rebounding with all the records that I've been talking about today. So that obviously has attracted more potential owners of the real estate or of the holdco as you mentioned. So we go into every transaction, expecting that there's going to be competition. And we are not surprised at all that there are more folks that are interested in this just incredible real estate space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Kornreich from SMBC.\nJay Kornreich: Thanks again for getting MGP done and everything else. Just going back to interest rates, but in a different question that as the rising interest rates are putting pressure on what was previously expressing cap rates, can you kind of walk us through how you think about the puts and takes in structuring new leads of such items like cap rate, rent coverage, inflation, CPI kickers and what opportunities there may be for you to potentially get more aggressive?\nEd Pitoniak : David, do you want to take that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Jay, thanks for the question. I mean as I mentioned a little bit earlier, each deal is unique and not every -- not one size fits all. So what is critical for us is that any transaction that we ultimately underwrite and ultimately announce and then sign up is accretive day 1, right? You saw some hotel REITs in the last day or 2 announced a 4 cap and they're going to turn it into an 8 or 9 yield. We can't do that under our structure. And if we ever did that, that would probably be our last deal that we ever did. So obviously, CPI is a very hot topic these days, but it's important for us to have escalators that are: one are reasonable for the market that we're in, whether that's regional, super regional, Vegas destination and then annual bumps that work for us and work for the operator. And we ultimately want to push for no CPI caps and the operators are pushing back on that a little bit. And so it's always a negotiation in terms of value, duration of lease the cap rate that we can pay. There's a few levers that we underwrite with to make sure that we are underwriting a strong credit and a strong operator that has conviction that coming into the market. But obviously, we want to -- our fundamental goal is to make sure that we -- what we sign up is accretive from day 1 because we live with that for 30 years plus.\nEd Pitoniak : Jay, I will just add that a bit of wisdom that one of our most important and valuable Board members, who many of you know, Craig Macnab, one of the first adages he shared with us is that gentleman, the rent should be as low as possible. And we absolutely believe in that. We want our rent to be as low as possible in regard to the economics of the tenant's business because the lower the rent as a percentage of their economics, the more successful they will be, the better at credit they will be and the more willing and able they will be to occupy the building for a very, very long time to come.\nJay Kornreich: Yes, absolutely. I mean certainly, the portions of the tenant accrued to the landlord. That makes a lot of sense. And then I guess just as a follow-up, we previously spoke about the benefits of becoming investment grade and the lower cost of capital that comes with it, which may open up the door for more non-gaming opportunities. So just curious about how you're thinking about that at this time now that you've achieved the investment-grade status.\nEd Pitoniak : David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Jay. I mean we're thrilled to be here, and we'll continue to, as we talked about on the debt roadshow and the debt marketing process, we'll continue to migrate up to BBB curve over time. We'll continue to diversify our tenants, bring our leverage back to the 5x and 5.5x that we've always been very focused on from day 1. Thanks to Erin's great work with the -- Erin Ferreri and her team. Thanks to her great work with the agencies, we're able to get that rating upgrade on April 18. But that does definitely broaden the funnel as another question that was asked earlier. At the end of the day, we're spread investing. So if we can lower our cost of capital, not only through the debt markets and as we migrate up the credit curve, obviously, the cost of capital can be reduced. And then with the index inclusion that has occurred with the MGP Class A shareholders being converted to VICI Class -- to VICI shareholders and then potentially one day S&P 500 inclusion, we can continue to lower our cost of equity capital to -- as you said, Jay, and frankly, so broaden that funnel and continue to diversify both in and outside of gaming.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: I just wanted to talk about kind of the next phase, if I'm characterizing it right, where some of the acquisitions that you may pursue, come from internal -- or funded by internal capital sources or cash flow and the accretion that comes out of that. How big of a trend is that? And is that something we should be thinking about this year?\nEd Pitoniak : David, do you want to start? And\u2026\nDavid Kieske: As Ed mentioned, and we've talked about our free cash flow after dividends and that's true free cash flow is somewhere $400 million to $500 million of run rate. So you kind of think about levering that 1:1 up to $1 billion of buying power. And so small gaming deals like the Century deal that we announced in June of '19, $278 million that can be done with cash on hand. And so all that accretion dropped straight to the bottom line. And some of the non-gaming stuff that you see us do is obviously smaller just by the opportunities that were presented in front of us at the time. And so those -- that's free cash flow. We don't have to go to the equity markets and do what we did last year and raise $5.4 billion of equity for the transformations that we undertook. We're thrilled to have done them, and we wouldn't know looking back. But I think as we continue to grow, as Ed said, that's sustained and sustainable flow business as you'll see more of that going forward. Hopefully that answers your question, David.\nEd Pitoniak : David Katz, I would just....\nDavid Katz: Just a follow -- please go ahead.\nEd Pitoniak : Yes, David Katz, I was just going to add that when we look at retained cash as a capital source. We are very cognizant that is the shareholders' money and our obligation to produce a superior return and investment spread on the use of that cash is every bit as strong as it would be if we're going out into the market raising equity.\nDavid Katz : Right. And if I can -- just follow up. I think the last part of my question is, is there a landscape that you could see some of these kinds of opportunities happening next 12 months-ish?\nEd Pitoniak : Yes. I'd say, John, we're very confident of that. Are we not?\nJohn Payne: We are. We are. Obviously, David can't tell you when our next transaction, Sam's smiling at me -- that I can't tell you when our next transaction will be. But in all seriousness, I -- we're as -- you've heard me say, we're as busy as we've ever been. The funnel is wider than it's ever been for numerous reasons that we talked about earlier of our size, our scope. And so I think that's very realistic within the next year or so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: So last night The Flamingo is currently being marketed by Caesars. There's also the information that some investors have not been interested at the marketed $1 billion plus valuation, which -- and it leads us to 2 questions. The first is the fact the property is being more widely marketed, I mean you also passed on that initial price. And then two, what kind of cap rate would you target for an investment of that size, given cost capital they imposed, leverage limits and your desire for immediate accretion?\nEd Pitoniak : Well, Greg always been good to talk to you, and you definitely get the award at least so far for asking the questions that we can and will not answer on this call. I think John did a good job of describing what Tom Reeg was on record saying the other day, and I don't know, John, I think we just -- we leave it there.\nJohn Payne: Couldn't agree more.\nGreg McGinniss: Well, I figured, I had to shoot my shot there. But maybe as a second follow-up.\nEd Pitoniak : You absolutely do. Full marks for asking.\nGreg McGinniss: So separately then. So based on current inflation numbers, can you just give us some indication as to what's being -- assuming guidance for the escalators for the remainder of the year?\nEd Pitoniak : David?\nDavid Kieske: Hey, Greg, it\u2019s David. Similar to but not including unannounced acquisitions or dispositions or capital markets activities, guidance includes this, the base case escalators.\nGreg McGinniss: So does that mean where it could be greater of 2% in CPI or assuming 2%? Or how should we think about that?\nDavid Kieske: It doesn't include any CPI, estimates around CPI because that's a guessing game, and so we can't predict the future. If we could, we'd probably be doing something else. So the base rate in the leases that's in the guidance number.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And the CPI numbers...\nEd Pitoniak : And then Greg -- I was just going to say, Greg, the key period for CPI measurement for us comes in the early second half of the year, isn't that the right way to think about it, David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. For the bump in November, we look at September, August and July numbers and compare that to the prior year, and then that's what gets factored into the increase November 1. For the 2 Caesars leases, the Caesars master lease and the Caesars Las Vegas lease.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Tallman.\nJohn Massocca : So given some of the kind of new stories or prints we've seen on Las Vegas land prices or even assets that maybe have more of a redevelopment component to them. How are you thinking about your landholdings in Las Vegas? And maybe can you kind of remind us what the process would be for either monetizing those or kind of turning them into development, if opportunities arose on that front?\nEd Pitoniak : John and perhaps Samantha, you want to take that?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Just as a reminder, we have really 34 acres in Las Vegas that are underdeveloped, 7 are in front of Caesars Palace. Those -- that sits inside the Las Vegas master lease, and then there are an incremental 27 acres that we own. Caesars also owns some acreage next to our 27 acres. As it pertains to development, as you can imagine, as you -- and you are alluding to or as you mentioned, there have been some significant sales of real estate acreage on the Las Vegas Strip or near the Las Vegas Strip. It continues to make our land very valuable. And the process would work if we were to develop would be with Caesars on the land, particularly in front of Caesars Palace as well as the land that is behind The Flamingo, behind Paris and Bally's. We would work in partnership with them should there be an appropriate development. But we sure do like the prices that are coming out, if they are completely true. I think there was one that just took place, small acreage of almost over $30 million an acre. So we're excited to see that. And it's not that surprising when you heard the statistics. I went through in my opening remarks about this city and the success of these resorts and how the operators have turned them into incredible places of EBITDA generation.\nJohn Massocca : Okay. And then in terms of the competitive set, you talked a little bit about public REITs in the marketplace. Have you seen any change in either private investors in casino real estate or maybe some of the kind of not publicly traded players that are out there, given some of the moves in cost of debt capital. I mean, has that competitive set changed at all? Any color there would be helpful.\nEd Pitoniak : Yes. So I think, John, there's actually 2 interesting things going on. One is the increasing institutional interest in net lease generally. Any of you who read PERE would have seen yesterday the publication of an article as to how new names like KKR and Aries and Carlyle are coming into the net lease space. And there's obviously been other PE firms and credit firms that are focusing on net lease generally. And then within that lease, there is exactly as you're saying, or suggesting increased interest from publicly non-traded REITs and net lease-focused private equity firms on what is, we believe, one of the most compelling forms of triple net real estate there is, which is to say, gaming real estate. And I think it's important to recognize, too, that in focusing on gaming -- actually I'm losing the point there. I think the key point is yet that absolute increased interest because of both the superiority of the net lease model generally and the incredible attractiveness of gaming real estate.\nJohn Massocca : But I guess maybe over the short term, given what we've seen interest rate moves since the beginning of the year, has that demand change at all? I understand long term, you've seen kind of institutional capital gravitate towards this. Has some of that had to fade away because, frankly, their cost of debt financing has gone up?\nEd Pitoniak : Yes. Again, I think it goes back to the answer I gave to Smedes, John, and that is the degree to which there may be a bit of a slack tide right now because, to your point, as an example, the CMBS market has tightened up quite a bit. And there is probably not quite the gold rush fever as there might have been 6 months ago, but it has not gone away because these people are sitting on an awful lot of dry powder.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'd like to pass back over to Ed Pitoniak, CEO, for any final remarks.\nEd Pitoniak : Thank you, operator. In closing, we thank you for your time with us this morning, especially given how busy all of you are. It is insane how much earnings reporting is going on this week in the REIT sector. With your support, VICI has become one of America's leading REITs in portfolio scale and quality and in economic magnitude. We will continue to work hard for you every day. We look forward to connecting again when we report our second quarter results. Bye for now.\nOperator: Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Happy Cinco de Mayo. When we held our last earnings call in late February, we had just closed on our acquisition of The Venetian, one of the largest scale and highest quality single assets in American commercial real estate. As we speak with you today, we have just closed on our acquisition of MGM Growth Properties, MGP, one of the largest scale and highest quality portfolios of Class A real estate in American real estate investing. VICI's story over the last 14 months since we first announced our acquisition of The Venetian, is a story of transformation. We have transformed the scale of our portfolio, our tenant and geographic diversity and very importantly, the character and quality of our balance sheet. We've also become the leading real estate owner on what we believe is the most economically productive street in the world, the Las Vegas strip. In a moment, John Payne will talk further about the transformation of our portfolio, and David Kieske will talk further about the transformation of our balance sheet. But let me first spend a few moments talking with you about what's been proven about our business model over the last 2 years and how timely our current transformation may prove to be from both offensive and defensive perspective over a coming period of economic uncertainty. Over the last 2 years, COVID-19 proved the resiliency of VICI's business model because COVID proved the resiliency of our tenants' business models. VICI collected 100% of our rent in cash and on time throughout the COVID-19 crisis because of the operating excellence and operating liquidity of our tenants. Our operators have shown their ability to operate through thick and thin. The economic outlook for the next year or 2 may be murky, but we firmly believe that our operators' prepared their operating revenue, cost and liquidity models for whatever may be coming. What about our view on VICI's ability to continue to grow in the coming period? There are 5 key capabilities as we see it to growing as a net lease REIT in all cycles, including whatever cycle may be about doing 2. Number one, same-store NOI growth based on key lease terms regarding escalation and CPI protection; number two, internal funding capability based on cash retention; number three, the capability and opportunity to invest incrementally in existing assets and return for incremental rent; number four, the ability to source acquisitions when the frequency and intensity of asset marketing processes lessen; number five, access to investment-grade credit when high-yield markets may be constricted or costly. Let me say a few words about VICI's growth capabilities in each of these 5 areas: point number one, same-store NOI growth. Green Street in the September 2021 analysis showed that VICI generates same-store NOI growth more than 4x higher than net lease rates on average. And in terms of higher -- in times, sorry, of higher inflation, VICI's same-store NOI superiority versus other net lease rates expand when factoring in the CPI owned into our leases. Point number two, internal funding capability. Pro forma for the annualization of VICI's net income and debt service, having enclosed Venetian and MGP, if we maintain a dividend payout ratio between 75% and 80%, that would leave between $400 million to $500 million of retained earnings available to us for investment annually, a competitive advantage during periods when market may be constricted. Point number three, investing incrementally in existing property in return for incremental rent. Our assets measure, on average, over 2.5 million square feet and sit on many acres of land. That scale of building and land enable us to invest incrementally in our existing properties in ways generally not available to net lease REITs whose stores generally average around 25,000 square feet, 1/100 the size of our assets. Point number four, sourcing acquisitions when asset marketing processes lessen. You've heard us say before that we grow our business at VICI and our portfolio by growing our relationships. As we pursue both gaming and non-gaming investments in the coming years outside of marketing processes, we are confident that our ability to generate new relationships with operators who operate in net lease white space will give us growth advantages. Point number five, in -- just to investment grade with high-yield credit markets tighten. Through the great work of David Kieske, Erin Ferreri and other members of our finance team, we achieved investment-grade status with S&P and Fitch about 2 weeks ago. We may be in the early stages of a challenging period for the high-yield credit markets and CMBS financing. We believe that the relative competitiveness and attractiveness of our capital could increase during the coming period as experiential operators look to refinance their existing businesses and/or fund their growth initiatives. To sum up, VICI has gotten bigger and moreover stronger at a -- we believe advantages will accrue to those REITs that are bigger and stronger.  I'll now turn the call over to John, who will talk about our new portfolio and operating conditions and to David, who will talk about our financial results and balance sheet upgrade. John? John, you want to start? Tony, I'll just add to that. I think sort of a truism across every real estate asset class that there are benefits in owning marquee assets that are well known to whatever category or well known within whatever category you're in because it increases your visibility. And we were fairly invisible when we got going 4.5 years ago. And there is no question that in owning assets like Caesars Palace Las Vegas, like The Venetian, like MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, like National Harbor, like Caesars New Orleans, we are teaming a visibility that is very, very helpful, as John points out, and giving us greater top-of-mind status when people think about who they'll call. David, do you want to start with answering the second half of Tony's question and then John can add. Tony, I just want to add one more thing. And that is that we -- often in the early years, we're often told by would be partners that, oh, I can borrow money cheaper than your money, VICI. And we are very humble about admitting. We are learning every day how to tell our story better. And what we've really focused on of late is helping people understand that our capital and the cost of it should not be compared simply to the cost of their debt, but to their blended cost of capital, accounting for both the cost of their debt and the cost of their equity. And even before we saw the recent widening of credit spreads and before we saw the recent multiple contraction of many operators across experiential both gaming and non-gaming, our cost of capital versus their blended cost of capital is already very attractive. It's only grown more attractive in the last couple of months. David, do you want to take that? John? One point answer that Spenser that I'd like to add -- Spenser I was just going to say one more point I want to add on top of what John just rightly said, is that with all the focus on inflation, I think it's important to note that, obviously, we, VICI, enjoy superior CPI protection in our leases versus other triple nets. But I also want to make sure everyone understands that our tenants are in the business of nightly leases, and in some cases, even hourly leases, and that pertains to their ability to constantly reprice in respect to demand and in respect to inflation. And I think that, going back to John's point, is a key factor in ensuring they continue to produce all the margin dollars they can possibly produce given their ability based on nightly -- the lease business to constantly reprice. Yes. It's a very, very good and very timely question, Smedes. In my experience, and I guess this is one of these rare occasions when it actually pays to get old, what I've seen over the years is it when you enter a period of tightening, when the cost of credit and/or equity go up, it usually takes sellers longer to recognize the change in reality than does it for the buyers, right? And so I think right now, we're probably in somewhat of a situation of a slack tide where there's really -- on the part of would be sellers or would be buyers a bit of hesitancy as to well, what is market, right? We are fortunate that we have a number of discussions going on that have a momentum to them that can carry both us and our potential partners past this hesitation regarding the future cost of capital. But I do think we'll probably see a period as we have in so many cycles where it will take some time for buyers and sellers to recalibrate. It will take some time to re-find equilibrium, but it's pretty axiomatic that if the cost and the availability of capital goes up, so -- sorry, the cost of capital goes up and the availability goes down, cap rates tend to go up accordingly. Now -- sorry to go on so long. In gaming, it may end up adding to somewhat of a more or less a stasis in cap rates because this is a category that as you were saying, Smedes, has been seeing cap rate compression, perhaps the velocity of compression slows or maybe even stops, but it may be a category where you won't see cap rate expansion given the increasing interest in the category as we've seen over the last year or 2. I would say generally not. And if I guess at what might underlie your question, given that VICI has gotten so big, will VICI sort of establish a red line below which we do not go in terms of asset size or NOI. And I think the answer is no. Again, as a triple net REIT, we enjoy rent per asset that's up over $50 million. The average triple net store produces about $250,000 a year rent. We will always evaluate the materiality of a given asset not unto itself, but really as part of a larger relationship with whomever may either currently own and want a sale leaseback that asset or an operator with whom we partner in the acquisition of that asset. So we will be much more focused on the long-term growth potential of a given category or opportunity or partnership than we would on individual assets. And that's how we believe over time, we'll develop a more sustained and sustainable business model of deal flow. David, you want to take that? David, do you want to take that? Jay, I will just add that a bit of wisdom that one of our most important and valuable Board members, who many of you know, Craig Macnab, one of the first adages he shared with us is that gentleman, the rent should be as low as possible. And we absolutely believe in that. We want our rent to be as low as possible in regard to the economics of the tenant's business because the lower the rent as a percentage of their economics, the more successful they will be, the better at credit they will be and the more willing and able they will be to occupy the building for a very, very long time to come. David? David, do you want to start? And... David Katz, I would just.... Yes, David Katz, I was just going to add that when we look at retained cash as a capital source. We are very cognizant that is the shareholders' money and our obligation to produce a superior return and investment spread on the use of that cash is every bit as strong as it would be if we're going out into the market raising equity. Yes. I'd say, John, we're very confident of that. Are we not? Well, Greg always been good to talk to you, and you definitely get the award at least so far for asking the questions that we can and will not answer on this call.

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. The first 4 months of 2022 were very productive for VICI. In February, we completed The Venetian Las Vegas transaction. And just last week, as Ed noted, we closed on the acquisition of MGP adding 15 Class A market-leading assets with over 33,000 hotel rooms, 3.6 million square feet of convention space and hundreds of food and beverage outlets to our portfolio. As a management team, having the opportunity to acquire the MGP portfolio in a master lease structured where the cash flow is cross-collateralized with inflation protection beginning in lease year 11 and a corporate guarantee from MGM Resorts is something we are very proud to have accomplished on behalf of our shareholders. Our 43 asset portfolio is unmatched in size, scope and quality in the triple net sector, and we plan to continue to grow our asset base with our best-in-class tenant roster as well as new operators. As some of you may know from recent data that has been released, Las Vegas continues to be a top destination choice by consumers and the Las Vegas Strip remains one of the most economically productive streets in the world. Gaming revenue in Las Vegas in March alone came in at $746 million, approximately 35% above 2019 levels. I'm going to repeat that, approximately 35% above 2019 levels. Additionally, the outlook for room revenue is very strong as midweek business continues to normalize with convention business returning to the city. On their first quarter earnings call, both MGM and Caesars cited 90% hotel occupancy in March and Las Vegas room rate surveys published by the Sell Side have pointed to second quarter ADRs that are tracking 30% above 2019 levels. The City of Las Vegas with its diversified entertainment economy that is no longer just about gambling, but centered around business, sports, and entertainment, continues to prove to be the top destination in the U.S. and possibly the world. As a real estate investment trust in the business of owning and leasing integrated entertainment resorts within a triple-net structure, we are big believers in Las Vegas for decades to come and are incredibly excited to now own 10 world-class assets and a total of 660 acres along the Las Vegas Strip. Our regional casino assets with regional markets in general also remained extremely healthy. In case you somehow missed the first 4 months of 2022, I'll give you the cliff note version. In a nutshell, the casino industry is in amazing shape right now. Several operators, including Boyd Gaming, Churchill Downs, MGM and Caesars have made it quite clear with their quarter 1 earnings releases and conference calls that the reports of the decline of the U.S. regional casino margins have been greatly exaggerated. April results have continued the March strength and not only is the gaming consumer healthy, wealthy and wise, they are still choosing to spend money on gambling despite having many other entertainment options. As we think about what comes next for VICI, we are fortunate to have executed some of the largest and most complex transactions in the net lease industry, and we will continue working relentlessly to execute compelling opportunities that deliver accretive value for our shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results, our balance sheet and our guidance. David? Sure. Well, Tony, thanks for the comments, and it's always nice to hear from you. There's no doubt, Tony, that we've changed quite a bit as a company from when we started the company back in 2017 just due to size, scale, scope, magnitude of assets, and it has got the attention of folks that I think when we started the company, did not know exactly who we were and what we were doing. So the funnel is definitely as wide as it's ever been for us. There are numerous opportunities. You've heard us talk about, obviously, gaming opportunities, we'll continue to pursue in markets where we want to own more real estate or we don't own real estate. And then there are a lot of companies that have noticed what we've done in the experiential space. You've heard Ed and David and myself, Danny, others talk about making real estate investments outside of gaming and in experiential and we've been in contact with. And so as Ed in his comments, we build relationships, and we build relationships that we hope turn into real estate ownership. And so we are organizing, we're meeting, we're traveling. We're doing all that right now, Tony. And we'll see how it plays into our growth, but we feel really good about the magnitude of opportunities that we see in front of us. As it pertains to the Mirage, Tony, the Hard Rock team is going through the licensing process in the state of Nevada. They're amazing developers and operators. And we obviously are already partners with them in our Cincinnati asset. And so we're excited with what they are going to have planned for the redevelopment of the Mirage and the Hard Rock Las Vegas. But no timing yet as they need to go through that process. Yes, Spenser. As you -- as it pertains to the ROFRs, I assume you're referring to the Las Vegas ROFR. I'll just refer you to the CEO of Caesars, Tom Reeg, who during his earnings call was very clear on what is going on, which he said, look, Caesars has started the process in early '22. He expects there to be another update by the middle of the summer, and the sales process really is governed by the VICI agreement documents. And so that process is in the works. We're aware of the agreements we have with them. Today, as I said in my opening remarks, we do own 10 great assets on The Strip in Las Vegas, which make up about 600 -- we also have 660 acres that those assets sit on as well as vacant land. It is a market that is truly incredible. As I stated, when you have business up 35% gaming revenues is simply amazing, and it really is as their new ad campaign says the greatest arena on earth. And so that is a market that we are big fans of. We'll continue to study. Do we want to own additional real estate? If we do, it needs to come to us in a very accretive manner. And we'll continue to follow our process on that. Yes. It's another good question, and many have released their earnings. I just -- a friendly reminder that for us, rent is paid with margin dollars not necessarily not margin percentage points. So, if you take a company like one of our tenants, Penn, which generated almost $50 million more in margin dollars year-over-year with the earnings that just came out. So the businesses continue to be incredibly strong, especially when you compare it to other businesses around the United States. So we couldn't be happier. As Ed said in his comments about our tenants, how they've adjusted their business, how their margins are up. Most importantly, their margin dollars are up. Many are seeing record EBITDA. I think Caesars announced that 18 properties set all-time records in Q run EBITDA. So Spenser, I could go on and on about our tenant's bit. It's exciting to see that the -- even with the macro issues going on, they are about continuing to perform very well. Yes. I mean based on what we've heard, we now have Caesars, MGM and The Venetian running assets in Las Vegas who run the largest convention business there that they are seeing that business planning to return later this year and very strong, as you've heard them say in their earnings in 2023. Smedes I was quoting the gaming revenue, but what I haven't quoted yet is another thing Caesars said in their earnings, their Las Vegas properties in the month of April had record room revenue. So that's pretty amazing in a place where they're also getting strong gaming revenue. So you can see the consumer, I mean, most importantly for our tenants, the consumer simply has not found a substitute for their entertainment dollars, that Vegas continues to be, again, the #1 destination in America. I've argued with my colleagues, it's the number one destination in the world right now. And not only is the customer coming who wants to gamble, but we're seeing that they diversified these resorts, and they're getting business travel. They're getting room revenue, they're getting food and beverage revenues, spa revenue, pool revenue. And it's the beauty of these integrated resorts. And all the credit goes to our operators and how they're running these facilities. I'll go ahead and jump in. I mean, obviously, we've seen with the Wind transaction in Boston Realty Income getting into the casino space. But for us, ever since we started the company, we always knew there was going to be competition in this space. Clearly, people have seen the resiliency of the model. They've seen the high quality of the assets. They've seen how it's performed in the toughest time ever, which was COVID with the business shutdown and rebounding with all the records that I've been talking about today. So that obviously has attracted more potential owners of the real estate or of the holdco as you mentioned. So we go into every transaction, expecting that there's going to be competition. And we are not surprised at all that there are more folks that are interested in this just incredible real estate space. We are. We are. Obviously, David can't tell you when our next transaction, Sam's smiling at me -- that I can't tell you when our next transaction will be. But in all seriousness, I -- we're as -- you've heard me say, we're as busy as we've ever been. The funnel is wider than it's ever been for numerous reasons that we talked about earlier of our size, our scope. And so I think that's very realistic within the next year or so. Couldn't agree more. Yes. Just as a reminder, we have really 34 acres in Las Vegas that are underdeveloped, 7 are in front of Caesars Palace. Those -- that sits inside the Las Vegas master lease, and then there are an incremental 27 acres that we own. Caesars also owns some acreage next to our 27 acres. As it pertains to development, as you can imagine, as you -- and you are alluding to or as you mentioned, there have been some significant sales of real estate acreage on the Las Vegas Strip or near the Las Vegas Strip. It continues to make our land very valuable. And the process would work if we were to develop would be with Caesars on the land, particularly in front of Caesars Palace as well as the land that is behind The Flamingo, behind Paris and Bally's. We would work in partnership with them should there be an appropriate development. But we sure do like the prices that are coming out, if they are completely true. I think there was one that just took place, small acreage of almost over $30 million an acre. So we're excited to see that. And it's not that surprising when you heard the statistics. I went through in my opening remarks about this city and the success of these resorts and how the operators have turned them into incredible places of EBITDA generation."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. I'll start with our balance sheet. At the beginning of 2022, encapsulates the energy we have brought to transforming our balance sheet since VICI emerged in October 2017. We have discussed this relentless balance sheet focus with you over the last 4.5 years. We believe it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners to -- deserve. Not to spend too much time on 2021, but is a good reminder of how we take the long-term view to safeguard our company. We raised a combined total of $5.4 billion of equity at the time of the announcement of The Venetian acquisition and shortly after the announcement of the MGP transaction. These equity offerings derisk the equity funding well ahead of closing on our $21 billion of announced acquisitions and allowed us to repay all of our secured debt last September. These actions set us up for success in early 2022 and for years to come. On February 8, we closed on our new $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $1 billion delayed draw term loan, increasing overall liquidity with highly efficient bank capital. On February 23, we closed on the $4 billion acquisition of Venetian through the settlement of 2 outstanding forwards, bringing 119 million shares onto the balance sheet for total proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion. We also drew $600 million on our revolver, and used cash on hand to fund The Venetian. On April 18, VICI's debt rating was upgraded to BBB- by S&P and Fitch, greatly broadening our access to permanent debt capital. On April 20, we priced $5 billion of investment-grade senior unsecured notes, executing on the largest REIT investment-grade bond offering ever. The blended cash interest rate for the senior unsecured notes was 5%. The effective interest rate after taking into account our hedge portfolio, which was comprised of $2.5 billion in notional amount of forward starting swaps and $500 million in notional amount of treasury locks is 4.51%. On April 29, we closed on the acquisition of MGP as well as a $5 billion bond offering. We used $4.404 billion of the bond offering proceeds to fund our redemption of a majority of MGM's MGP OP units. Following the MGP acquisition, the company has approximately 963 million shares of common stock outstanding and VICI OP has 12.2 million additional OP units outstanding held by MGM that were received in the merger. The remaining proceeds from the bond offering plus cash on hand were used to repay the $600 million outstanding under VICI's revolving credit facility. In terms of leverage, we ended Q1 2022 with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.6x. This highlights the fact that we significantly over-equitized the balance sheet ahead of the closing of the MGP acquisition, positioning our balance sheet to raise the incremental debt to complete the funding and bringing on the associated income with that transaction. As we sit here today, pro forma for the MGP transaction, we have total debt of $15.5 billion, inclusive of our pro rata share of the BREIT JV debt on a run rate net debt to adjusted EBITDA -- excuse me, on a run rate, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.8x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 8.4 years to maturity. Just touching on the income statement. AFFO for the first quarter was $305.5 million or $0.44 per share. Total AFFO in Q1 2022 increased 19.8% year-over-year, while AFFO per share increased approximately 5.1% over the prior year. The disparity between overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count. Our fully diluted share count increased approximately 26.3% primarily as a result of the regular weight portion of the September 2021 equity offering, which added 65 million shares to our balance sheet, the settlement of the June 2020 forward sale agreement last September, which added 26.9 million shares to our balance sheet and the settlement of the March and September 4 sale agreements in February of 2022, which added 119 million shares to our balance sheet. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $9.5 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 2.3%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple net sector. Turning to guidance. We are updating our AFFO guidance for 2022 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activities or other nonrecurring transactions. And as we have discussed in the past, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. Our guidance incorporates the recently closed MGP acquisition, including the issuance of 214.5 million shares of common stock to former MGP stockholders and the $5 billion bond offering we executed subsequent to quarter end. We expect AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2022 will be between $1.66 billion and $1.69 billion or between $1.89 and $1.92 per diluted share. With that, operator, we ask you to please open up the line for questions. Sure. We -- look, we're very cognizant of the macro trends, right? We were fortunate to get our bond offering off a couple of weeks ago just -- and execute what we were able to execute. Every day brings something new volatility with the Fed speak yesterday. So we're going to work to ensure that our partner property growth loan is ultimately what we're talking about here, delivers accretive returns. And that's -- I touched on that being able to invest in these magnificent assets of size, scale and complexity that rivals nothing other out there. We will make sure that the capital that we deployed generates an incremental return that's accretive to us. Yes. Tony, I mean, ultimately, we're solving for a spread to our cost of capital. And like every deal is different. Obviously, inflation and CPI discussions are more relevant today than they were when we started VICI. But ultimately, as a net lease company delivering an attractive 100 basis points, 150 basis points, sometimes less, sometimes more spread to our cost of capital is what we strive for. We also look at our underwriting in terms of cash-on-cash returns and the IRR over a period of time to ensure that we are delivering incremental accretive deals to our shareholders. Yes. Jay, thanks for the question. I mean as I mentioned a little bit earlier, each deal is unique and not every -- not one size fits all. So what is critical for us is that any transaction that we ultimately underwrite and ultimately announce and then sign up is accretive day 1, right? You saw some hotel REITs in the last day or 2 announced a 4 cap and they're going to turn it into an 8 or 9 yield. We can't do that under our structure. And if we ever did that, that would probably be our last deal that we ever did. So obviously, CPI is a very hot topic these days, but it's important for us to have escalators that are: one are reasonable for the market that we're in, whether that's regional, super regional, Vegas destination and then annual bumps that work for us and work for the operator. And we ultimately want to push for no CPI caps and the operators are pushing back on that a little bit. And so it's always a negotiation in terms of value, duration of lease the cap rate that we can pay. There's a few levers that we underwrite with to make sure that we are underwriting a strong credit and a strong operator that has conviction that coming into the market. But obviously, we want to -- our fundamental goal is to make sure that we -- what we sign up is accretive from day 1 because we live with that for 30 years plus. Yes, Jay. I mean we're thrilled to be here, and we'll continue to, as we talked about on the debt roadshow and the debt marketing process, we'll continue to migrate up to BBB curve over time. We'll continue to diversify our tenants, bring our leverage back to the 5x and 5.5x that we've always been very focused on from day 1. Thanks to Erin's great work with the -- Erin Ferreri and her team. Thanks to her great work with the agencies, we're able to get that rating upgrade on April 18. But that does definitely broaden the funnel as another question that was asked earlier. At the end of the day, we're spread investing. So if we can lower our cost of capital, not only through the debt markets and as we migrate up the credit curve, obviously, the cost of capital can be reduced. And then with the index inclusion that has occurred with the MGP Class A shareholders being converted to VICI Class -- to VICI shareholders and then potentially one day S&P 500 inclusion, we can continue to lower our cost of equity capital to -- as you said, Jay, and frankly, so broaden that funnel and continue to diversify both in and outside of gaming. As Ed mentioned, and we've talked about our free cash flow after dividends and that's true free cash flow is somewhere $400 million to $500 million of run rate. So you kind of think about levering that 1:1 up to $1 billion of buying power. And so small gaming deals like the Century deal that we announced in June of '19, $278 million that can be done with cash on hand. And so all that accretion dropped straight to the bottom line. And some of the non-gaming stuff that you see us do is obviously smaller just by the opportunities that were presented in front of us at the time. And so those -- that's free cash flow. We don't have to go to the equity markets and do what we did last year and raise $5.4 billion of equity for the transformations that we undertook. We're thrilled to have done them, and we wouldn't know looking back. But I think as we continue to grow, as Ed said, that's sustained and sustainable flow business as you'll see more of that going forward. Hopefully that answers your question, David. Hey, Greg, it's David. Similar to but not including unannounced acquisitions or dispositions or capital markets activities, guidance includes this, the base case escalators. It doesn't include any CPI, estimates around CPI because that's a guessing game, and so we can't predict the future. If we could, we'd probably be doing something else. So the base rate in the leases that's in the guidance number. Yes. For the bump in November, we look at September, August and July numbers and compare that to the prior year, and then that's what gets factored into the increase November 1. For the 2 Caesars leases, the Caesars master lease and the Caesars Las Vegas lease."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the VICI Properties Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, February 23, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial condition. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, in our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to, Ed.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start this morning with a few words about 2023 VICI accomplishments and the way forward. John Payne, will share our 2024 growth approach, and David Kieske will discuss our 2023 financial results and our 2024 guidance. Last night, we announced final 2023 AFFO per share of $2.15 representing year-over-year per share growth of 11.8%. VICI's 2023 AFFO growth will likely make VICI one of the 2023 income growth leaders among the 29 S&P 500 REITs that report AFFO per share. There are 30 S&P 500 REITs overall, representing approximately 90% of the U.S. REIT equity market capitalization at year-end. VICI's 2023 growth is largely the result of work we did in 2022, forging new relationships and new investments in both gaming and non-gaming both property acquisitions and property credit investments. I'm proud of our 2023 AFFO per share growth, but I'm also proud of what the VICI team did in 2023 to continue to produce growth for 2024 and beyond. Our investment activities in 2023 produce growth in our portfolio quality, geographic diversity, tenant diversity, and income. Indeed, when it comes to 2024 income growth, as David will discuss in a moment regarding our 2024 guidance, we expect our projected 2024 AFFO per share growth should put VICI well into the top half of the S&P 500 REIT 2024 AFFO per share growth table. It wasn't easy to produce future growth in 2023. It was tough to navigate in 2023. Most days in 2023 and frankly most days in 2024 so far remind me of my days living and working in Whistler, British Columbia, where our very challenging coastal mountain environment could result in days so foggy and whited out that we describe such days as skiing inside a milk bottle. But even amidst this low visibility, the VICI team kept pioneering in 2023. We invested in new geographies, including three new countries, and through our Bowlero acquisition in U.S. non-commercial gaming states such as Texas, California, and North Carolina. We invested in new categories such as family recreation and youth sports. We expanded our partnerships with pilgrimage brands like Cabot and Canyon Ranch. We acquired the primary leasehold interest in New York's incomparable Chelsea Piers. Through our position as the leading owner of real estate on the Las Vegas Strip, we continue to work with our Las Vegas partners to capitalize on Las Vegas' leadership position in global entertainment and hospitality. I strongly believe VICI's investment in Las Vegas is one of the most compelling investments in the current global commercial real estate investing landscape. As we set out in our earnings release last night, in 2023, we announced and closed $1.8 billion of capital acquisitions and investments within the year. Note that these figures do not include the $2.8 billion closing of our Mandalay Bay MGM Grand joint venture in early January 2023, which we announced in early December 2022, including our assumption of the remaining $1.5 billion of CMBS debt. A fundamental importance, our 2023 investing in gaming and non-gaming was accretive. Our announced 2023 capital investments were made at a blended initial unlevered investment yield of 7.7%. Our 2023 investing was also balance sheet enhancing. We funded this $1.8 billion of investment with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and equity and only about $200 million of incremental debt, achieving an equity-to-debt funding ratio on that investment activity of 8:1, demonstrating our commitment to our long range net leverage target of 5.0 times to 5.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As we look ahead within 2024, despite the continued cloudy macroeconomic conditions and outlook, we begin 2024 with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and forward equity resources to deploy into continuing accretive growth. Needless to say, in a macro environment of constrained capital conditions, we believe our capital resources can and will be attractive to gaming and experiential operators who want to grow and/or need liquidity. Finally, in 2024, we will continue to build a portfolio of quality. You've heard me say before that I believe VICI is the pioneer in bringing Class A real estate to net lease. By Class A, we mean real estate of great scale, great quality and high mission criticality. And VICI enables investors to own Class A real estate within the strong economic transparency and integrity of the net lease model. What we can, must, and will do is continue to enable existing and potential VICI investors to understand fully the scale, quality and mission criticality of our Class A real estate. To that end, we are proud to announce that we're launching today the VICI Properties photo book, a digital coffee table style book that brings to life the magnificence of the real estate owned by VICI. You can view this book online at our website, www.viciproperties.com. And I thank Hayes Honea of our team for her great work in producing and publishing this book. I strongly encourage you to give this book a good viewing. If you're a VICI shareholder, I believe the book will give you great pride in what you own. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to, John.\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. In 2023, VICI was able to navigate a volatile broader market backdrop, particularly for REITs and consistently deployed capital in accretive manners throughout the year. Over the course of 2023, we deployed $1.8 billion at a blended yield of approximately 7.7% across investments that expanded our geographic reach domestically and internationally, broadened our investable universe across gaming, hospitality and family entertainment, and deepened our ability to invest creatively through property related credit investments. Our ability to transact successfully last year was due in part to the multi-year effort I've mentioned before on our earnings calls. Every day at VICI, our team shows up for work and focuses on developing and maintaining relationships with best-in-class growth oriented operators, while some REITs describes themselves simply as a landlord and position themselves to extract value from their tenants. We view ourselves as a long-term capital partner collaborating with our tenants to create value. This philosophy of serving as a capital partner and prioritizing relationships with operators who pursue growth energetically serves as our compass as we assess and underwrite opportunities in the current environment, an environment that is characterized by low visibility and fluctuating cost of capital. To that end, many of you have heard me speak over the years about our focus on growth and it's also important to understand that there have been numerous situations in which we elect to not pursue opportunities. VICI is in the very fortunate position to have created significant shareholder value over the years. For example, we've grown our AFFO per share at 8.5% CAGR from 2018 through 2023, while our dividend has grown at a comparable high-single-digit rate and we do not believe we need to pursue growth surely for the sake of growing. For those of you who may be newer to our story, I would like to touch on a few elements of our growth pillars that have allowed us to successfully complete $36 billion of accretive transaction volume in a little over six years. Number 1, we work collaboratively with operating partners investing in growth opportunities and funding high ROI capital projects in order to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Number 2, as the only S&P 500 REIT predominantly invested in the gaming industry, given 90% of our rent roll is derived from gaming investments, our team travels far and wide, visiting properties, studying new markets, assessing the landscape and meeting with operators across regional, Las Vegas and even international locations. Number 3, we are supplementing our gaming investments with opportunities in experiential sectors that we believe are positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds. We focus on sourcing transaction with operators who are positioning themselves for growth, including through roll-up in an industry much as you saw with our Cabot and Bowlero transactions announced in October of last year. And finally, number 4, we constantly keep our eyes open for opportunities where VICI can get better by getting bigger as demonstrated through the acquisition of MGM Growth Properties in 2022, which significantly expanded our footprint in Las Vegas, added Class A market leading regional assets to our portfolio, improved our balance sheet to investment grade and has positioned us for a long-term partnership with MGM Resorts, a world class gaming, hospitality, and leisure operator. As we dive further into 2024, we hold firm to the criteria that has driven much of our track record to-date while executing across our strategic pillars. In particular, we are adhering to prudent underwriting standards, ensuring your capital is appropriately compensated as we assess risk and pursue opportunities across different properties, markets and asset classes. And as I said earlier, we maintain a preference for growth focused operators with our entire team evaluating a partner's track record and importantly, their use of proceeds, which typically explains intentions behind pursuing a transaction. We ultimately believe the right partnerships lead to the right opportunities, which feeds the flywheel of value creation through collaboration. We believe our commitment to developing and deepening relationship with great operators of all shapes and sizes combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will afford us the ability to continue executing accretive deals during a time when other REITs may be stuck \u201cskiing inside a milk bottle.\u201d Now, I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thank you, John. It's great to speak with everyone today and we appreciate your time. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2023 exemplifies the continued discipline we have maintained over our six plus years of existence by ensuring that we allocate capital accretively, have a balance sheet and liquidity profile designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. During the year, we raised over $1.6 billion in forward equity. In January of 2023, we raised approximately a $1 billion in gross forward equity proceeds at a $33 price per share. Those proceeds were used throughout the year to accretively fund our transactions. We utilized our ATM program throughout 2023 raising $643 million in gross forward proceeds. That amount includes $390 million which was raised in Q4 through the sale of 13.2 million shares via the forward and remains outstanding today. And subsequent to year-end in Q1 2024, we sold 9.7 million shares raising $306 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward. This brings our total outstanding forward equity to just under $700 million bolstering our overall liquidity. Currently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $523 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, $696 million of proceeds under our outstanding forwards and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we begin 2024, we believe we're extremely well-positioned to navigate the current environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital as we sit here today. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA annualized for a full-year of activity from our recent acquisitions and excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity is approximately 5.5 times within our target leverage range. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35% taking into account our hedge portfolio that we utilized in connection with our April 2022 inaugural investment grade offering in a weighted average 5.9 years to maturity. As of December 31, we've entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swap agreements ahead of our May 1, $1.05 billion bond maturity, which has an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. This portfolio has an effective treasury rate of 4.04%. Just touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 8.8% compared to $0.51 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For the full-year 2023, AFFO per share was $2.15 an increase of 11.8% compared to $1.93 for the full-year 2022, and as Ed mentioned, making VICI one of the leaders across the S&P 500 REITs. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $15.3 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%. This continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple-net sector but across all REITs. Turning to our guidance. And as you saw in our release last night, we are initiating AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to be between $2.32 billion $2.355 billion or between $2.22 per share $2.25 per share. Based on the midpoint of our 2024 guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4%, very attractive starting point as we begin 2024. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced, but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other non-recurring transaction or items. And as we've mentioned previously, we record a non-cash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Paolon with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolon: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I guess my first question is just whether or not you could put some dimensions around your deal pipeline right now, either whether it's skewed somewhere geographically, size and maybe yields?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: I'll start, Tony, and good morning. Good to speak with you and then John and David can kick in. I would say that in the spirit of our opening remarks, we're obviously sober as you've heard from other REITs in recent weeks like [agri] (ph) and realty income. We're sober about the marketplace. We're sober about the capital markets and we're pretty sober about what kind of activity may be available to us. And yet having said that, John and the team continue to work the trap lines in such a way that we have a number of conversations going on both in gaming and non-gaming that have us very excited and John can talk about that in a moment. The other point I want to emphasize, Tony, is that the magnitude of what we own brings with it opportunities you wouldn't necessarily find in other REITs given the nature of the property they own, especially when we look at Las Vegas, where we've got, I think John, 40,000 odd hotel rooms. If you look just at an asset like The Venetian, which including parking is 17 million square feet, given what's going on there, given the impact of this sphere, the opportunity of Patrick and Nicole and the team to continue to asset manage, maximize the productivity of that asset is so, so strong. I mean, it's a magnitude of building. And again, this goes back to my opening remarks that we are going to continue to help the investment marketplace understand the magnitude of building such that there are 300,000 square feet inside the 17 million square feet that have never gone past the concrete stage, concrete floors, concrete walls, concrete ceilings 300,000 unfinished square feet. And with the job that the team at the Venetian is doing to maximize that asset, especially taking advantage of this sphere, that represents incremental investment opportunity or growth opportunity for us that you wouldn't likely find in most other REITs generally and certainly not in triple-net lease REITs generally which tend to have assets of 10,000 square feet not 17 million square feet. But John, you want to add to this?\nJohn Payne: Tony, you can hear from Ed's comments. He spent some time in Las Vegas recently, which I have as well. You asked a question about what sectors and I also think what locations. We obviously have been spending a lot of time in Las Vegas. We're very proud of our partners' success there and it looks like 2024 is going to be a great year as well. And as you heard from my remarks, we continue to look at different target sectors whether in wellness and indoor waterparks, pilgrimage golf, family entertainment center. We made our first investment in youth sports, which we like the mixed use of youth sports. So, I continue to spend my time with my team and really the whole company looking at a variety of these and checking the boxes of which ones could make for long-term investments. And there are some sectors that we don't talk about that we've kind of checked off the list that says this is not right for our capital at this time. But we shouldn\u2019t confuse that the casino business continues to be real focus of our company and one that we are just can't be more proud of the operators and what they've done in \u201823 and what we see in \u201824.\nAnthony Paolon: Okay. Thanks. And then just I have one kind of detailed follow-up, maybe for David because I was asked this a couple of times overnight. Just in your guidance, like how do you, just remind us how you're treating like the forward equity in the guidance share count, like what goes in there or not?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Tony, there's no implied use of proceeds or drawdown. There's a little bit of impact from treasury stock dilution in the ultimate share count, but that's the only impact.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Okay. Another way of putting it, Tony, is we're not assuming any credit or horsepower from the funding and we're taking actually a marginal penalty by virtue of having it on our well, we technically, we don't have it on our balance sheet, but given the treasury stock method.\nAnthony Paolon: Okay. Understand. Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBarry Jonas: Hey, guys. Good morning. Wanted to start with the, the Caesars center call option. Can you maybe just walk through different considerations as you're thinking about exercising it and specifically timing of that? Thanks.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Well, clearly, Barry, we want to be as opportunistic as we can be within our timing given the inherent nature of a call option. And obviously, that timing will be predicated on what our cost of funding is. And I don't think it would come as any surprise to anybody that we certainly would not choose to exercise our call option if in doing so we were creating dilution, which we don't ever want to do. And so, going back to the theme of, skiing inside a milk bottle, the visibility through 2024 given its current state is such that it's hard to predict with any kind of exactitude exactly when the right time would be.\nBarry Jonas: Got it. Got it. And then, Ed, maybe just more a higher level question. You've done deals with tribes, native American tribes on commercial land before, but I was hoping you could talk more about the puts and takes with doing some type of deal structure in tribal land. There's clear risks there, but it's something banks and debt investors have been able to overcome. And, I think it's a sizable market with clear financing needs? Thanks.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start and I'll turn it over to John. Barry, I read the notes from that recent session you had, which were really interesting to read. I know one of the participants in your session sounded rather, I won't say bullish, but seemed to say that there may be means to do it. I will tell you with complete candor, we haven't exactly figured out how that would work yet, John, right?\nJohn Payne: But Barry, you touched on, we've been really excited to build relationships with three tribes in the commercial sector and it's something that we can continue to talk with them and other tribal partners that we've gotten to know to see could there be an opportunity to help them grow on their nation's land. But we have primarily been focused with our partners on the commercial sector and we'll continue to study that opportunity because as Ed said, we saw the study of the report that came out as well.\nBarry Jonas: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess you guys have made it clear that a significant part of your business could be repeat business. So, can you talk about maybe the pipeline and if we should see some repeat business in 2024 and or continue to see new operator partners pop up?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Good morning, Caitlin. Very good question you asked. No question that we continue to meet with our 13 partners currently in gaming and non-gaming and talk about how our capital can help them grow over the coming years. And as Ed alluded to, the boxes that are in I shouldn't even call them boxes in Las Vegas, the amazing resorts we own with partners in Las Vegas could provide with a lot of opportunity in the relatively near future and in the coming years as those partners look to grow whether that's in hotel rooms, new restaurants, new attractions. Ed mentioned obviously the sphere where that sits on our land. We weren't involved in the building or they're not our direct tenant. But we see that as a pillar of growth for our company over the coming years, not only in Las Vegas, but in our regional assets because there are large regional assets whether that's the MGM assets in National Harbor or in Detroit, there are opportunities to grow as well. And then I think your second part of the question is, are we looking to continue to expand our tenant roster? And the answer is, absolutely. Me, my team, Ed, David, Sam, anyone else in the company is out, forging new relationships to see if there's new sectors or new companies that we can use our capital to help them grow. So, I wouldn't be surprised if you see some new operators or new tenants in our roster over the coming year.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: And Caitlin, let me just add on to that a little bit. Obviously, there have been questions understandably as to VICI, why don't you just do gaming and only gaming? And as we have emphasized in many, many occasions, we are still for all of the time remaining going to be intensely focused on gaming given what a great business within Wichita real estate. But one of the real benefits of investing in other experiential categories is well, first of all, comes with the fact that it's just fundamentally great real estate occupied by operators who offer very rich and profitable experiences to their end customers. So, that's the fundamental reason to invest in other experiential. It's fundamentally good real estate. The second dimension to that is that, it gives us a chance to grow when growth may not be available for gaming. And related to that, and this goes back to your initial question, Caitlin, one of the advantages we see in experiential operators like a Cabot, like a Canyon Ranch, like a Bowlero, like a Great Wolf, is they have network growth opportunities that are not as readily available to our gaming operators. The nature of growth in new stores and gaming is such that it is always subject to very strict regulatory control. For Cabot, as an example, on the other hand, they have a global growth opportunity that can be seized with great energy and does not suffer the restrictions, or the slowing down of cadence that tends to apply to gaming operators attempting to grow their network other than through M&A.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. No. That makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just back to the pipeline a bit. You guys were active with both sale leasebacks and lending over the past 12 or so months despite a quiet CRE transaction market. And I know you mentioned how you're sober to the current situation, but you guys continue to invest in \u201823. So, I was wondering if you could give some more detail on the pipeline today, maybe size, mix, and how that makes you think more specifically, maybe, like, the first half of \u201824 activity could end up being or what that could be like?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Caitlin, it's David. Great to hear from you. Thanks for joining today. Look, the nature of our capital is relationship capital and it's where we've been active both as you just mentioned on the loan side as well as the sale leaseback side. And it's as, John talked about in his comments, solving our partners objectives and being a source of growth capital. And sometimes that growth capital comes in the door day one, like you saw with our Homefield opportunity where they're building a facility and going to construct a very, very, very attractive experiential both sports and hotel asset, which will lead to a sale leaseback. So, it's we're always out talking about ways that we can help our partners grow and to kind of put it in a percentage basket of X amount of loans and X amount of sale leasebacks. That's just how we look at it or how we kind of parse our pipeline. It's about finding the great partners that we've talked about on this call.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRavi Vaidya: Hi. Good morning. This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. Hope you all are doing well. Just noticed that the mezz lending and construction financing is becoming a larger proportion of your capital deployment strategy. How should we think about the sizing of that relative to your broader acquisition pipeline, and how are you underwriting those return requirements, and how that's changed over the last, six to 12 months? Thanks.\nDavid Kieske: Hey Ravi, it's David. Good to hear from you. I didn\u2019t, clear caught your question. It's how we think about kind of the spread on those mezz loan, especially around development. Look, we always there's a couple of ways that we look at it and it's a little bit more art than science at the end of the day. But what's the cost of the seniors? Is there a senior lender ahead of us? Are we achieving the right risk adjusted spread to the senior? Obviously, what's the duration of our capital? What's the funding cadence of our capital? And then ultimately, what most every lender looks at, what's the equity sponsor and how much equity is in the transaction and ensuring that we are protected from a credit standpoint at the end of the day and feel good about the project.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: And then to go back to the first part of your question, it will always be a minor percentage of our assets under management and we will use it to forge relationships. We have an example obviously right in front of us of using lending to establish a relationship with Chelsea Piers that led to the acquisition of the primary leasehold interest in December. So, we will use it both as a strategic tool to develop relationships and a strategic tool to create a steadier cadence to our capital allocation. We're very proud of the fact that we got capital out the door every single month in 2023. And I can tell you in our early years, there were whole quarters that went by where we did not get capital out the door, given what was true back then, which was that the nature of our capital allocation was big and lumpy, tied to big lumpy gaming acquisitions. So, it is a tool that can generate growth and return on a very steady basis. It is a strategic tool to forge relationships. And again, given some of the spreads we've been able to achieve in recent years, it is very lucrative, very accretive in driving earnings growth. And again, we're about creating earnings growth that others may not be able to achieve if they're not as energetic and pioneering as we have been both in terms of how we grow the business in terms of asset classes and through the use of our balance sheet.\nRavi Vaidya: Got it. That's very helpful. Just one more here. Can you please discuss the opportunity with the Indiana assets? In your view, how attractive is the [7.7] (ph) call in the current market and how does it theoretically fund something like that? Thanks.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. Well, as I said in response to Barry, obviously, 7.7 is not as attractive as when it was struck a few years back when the call agreement was struck a few years back. And it will be a call opportunity. We will be excited about executing if it's an accretive opportunity and if it's not an accretive opportunity. If in fact there would be a dilutive opportunity at 7.7, we would not do it.\nRavi Vaidya: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Darling with Green Street. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris Darling: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just going back to the Caesars call options again, let's just for argument's sake assume that you do exercise those options. I'm just curious. How would you think about the deal structure from a rent coverage standpoint? So I'm wondering, would you possibly structure tighter rent coverage on a standalone basis if it made sense within kind of the larger master lease?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Well, yes, Chris. So, the rent coverage, by virtue of the current call agreement is set, but, it is a subject to discussion, and one we have and would like to continue to explore with Caesars, such that on an overall basis, they and we are at rent coverages that everybody feels really good about for decades to come.\nChris Darling: All right. Fair enough. One more for you. Just touching on the Homefield agreement. Just hoping you can elaborate on the scope of the project, potential future expansion. So, I'm wondering what the total estimated investment is for the current development, how the team is thinking about scaling to additional locations over time and just trying to wrap my arms around what the scope of investment might look like for VICI over time?\nJohn Payne: Yes, Chris, it's John. As when we made the announcement a few months ago, we talked about spending a couple of years studying the youth sports business and we learned a lot in that process. We've also found an amazing partner in Homefield. We announced our first opportunity with them in the Kansas City area and they're building not only the youth sports facility but connected to a Margaritaville Resorts. That's one of the things, I think you'll continue to see is if we place other investments into the youth sports spaces, having numerous cash registers, not just having the fields to rent or the stadiums to rent, but also having connected to one operator who controls the restaurants, who controls the hotel rooms and controls the sports fields. So, this is a $110 millionish initial investment with Homefield. We've not announced any further development not only on that site, which does have opportunity to expand over time, but also other sites around the Midwest or the United States. But as with any partner that we've talked about whether that's with casino partners or with Cabot or Canyon Ranch and now Homefield, we hope that it's not just our only investment with them and we purposely took so much time to study the business to find the right partner to grow.\nChris Darling: I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey. Good morning. So, as you continue to invest in non-gaming assets, how should investors get comfortable with more opaque tenant financials there? And what sort of premium are you receiving from an investment yield standpoint as it compares to a potential gaming investment?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. So, you are right, Greg. If we're partnering with an experiential operator that's not public, the tenant financials are not crystal clear in the same way they're not crystal clear across a whole lot of net lease portfolios. And at the end of the day, we obviously have to exercise our fiduciary responsibility to the greatest degree possible in ensuring that the fundamental business is very, very supportive of the rent and the way in which our operating partners manage their balance sheets and liquidity is also of a strength that ensures that they won't be in positions where they're unable to meet the rent. We've got a very rigorous underwriting practice. We obviously can take advantage of history in many of the categories, experiential categories that we're investing in. And again, at the end of the day, it's up to us to make sure that they are of a strength, that's going to enable them to weather whatever should come their way. But I will also emphasize that our key criteria, our first of four criteria in evaluating all investments, gaming and experiential widely, is that the businesses be of lower than average cyclicality versus consumer discretionary at large, which we think is another risk mitigant when it comes to ensuring that they can cover the rent through thick and thin.\nGreg McGinniss: Just to follow-up on that, in the cases where you're providing construction loans, where may there's not kind of in place cash flows to be underwriting or evaluating. What's the process look like there when you're trying to get comfortable, in terms of lending that money and the ability to recollect in the case that, maybe cash flows don't hit quite the targets that were expected?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Well, last dollar exposure is obviously one of the key criteria and ensuring that our last dollar exposure is at a level whereby if we did end up owning the asset that the operating economics are such that at the last dollar exposure level that we would be lending at, we're still in good shape.\nJohn Payne: Yes, Greg, and then it comes down, as I mentioned, quality of the sponsors, the amount of equities, the overall loan-to-cost or loan-to-value and then the protections that are obviously ultimately documented in our agreements. But a lot of the sectors and we like our sale leaseback investments, we study the sectors. Indoor water parts, we studied for 18 odd months led by certain members of our team and went deep into that sector before we did anything. And so it's getting gaining conviction whether it be through direct real estate ownership or the lending platform that we have of who the operator is, the durability of the sector and then the ultimate protections that we can put in place.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay, thanks. And just a final one for me. And I'd like to preface this question by acknowledging the great work that John and his team have done so far. We know that you've added some great members to the investment team as well. But given your sector low G&A, how do you balance that shareholder friendly expense line versus investing in a larger acquisitions team that could maybe help source and underwrite more investment opportunities?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: No, it's a very fair strategic question, Greg, and it's a question we regularly wrestle with. I would say one of the ways in which we deal with, if you will, the underinvestment risk in G&A is by, I think, having forged some of the strongest partnership relationships of anybody out there. From day one, we have treated our advisors as best as we possibly can. This means the investment banks, the other parties, the real estate advisory firms, such that we are always the first they call when they think there's a compelling opportunity. They are a force multiplier for us. And we have great respect for them. We engage with them intensely. We reward them when they do great work for us. And in the event, we end up saving on G&A, which in an inflationary period has really two benefits, overall low G&A to begin with and less inflationary impact on our G&A load. If it ever gets to the point where we feel we're short changing shareholders by running too thin, we will certainly add resources in the way we've obviously added resources here in the last couple of years. Thank you, Greg, we\u2019ll move on to the next question.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks you, Ed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. I want to get your kind of commentary or thoughts on performance thus far for Fontainebleau. It seems like mainstream media has been favorable on it, but there's also local articles on some management changes there. Just wondering how performance is it?\nJohn Payne: Nick, I won't necessarily talk about the financial performance, but what I will make a comment about is, what a beautiful asset, that was built by the team there, the Coke Industries, the Fontainebleau team, the operating team there that I haven't met anyone that walks through the place and says, oh, this is a, I mean I think most people walk through the place and say, wow, what an amazing place. And I think for those of us who have spent time operating in Las Vegas over the years, it takes time. It takes time to build up a database and it takes time, but they sure do have a facility that I think everyone is proud of and we sure are proud of.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. And Nick, you've given me the opportunity to vent a little bit about how utterly weary I am around the negativity of so much of the media coverage, which regularly gets proven to be way overly negative. Oh my God, this sphere is going to be a disaster. I was in the U.K. earlier this week. I was struck by how many people wanted to talk about this sphere because they'd either already been or they're determined to go. And again, media coverage around that, oh my god. Oh, F1 is going to be a disaster. Well, guess what? It wasn't. The drivers loved it. The teams loved it. It was an amazing weekend of business for our operating partners. So Super Bowl, again, just a phenomenal event for Las Vegas and for the NFL. So, I absolutely agree with you. Some of the press coverage has been quite negative, but we know the people involved, we know how hard they're working, we know how challenging what it is that they've set forth for themselves to open an unaffiliated property on the strip. And yet again, that asset is utterly magnificent and they're doing the right things to bring business to it over time. And with the backing of Coke, you can be sure that the backing is strong enough that they have the patience, but moreover the firepower to make this work in due course.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just I know we've talked a lot on the pipeline and the investment opportunities, kind of the more sober environment out there. But if I just think about kind of the stickiness of cap rates, I mean, where are you seeing the most pricing power expansion where, probably makes a little more sense in today's environment, versus I would imagine some others where it's a bit sick here?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Nick, are you talking about cap rate variability across various experiential asset classes?\nNick Joseph: Exactly.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. I don't know, John and David, I don't know that we've seen a tremendous amount of variability across asset classes. We're obviously not seeing a tremendous amount of trading. And yet you obviously saw with our unlevered 7.7% yield for the $1.8 billion we put out the door in 2023, that we have obviously been able to acquire income at higher yields. I would have a tough time generalizing, but David and John, I don\u2019t know if you want to add.\nDavid Kieske: Yes. I think you covered it well, but Nick, I mean, it's no different than any other asset class that you're in kind of the broader net lease. You have bid ask spreads and buyers obviously willing sorry, sellers' willingness to transact around in a backdrop where there's the volatility and variability that we've talked about. And so, there's opportunity out there, but it's a no difference in the broader CRE market. It's somewhat of a bit of a quieter environment and just an air of caution cautious on both sides until we kind of figure out where the tenure is going and where the broader economy is going.\nNick Joseph: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Now turn to Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJim Kammert: Good morning. Thank you. Obviously, VICI is going to remain very much a gaming focused investing and operating company. But you mentioned that you vetted thoroughly some sort of other verticals didn't pan out, which is all logical. But could you quantify, do you think that your total addressable market or investment opportunity set for new potential verticals continue to expand? Just trying to figure out if your overall catch basin is sort of winnowing or widening? Thank you.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: It's definitely widening.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Definitely widening. As there are a few that we're saying, hey, we ultimately not right for us today, there's other opportunities that come about that we study, learn who the operators are, we learn where their locations are, we spend time with them. So, no question the funnel is getting wider.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. And I'll give you an example of that, Jim. When you really begin to know a category as David has spoken of, as you get to know that, if you will, the water experience category, which we first invested in through Great Wolf. What's really been remarkable over the last few years is the way in which really creative innovative operators are taking water experiences and continuing to innovate around them, not simply for kids losing their minds and spending their parents' money at Great Wolf, but also water experiences that are more focused on an adult crowd. And that's really exciting to witness because of the growth opportunities it represents within the category and across multiple geographies.\nJim Kammert: Okay. Thank you. And one small item, it's been in the press that there is some tax dispute underway at MGM National Harbor. It's obviously an important asset for VICI. But would that have any details around that and would it have any implications for you as landlord? Thank you.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes, that would be a tenant matter, so we wouldn't comment on that.\nJim Kammert: Okay. Thank you.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just looking at the photobook you sent out to everyone. More specifically looking at the Mirage in Las Vegas, is there anything that's going to go on in the next year on this asset and if so what would be the scope and time to build?\nJohn Payne: Yes, Wes, it's John. It's nice to talk to you and probably a question for our great partner in Hard Rock on timing, but I think they've as you've probably been following the story, they acquired the operations of the Mirage a little over a year ago from MGM and have been operating, but have also been out getting approvals and designing the opportunity to change the facility from the Mirage to the Hard Rock Las Vegas. As it pertains to timing and budget and construction and that it's probably something that they'll lead that charge. But we, of course, as the owner of the property are excited to watch that asset get repositioned over time. It's obviously an amazing asset for a long period of time, but I think everyone would think of Hard Rock Las Vegas would do great on that site.\nWes Golladay: Thanks for that. And then maybe just one on the financing front. You do have the $1 billion in churn this year. You have the $500 million of swaps. Are you looking at doing an unsecured to take those out, or you can maybe a mix of term loans and unsecured? How are you thinking about that?\nDavid Kieske: Wes, it's David. We will focus on continuing to access the unsecured market and extent our maturity tenure and increase the overall size of our investment grade basket those are legacy and MGP high yield note, so moving those to unsecured investment grade notes benefits our overall credit complex for the long run.\nWes Golladay: Thank you.\nOperator: Now turn to Daniel Guglielmo with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Guglielmo: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just thinking about the credit opportunities in experiential, you all have been on the journey for some time now. And thinking about the opportunities in the process for closing on the partnerships, what type of competition is in the other room these days? And high-level, how has that changed over the last few years?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: And, Dan, you're talking about, how is the competitive landscape of lending, evolved over the last few years?\nDaniel Guglielmo: Yes, like the fund. Yes.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. Well, obviously, we're looking at a period over the last couple of years in which conventional bank financing has definitely diminished as a source of funding for experiential placemakers and operators. And at the same time, obviously, you've seen the upsurge of private credit of which we are part. And I would say that in many cases, we are being invited in to the funding opportunity because of our track record in experiential and the endorsement that our underwriting process brings to a project that we choose to be involved in. We obviously look at them really rigorously and we again, I would say, we get invited in a lot to processes as opposed to having to scour the landscape, and throw our hats in the ring.\nDaniel Guglielmo: Great. Thank you. And then you all have such tremendous growth with some pretty big deals over the last few years. And thinking about kind of similar risk adjusted opportunities, are there areas that you see kind of, I would say, like big hitter opportunities or transactions out there, not just thinking next year, but maybe down, like, the line five years from now, that horizon.\nJohn Payne: Dan, nice to talk to you this morning. I'll just go back to our assets in Las Vegas and I don't know how you're describing big hitter. But, if there are opportunities for us to continue to invest in assets that we already own and help the operator grow with accretive new projects, I'll consider that being a big hitting because I'm not sure there's a better place in the world to invest in right now than Las Vegas. Obviously, we've got a portfolio there, but there are some amazing assets Ed referred to the Venetian that has a lot of footprint to continue to be developed. So --\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. And then I think John, we can add in obviously MGM, the MGM property in Yonkers should they be granted a full gaming license that will obviously that's property we already owned Daniel, that would obviously represent a significant incremental investment opportunity, but contingent, of course, on how the license award process plays out.\nDaniel Guglielmo: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Jake Kornreich with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJake Kornreich: Hey, thanks so much. Good morning. As you look to expand the non-gaming segment, should we continue to expect loans on the relatively smaller side for you as a way to step into longer term relationships? Or would you be willing to take kind of a larger bite into either the real estate or debt and a new asset type in a much bigger way, say, over $1 billion?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Oh, boy. That would be a pretty big number, Jay. The check sizes you're referring to, they may look small in relation to our overall scale. But I would tell you in returns, they're pretty big checks. These are not small assets and they're certainly not small and economic productivity. And so, if we can do $50 million to $100 million and up loans on assets that we either have a direct path to ownership on or a potential path to ownership on, you add those up and you can get to $1 billion in aggregate. But obviously, by not having it all in one single investment, we are obviously spreading out our risk and amplifying our opportunities to develop new relationships.\nJake Kornreich: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up on, I guess, the leverage. You're now at 5.5 times, which is in your, 5.5 times range. So, should we expect new transactions to be funded, I guess, with incrementally more debt capital at this point? Or do you intend to continue to over equitize new deals and get that leverage further down?\nDavid Kieske: Jake, it's David. We will continue to migrate our leverage down. We're obviously within our target range. And just to recap everybody post MGP, we take the leverage up to 5.8 times and worked very hard to get that back down to 5.5 times at the end of last year. So, that'll continue to drift downward both from over equitization of transactions and then depending on the size leverage neutral transactions.\nJake Kornreich: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn DeCree: Good morning, everyone. I've been looking up for almost an hour here and I think only one mention of F1. So, Ed, to kind of go back to your sports triangle, in Las Vegas, and you guys have some land, near the [F1 Paddock] (ph). And, you talk about this every once in a while, but curious your thoughts on professional sports, stadiums, that type of investment, and maybe specifically in the context of Las Vegas given, all the development around professional sports that we're seeing there and your land and partners?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Yes. I would say, John, it's professional sports. It's obviously the emergence of this sphere. It's the overall growth of Las Vegas. And we obviously have the vacant land, but probably even more valuable is the land we already own. You referred to the triangle formed by A Stadium, T-Mobile and Allegiant. We own everything inside that triangle. MGM operates everything inside that triangle. If you think about where the A Stadium is going to go, we own three of those four corners in MGM Grand, Excalibur and New York, New York. I know MGM is very excited about the repositioning opportunities at Dallas Four Corners and it applies to so many of the other assets that we own up and down the strip, as well as you say that vacant land. I just can't again emphasize enough how incredibly valuable it is to have the position we have in Las Vegas, because Las Vegas is reaching a global critical mass that really no other place on earth right now rivals, not Orlando, not Macau, the way things have evolved there. Las Vegas is a category of one and we are very happy to be the leading owner of real estate in a place that is a global category of one.\nJohn DeCree: Very good. Thanks. And maybe just one, since a lot of people are asking me, is the photo book going to be available in hard copy?\nEdward B. Pitoniak: We actually have printed a few, and if anybody really, really wants one, they should give me a call at their earliest convenience.\nJohn DeCree: [Indiscernible]\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Thanks, John. Elliot, I think we're probably about wrapped up, right?\nOperator: Yes. This concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to Edward Pitoniak, CEO for final remarks.\nEdward B. Pitoniak: Thank you, Elliot, and thanks everyone for your time today. And please, please do go to www.viciproperties.com under our Portfolio heading to view our brand new VICI Properties photo book. It's a magnificent book about your magnificent properties. Bye for now.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call is now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Edward B. Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. I'll start this morning with a few words about 2023 VICI accomplishments and the way forward. John Payne, will share our 2024 growth approach, and David Kieske will discuss our 2023 financial results and our 2024 guidance. Last night, we announced final 2023 AFFO per share of $2.15 representing year-over-year per share growth of 11.8%. VICI's 2023 AFFO growth will likely make VICI one of the 2023 income growth leaders among the 29 S&P 500 REITs that report AFFO per share. There are 30 S&P 500 REITs overall, representing approximately 90% of the U.S. REIT equity market capitalization at year-end. VICI's 2023 growth is largely the result of work we did in 2022, forging new relationships and new investments in both gaming and non-gaming both property acquisitions and property credit investments. I'm proud of our 2023 AFFO per share growth, but I'm also proud of what the VICI team did in 2023 to continue to produce growth for 2024 and beyond. Our investment activities in 2023 produce growth in our portfolio quality, geographic diversity, tenant diversity, and income. Indeed, when it comes to 2024 income growth, as David will discuss in a moment regarding our 2024 guidance, we expect our projected 2024 AFFO per share growth should put VICI well into the top half of the S&P 500 REIT 2024 AFFO per share growth table. It wasn't easy to produce future growth in 2023. It was tough to navigate in 2023. Most days in 2023 and frankly most days in 2024 so far remind me of my days living and working in Whistler, British Columbia, where our very challenging coastal mountain environment could result in days so foggy and whited out that we describe such days as skiing inside a milk bottle. But even amidst this low visibility, the VICI team kept pioneering in 2023. We invested in new geographies, including three new countries, and through our Bowlero acquisition in U.S. non-commercial gaming states such as Texas, California, and North Carolina. We invested in new categories such as family recreation and youth sports. We expanded our partnerships with pilgrimage brands like Cabot and Canyon Ranch. We acquired the primary leasehold interest in New York's incomparable Chelsea Piers. Through our position as the leading owner of real estate on the Las Vegas Strip, we continue to work with our Las Vegas partners to capitalize on Las Vegas' leadership position in global entertainment and hospitality. I strongly believe VICI's investment in Las Vegas is one of the most compelling investments in the current global commercial real estate investing landscape. As we set out in our earnings release last night, in 2023, we announced and closed $1.8 billion of capital acquisitions and investments within the year. Note that these figures do not include the $2.8 billion closing of our Mandalay Bay MGM Grand joint venture in early January 2023, which we announced in early December 2022, including our assumption of the remaining $1.5 billion of CMBS debt. A fundamental importance, our 2023 investing in gaming and non-gaming was accretive. Our announced 2023 capital investments were made at a blended initial unlevered investment yield of 7.7%. Our 2023 investing was also balance sheet enhancing. We funded this $1.8 billion of investment with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and equity and only about $200 million of incremental debt, achieving an equity-to-debt funding ratio on that investment activity of 8:1, demonstrating our commitment to our long range net leverage target of 5.0 times to 5.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As we look ahead within 2024, despite the continued cloudy macroeconomic conditions and outlook, we begin 2024 with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and forward equity resources to deploy into continuing accretive growth. Needless to say, in a macro environment of constrained capital conditions, we believe our capital resources can and will be attractive to gaming and experiential operators who want to grow and/or need liquidity. Finally, in 2024, we will continue to build a portfolio of quality. You've heard me say before that I believe VICI is the pioneer in bringing Class A real estate to net lease. By Class A, we mean real estate of great scale, great quality and high mission criticality. And VICI enables investors to own Class A real estate within the strong economic transparency and integrity of the net lease model. What we can, must, and will do is continue to enable existing and potential VICI investors to understand fully the scale, quality and mission criticality of our Class A real estate. To that end, we are proud to announce that we're launching today the VICI Properties photo book, a digital coffee table style book that brings to life the magnificence of the real estate owned by VICI. You can view this book online at our website, www.viciproperties.com. And I thank Hayes Honea of our team for her great work in producing and publishing this book. I strongly encourage you to give this book a good viewing. If you're a VICI shareholder, I believe the book will give you great pride in what you own. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to, John. I'll start, Tony, and good morning. Good to speak with you and then John and David can kick in. I would say that in the spirit of our opening remarks, we're obviously sober as you've heard from other REITs in recent weeks like [agri] (ph) and realty income. We're sober about the marketplace. We're sober about the capital markets and we're pretty sober about what kind of activity may be available to us. And yet having said that, John and the team continue to work the trap lines in such a way that we have a number of conversations going on both in gaming and non-gaming that have us very excited and John can talk about that in a moment. The other point I want to emphasize, Tony, is that the magnitude of what we own brings with it opportunities you wouldn't necessarily find in other REITs given the nature of the property they own, especially when we look at Las Vegas, where we've got, I think John, 40,000 odd hotel rooms. If you look just at an asset like The Venetian, which including parking is 17 million square feet, given what's going on there, given the impact of this sphere, the opportunity of Patrick and Nicole and the team to continue to asset manage, maximize the productivity of that asset is so, so strong. I mean, it's a magnitude of building. And again, this goes back to my opening remarks that we are going to continue to help the investment marketplace understand the magnitude of building such that there are 300,000 square feet inside the 17 million square feet that have never gone past the concrete stage, concrete floors, concrete walls, concrete ceilings 300,000 unfinished square feet. And with the job that the team at the Venetian is doing to maximize that asset, especially taking advantage of this sphere, that represents incremental investment opportunity or growth opportunity for us that you wouldn't likely find in most other REITs generally and certainly not in triple-net lease REITs generally which tend to have assets of 10,000 square feet not 17 million square feet. But John, you want to add to this? Okay. Another way of putting it, Tony, is we're not assuming any credit or horsepower from the funding and we're taking actually a marginal penalty by virtue of having it on our well, we technically, we don't have it on our balance sheet, but given the treasury stock method. Well, clearly, Barry, we want to be as opportunistic as we can be within our timing given the inherent nature of a call option. And obviously, that timing will be predicated on what our cost of funding is. And I don't think it would come as any surprise to anybody that we certainly would not choose to exercise our call option if in doing so we were creating dilution, which we don't ever want to do. And so, going back to the theme of, skiing inside a milk bottle, the visibility through 2024 given its current state is such that it's hard to predict with any kind of exactitude exactly when the right time would be. Yes. I'll start and I'll turn it over to John. Barry, I read the notes from that recent session you had, which were really interesting to read. I know one of the participants in your session sounded rather, I won't say bullish, but seemed to say that there may be means to do it. I will tell you with complete candor, we haven't exactly figured out how that would work yet, John, right? And Caitlin, let me just add on to that a little bit. Obviously, there have been questions understandably as to VICI, why don't you just do gaming and only gaming? And as we have emphasized in many, many occasions, we are still for all of the time remaining going to be intensely focused on gaming given what a great business within Wichita real estate. But one of the real benefits of investing in other experiential categories is well, first of all, comes with the fact that it's just fundamentally great real estate occupied by operators who offer very rich and profitable experiences to their end customers. So, that's the fundamental reason to invest in other experiential. It's fundamentally good real estate. The second dimension to that is that, it gives us a chance to grow when growth may not be available for gaming. And related to that, and this goes back to your initial question, Caitlin, one of the advantages we see in experiential operators like a Cabot, like a Canyon Ranch, like a Bowlero, like a Great Wolf, is they have network growth opportunities that are not as readily available to our gaming operators. The nature of growth in new stores and gaming is such that it is always subject to very strict regulatory control. For Cabot, as an example, on the other hand, they have a global growth opportunity that can be seized with great energy and does not suffer the restrictions, or the slowing down of cadence that tends to apply to gaming operators attempting to grow their network other than through M&A. And then to go back to the first part of your question, it will always be a minor percentage of our assets under management and we will use it to forge relationships. We have an example obviously right in front of us of using lending to establish a relationship with Chelsea Piers that led to the acquisition of the primary leasehold interest in December. So, we will use it both as a strategic tool to develop relationships and a strategic tool to create a steadier cadence to our capital allocation. We're very proud of the fact that we got capital out the door every single month in 2023. And I can tell you in our early years, there were whole quarters that went by where we did not get capital out the door, given what was true back then, which was that the nature of our capital allocation was big and lumpy, tied to big lumpy gaming acquisitions. So, it is a tool that can generate growth and return on a very steady basis. It is a strategic tool to forge relationships. And again, given some of the spreads we've been able to achieve in recent years, it is very lucrative, very accretive in driving earnings growth. And again, we're about creating earnings growth that others may not be able to achieve if they're not as energetic and pioneering as we have been both in terms of how we grow the business in terms of asset classes and through the use of our balance sheet. Yes. Well, as I said in response to Barry, obviously, 7.7 is not as attractive as when it was struck a few years back when the call agreement was struck a few years back. And it will be a call opportunity. We will be excited about executing if it's an accretive opportunity and if it's not an accretive opportunity. If in fact there would be a dilutive opportunity at 7.7, we would not do it. Well, yes, Chris. So, the rent coverage, by virtue of the current call agreement is set, but, it is a subject to discussion, and one we have and would like to continue to explore with Caesars, such that on an overall basis, they and we are at rent coverages that everybody feels really good about for decades to come. Yes. So, you are right, Greg. If we're partnering with an experiential operator that's not public, the tenant financials are not crystal clear in the same way they're not crystal clear across a whole lot of net lease portfolios. And at the end of the day, we obviously have to exercise our fiduciary responsibility to the greatest degree possible in ensuring that the fundamental business is very, very supportive of the rent and the way in which our operating partners manage their balance sheets and liquidity is also of a strength that ensures that they won't be in positions where they're unable to meet the rent. We've got a very rigorous underwriting practice. We obviously can take advantage of history in many of the categories, experiential categories that we're investing in. And again, at the end of the day, it's up to us to make sure that they are of a strength, that's going to enable them to weather whatever should come their way. But I will also emphasize that our key criteria, our first of four criteria in evaluating all investments, gaming and experiential widely, is that the businesses be of lower than average cyclicality versus consumer discretionary at large, which we think is another risk mitigant when it comes to ensuring that they can cover the rent through thick and thin. Well, last dollar exposure is obviously one of the key criteria and ensuring that our last dollar exposure is at a level whereby if we did end up owning the asset that the operating economics are such that at the last dollar exposure level that we would be lending at, we're still in good shape. No, it's a very fair strategic question, Greg, and it's a question we regularly wrestle with. I would say one of the ways in which we deal with, if you will, the underinvestment risk in G&A is by, I think, having forged some of the strongest partnership relationships of anybody out there. From day one, we have treated our advisors as best as we possibly can. This means the investment banks, the other parties, the real estate advisory firms, such that we are always the first they call when they think there's a compelling opportunity. They are a force multiplier for us. And we have great respect for them. We engage with them intensely. We reward them when they do great work for us. And in the event, we end up saving on G&A, which in an inflationary period has really two benefits, overall low G&A to begin with and less inflationary impact on our G&A load. If it ever gets to the point where we feel we're short changing shareholders by running too thin, we will certainly add resources in the way we've obviously added resources here in the last couple of years. Thank you, Greg, we'll move on to the next question. Yes. And Nick, you've given me the opportunity to vent a little bit about how utterly weary I am around the negativity of so much of the media coverage, which regularly gets proven to be way overly negative. Oh my God, this sphere is going to be a disaster. I was in the U.K. earlier this week. I was struck by how many people wanted to talk about this sphere because they'd either already been or they're determined to go. And again, media coverage around that, oh my god. Oh, F1 is going to be a disaster. Well, guess what? It wasn't. The drivers loved it. The teams loved it. It was an amazing weekend of business for our operating partners. So Super Bowl, again, just a phenomenal event for Las Vegas and for the NFL. So, I absolutely agree with you. Some of the press coverage has been quite negative, but we know the people involved, we know how hard they're working, we know how challenging what it is that they've set forth for themselves to open an unaffiliated property on the strip. And yet again, that asset is utterly magnificent and they're doing the right things to bring business to it over time. And with the backing of Coke, you can be sure that the backing is strong enough that they have the patience, but moreover the firepower to make this work in due course. Nick, are you talking about cap rate variability across various experiential asset classes? Yes. I don't know, John and David, I don't know that we've seen a tremendous amount of variability across asset classes. We're obviously not seeing a tremendous amount of trading. And yet you obviously saw with our unlevered 7.7% yield for the $1.8 billion we put out the door in 2023, that we have obviously been able to acquire income at higher yields. I would have a tough time generalizing, but David and John, I don't know if you want to add. It's definitely widening. Yes. And I'll give you an example of that, Jim. When you really begin to know a category as David has spoken of, as you get to know that, if you will, the water experience category, which we first invested in through Great Wolf. What's really been remarkable over the last few years is the way in which really creative innovative operators are taking water experiences and continuing to innovate around them, not simply for kids losing their minds and spending their parents' money at Great Wolf, but also water experiences that are more focused on an adult crowd. And that's really exciting to witness because of the growth opportunities it represents within the category and across multiple geographies. Yes, that would be a tenant matter, so we wouldn't comment on that. Thank you, Jim. And, Dan, you're talking about, how is the competitive landscape of lending, evolved over the last few years? Yes. Well, obviously, we're looking at a period over the last couple of years in which conventional bank financing has definitely diminished as a source of funding for experiential placemakers and operators. And at the same time, obviously, you've seen the upsurge of private credit of which we are part. And I would say that in many cases, we are being invited in to the funding opportunity because of our track record in experiential and the endorsement that our underwriting process brings to a project that we choose to be involved in. We obviously look at them really rigorously and we again, I would say, we get invited in a lot to processes as opposed to having to scour the landscape, and throw our hats in the ring. Yes. And then I think John, we can add in obviously MGM, the MGM property in Yonkers should they be granted a full gaming license that will obviously that's property we already owned Daniel, that would obviously represent a significant incremental investment opportunity, but contingent, of course, on how the license award process plays out. Oh, boy. That would be a pretty big number, Jay. The check sizes you're referring to, they may look small in relation to our overall scale. But I would tell you in returns, they're pretty big checks. These are not small assets and they're certainly not small and economic productivity. And so, if we can do $50 million to $100 million and up loans on assets that we either have a direct path to ownership on or a potential path to ownership on, you add those up and you can get to $1 billion in aggregate. But obviously, by not having it all in one single investment, we are obviously spreading out our risk and amplifying our opportunities to develop new relationships. Yes. I would say, John, it's professional sports. It's obviously the emergence of this sphere. It's the overall growth of Las Vegas. And we obviously have the vacant land, but probably even more valuable is the land we already own. You referred to the triangle formed by A Stadium, T-Mobile and Allegiant. We own everything inside that triangle. MGM operates everything inside that triangle. If you think about where the A Stadium is going to go, we own three of those four corners in MGM Grand, Excalibur and New York, New York. I know MGM is very excited about the repositioning opportunities at Dallas Four Corners and it applies to so many of the other assets that we own up and down the strip, as well as you say that vacant land. I just can't again emphasize enough how incredibly valuable it is to have the position we have in Las Vegas, because Las Vegas is reaching a global critical mass that really no other place on earth right now rivals, not Orlando, not Macau, the way things have evolved there. Las Vegas is a category of one and we are very happy to be the leading owner of real estate in a place that is a global category of one. We actually have printed a few, and if anybody really, really wants one, they should give me a call at their earliest convenience. Thanks, John. Elliot, I think we're probably about wrapped up, right? Thank you, Elliot, and thanks everyone for your time today. And please, please do go to www.viciproperties.com under our Portfolio heading to view our brand new VICI Properties photo book. It's a magnificent book about your magnificent properties. Bye for now."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. In 2023, VICI was able to navigate a volatile broader market backdrop, particularly for REITs and consistently deployed capital in accretive manners throughout the year. Over the course of 2023, we deployed $1.8 billion at a blended yield of approximately 7.7% across investments that expanded our geographic reach domestically and internationally, broadened our investable universe across gaming, hospitality and family entertainment, and deepened our ability to invest creatively through property related credit investments. Our ability to transact successfully last year was due in part to the multi-year effort I've mentioned before on our earnings calls. Every day at VICI, our team shows up for work and focuses on developing and maintaining relationships with best-in-class growth oriented operators, while some REITs describes themselves simply as a landlord and position themselves to extract value from their tenants. We view ourselves as a long-term capital partner collaborating with our tenants to create value. This philosophy of serving as a capital partner and prioritizing relationships with operators who pursue growth energetically serves as our compass as we assess and underwrite opportunities in the current environment, an environment that is characterized by low visibility and fluctuating cost of capital. To that end, many of you have heard me speak over the years about our focus on growth and it's also important to understand that there have been numerous situations in which we elect to not pursue opportunities. VICI is in the very fortunate position to have created significant shareholder value over the years. For example, we've grown our AFFO per share at 8.5% CAGR from 2018 through 2023, while our dividend has grown at a comparable high-single-digit rate and we do not believe we need to pursue growth surely for the sake of growing. For those of you who may be newer to our story, I would like to touch on a few elements of our growth pillars that have allowed us to successfully complete $36 billion of accretive transaction volume in a little over six years. Number 1, we work collaboratively with operating partners investing in growth opportunities and funding high ROI capital projects in order to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Number 2, as the only S&P 500 REIT predominantly invested in the gaming industry, given 90% of our rent roll is derived from gaming investments, our team travels far and wide, visiting properties, studying new markets, assessing the landscape and meeting with operators across regional, Las Vegas and even international locations. Number 3, we are supplementing our gaming investments with opportunities in experiential sectors that we believe are positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds. We focus on sourcing transaction with operators who are positioning themselves for growth, including through roll-up in an industry much as you saw with our Cabot and Bowlero transactions announced in October of last year. And finally, number 4, we constantly keep our eyes open for opportunities where VICI can get better by getting bigger as demonstrated through the acquisition of MGM Growth Properties in 2022, which significantly expanded our footprint in Las Vegas, added Class A market leading regional assets to our portfolio, improved our balance sheet to investment grade and has positioned us for a long-term partnership with MGM Resorts, a world class gaming, hospitality, and leisure operator. As we dive further into 2024, we hold firm to the criteria that has driven much of our track record to-date while executing across our strategic pillars. In particular, we are adhering to prudent underwriting standards, ensuring your capital is appropriately compensated as we assess risk and pursue opportunities across different properties, markets and asset classes. And as I said earlier, we maintain a preference for growth focused operators with our entire team evaluating a partner's track record and importantly, their use of proceeds, which typically explains intentions behind pursuing a transaction. We ultimately believe the right partnerships lead to the right opportunities, which feeds the flywheel of value creation through collaboration. We believe our commitment to developing and deepening relationship with great operators of all shapes and sizes combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will afford us the ability to continue executing accretive deals during a time when other REITs may be stuck \u201cskiing inside a milk bottle.\u201d Now, I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David? Tony, you can hear from Ed's comments. He spent some time in Las Vegas recently, which I have as well. You asked a question about what sectors and I also think what locations. We obviously have been spending a lot of time in Las Vegas. We're very proud of our partners' success there and it looks like 2024 is going to be a great year as well. And as you heard from my remarks, we continue to look at different target sectors whether in wellness and indoor waterparks, pilgrimage golf, family entertainment center. We made our first investment in youth sports, which we like the mixed use of youth sports. So, I continue to spend my time with my team and really the whole company looking at a variety of these and checking the boxes of which ones could make for long-term investments. And there are some sectors that we don't talk about that we've kind of checked off the list that says this is not right for our capital at this time. But we shouldn't confuse that the casino business continues to be real focus of our company and one that we are just can't be more proud of the operators and what they've done in \u201823 and what we see in \u201824. But Barry, you touched on, we've been really excited to build relationships with three tribes in the commercial sector and it's something that we can continue to talk with them and other tribal partners that we've gotten to know to see could there be an opportunity to help them grow on their nation's land. But we have primarily been focused with our partners on the commercial sector and we'll continue to study that opportunity because as Ed said, we saw the study of the report that came out as well. Yes. Good morning, Caitlin. Very good question you asked. No question that we continue to meet with our 13 partners currently in gaming and non-gaming and talk about how our capital can help them grow over the coming years. And as Ed alluded to, the boxes that are in I shouldn't even call them boxes in Las Vegas, the amazing resorts we own with partners in Las Vegas could provide with a lot of opportunity in the relatively near future and in the coming years as those partners look to grow whether that's in hotel rooms, new restaurants, new attractions. Ed mentioned obviously the sphere where that sits on our land. We weren't involved in the building or they're not our direct tenant. But we see that as a pillar of growth for our company over the coming years, not only in Las Vegas, but in our regional assets because there are large regional assets whether that's the MGM assets in National Harbor or in Detroit, there are opportunities to grow as well. And then I think your second part of the question is, are we looking to continue to expand our tenant roster? And the answer is, absolutely. Me, my team, Ed, David, Sam, anyone else in the company is out, forging new relationships to see if there's new sectors or new companies that we can use our capital to help them grow. So, I wouldn't be surprised if you see some new operators or new tenants in our roster over the coming year. Yes, Chris, it's John. As when we made the announcement a few months ago, we talked about spending a couple of years studying the youth sports business and we learned a lot in that process. We've also found an amazing partner in Homefield. We announced our first opportunity with them in the Kansas City area and they're building not only the youth sports facility but connected to a Margaritaville Resorts. That's one of the things, I think you'll continue to see is if we place other investments into the youth sports spaces, having numerous cash registers, not just having the fields to rent or the stadiums to rent, but also having connected to one operator who controls the restaurants, who controls the hotel rooms and controls the sports fields. So, this is a $110 millionish initial investment with Homefield. We've not announced any further development not only on that site, which does have opportunity to expand over time, but also other sites around the Midwest or the United States. But as with any partner that we've talked about whether that's with casino partners or with Cabot or Canyon Ranch and now Homefield, we hope that it's not just our only investment with them and we purposely took so much time to study the business to find the right partner to grow. Yes, Greg, and then it comes down, as I mentioned, quality of the sponsors, the amount of equities, the overall loan-to-cost or loan-to-value and then the protections that are obviously ultimately documented in our agreements. But a lot of the sectors and we like our sale leaseback investments, we study the sectors. Indoor water parts, we studied for 18 odd months led by certain members of our team and went deep into that sector before we did anything. And so it's getting gaining conviction whether it be through direct real estate ownership or the lending platform that we have of who the operator is, the durability of the sector and then the ultimate protections that we can put in place. Nick, I won't necessarily talk about the financial performance, but what I will make a comment about is, what a beautiful asset, that was built by the team there, the Coke Industries, the Fontainebleau team, the operating team there that I haven't met anyone that walks through the place and says, oh, this is a, I mean I think most people walk through the place and say, wow, what an amazing place. And I think for those of us who have spent time operating in Las Vegas over the years, it takes time. It takes time to build up a database and it takes time, but they sure do have a facility that I think everyone is proud of and we sure are proud of. Yes. Definitely widening. As there are a few that we're saying, hey, we ultimately not right for us today, there's other opportunities that come about that we study, learn who the operators are, we learn where their locations are, we spend time with them. So, no question the funnel is getting wider. Yes, Wes, it's John. It's nice to talk to you and probably a question for our great partner in Hard Rock on timing, but I think they've as you've probably been following the story, they acquired the operations of the Mirage a little over a year ago from MGM and have been operating, but have also been out getting approvals and designing the opportunity to change the facility from the Mirage to the Hard Rock Las Vegas. As it pertains to timing and budget and construction and that it's probably something that they'll lead that charge. But we, of course, as the owner of the property are excited to watch that asset get repositioned over time. It's obviously an amazing asset for a long period of time, but I think everyone would think of Hard Rock Las Vegas would do great on that site. Dan, nice to talk to you this morning. I'll just go back to our assets in Las Vegas and I don't know how you're describing big hitter. But, if there are opportunities for us to continue to invest in assets that we already own and help the operator grow with accretive new projects, I'll consider that being a big hitting because I'm not sure there's a better place in the world to invest in right now than Las Vegas. Obviously, we've got a portfolio there, but there are some amazing assets Ed referred to the Venetian that has a lot of footprint to continue to be developed. So --"

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thank you, John. It's great to speak with everyone today and we appreciate your time. I want to start with our balance sheet. 2023 exemplifies the continued discipline we have maintained over our six plus years of existence by ensuring that we allocate capital accretively, have a balance sheet and liquidity profile designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. During the year, we raised over $1.6 billion in forward equity. In January of 2023, we raised approximately a $1 billion in gross forward equity proceeds at a $33 price per share. Those proceeds were used throughout the year to accretively fund our transactions. We utilized our ATM program throughout 2023 raising $643 million in gross forward proceeds. That amount includes $390 million which was raised in Q4 through the sale of 13.2 million shares via the forward and remains outstanding today. And subsequent to year-end in Q1 2024, we sold 9.7 million shares raising $306 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward. This brings our total outstanding forward equity to just under $700 million bolstering our overall liquidity. Currently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $523 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, $696 million of proceeds under our outstanding forwards and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we begin 2024, we believe we're extremely well-positioned to navigate the current environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital as we sit here today. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA annualized for a full-year of activity from our recent acquisitions and excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity is approximately 5.5 times within our target leverage range. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35% taking into account our hedge portfolio that we utilized in connection with our April 2022 inaugural investment grade offering in a weighted average 5.9 years to maturity. As of December 31, we've entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swap agreements ahead of our May 1, $1.05 billion bond maturity, which has an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. This portfolio has an effective treasury rate of 4.04%. Just touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 8.8% compared to $0.51 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. For the full-year 2023, AFFO per share was $2.15 an increase of 11.8% compared to $1.93 for the full-year 2022, and as Ed mentioned, making VICI one of the leaders across the S&P 500 REITs. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $15.3 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%. This continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple-net sector but across all REITs. Turning to our guidance. And as you saw in our release last night, we are initiating AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to be between $2.32 billion $2.355 billion or between $2.22 per share $2.25 per share. Based on the midpoint of our 2024 guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4%, very attractive starting point as we begin 2024. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced, but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other non-recurring transaction or items. And as we've mentioned previously, we record a non-cash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Tony, there's no implied use of proceeds or drawdown. There's a little bit of impact from treasury stock dilution in the ultimate share count, but that's the only impact. Yes. Caitlin, it's David. Great to hear from you. Thanks for joining today. Look, the nature of our capital is relationship capital and it's where we've been active both as you just mentioned on the loan side as well as the sale leaseback side. And it's as, John talked about in his comments, solving our partners objectives and being a source of growth capital. And sometimes that growth capital comes in the door day one, like you saw with our Homefield opportunity where they're building a facility and going to construct a very, very, very attractive experiential both sports and hotel asset, which will lead to a sale leaseback. So, it's we're always out talking about ways that we can help our partners grow and to kind of put it in a percentage basket of X amount of loans and X amount of sale leasebacks. That's just how we look at it or how we kind of parse our pipeline. It's about finding the great partners that we've talked about on this call. Hey Ravi, it's David. Good to hear from you. I didn't, clear caught your question. It's how we think about kind of the spread on those mezz loan, especially around development. Look, we always there's a couple of ways that we look at it and it's a little bit more art than science at the end of the day. But what's the cost of the seniors? Is there a senior lender ahead of us? Are we achieving the right risk adjusted spread to the senior? Obviously, what's the duration of our capital? What's the funding cadence of our capital? And then ultimately, what most every lender looks at, what's the equity sponsor and how much equity is in the transaction and ensuring that we are protected from a credit standpoint at the end of the day and feel good about the project. Yes. I think you covered it well, but Nick, I mean, it's no different than any other asset class that you're in kind of the broader net lease. You have bid ask spreads and buyers obviously willing sorry, sellers' willingness to transact around in a backdrop where there's the volatility and variability that we've talked about. And so, there's opportunity out there, but it's a no difference in the broader CRE market. It's somewhat of a bit of a quieter environment and just an air of caution cautious on both sides until we kind of figure out where the tenure is going and where the broader economy is going. Wes, it's David. We will focus on continuing to access the unsecured market and extent our maturity tenure and increase the overall size of our investment grade basket those are legacy and MGP high yield note, so moving those to unsecured investment grade notes benefits our overall credit complex for the long run. Jake, it's David. We will continue to migrate our leverage down. We're obviously within our target range. And just to recap everybody post MGP, we take the leverage up to 5.8 times and worked very hard to get that back down to 5.5 times at the end of last year. So, that'll continue to drift downward both from over equitization of transactions and then depending on the size leverage neutral transactions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, October 26, 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today is Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Louie McCluskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2023 is a quarter most REITs are happy to be done with. The REIT Index in Q3 2023 was down 8%, swinging negative for the year after not a great year last year, and October has only continued a negative trend. But while the REIT stock marketplace didn't have a great quarter in Q3 2023, the key question to ask is what a given REIT did in Q3 and now in October to improve its business for the future. At VICI, our answer to this question has a number of elements to it. We played offense selectively. We played defense. We capitalized on certain current conditions. We prepared for potential future conditions. We increased our dividend effective with Q3 2023 and an annualized rate that well exceeds forward inflation expectations and continued rate of dividend growth since 2019 and that is 3x greater than the largest net lease REIT over the same period. And if there has ever been a period in which one should value a solidly covered and solidly growing dividend, that currently exceeds the 10-year rate. This is it. Finally, in a year in which REIT earnings growth has generally been difficult to come by, VICI's AFFO per share earnings in Q3 grew 10.7% year-over-year. VICI announced within and subsequent to quarter-end, about $1.1 billion of new capital commitments. While most of you have seen the strategic and economic merits of these investments, we know there are some of you who feel that we should have left that capital in a stockpile. Some of you feel understandably that volatility is too high and visibility is too low. We agree volatility is high and visibility is low. And with the market movements of especially the last few weeks, we are sober and cautious about what the market conditions for capital allocation could be from here for how long, no one knows. But I can tell you that we continue to have high conviction about the commitments we've recently made with Century, with Canyon Ranch and now with Valero. These commitments represented immediately accretive investments in real estate that should have positive impacts on 2024 earnings. These commitments also represent investments in relationships that can and will be the answer in future years to, okay, now that things are back to normal, how are you going to grow, VICI. Again, none of us know when the all-clear signal will sound, but it will in some way and REITs that continue to invest in relationships we'll be best positioned to resume growing when market conditions and values have stabilized. That's what we at VICI did in the recovery out of COVID. Our situational readiness put us in the position to acquire the Venetian and MGP, investments that are a key driver of our 2023 earnings growth, and we made these investments and many other would be made [technical difficulty] hadn\u2019t been fully readying themselves for recovery. We have been able to undertake our recent investments because of the astute and agile work of Moira McCloskey and the VICI Capital Markets team. Going back to our nearly $1 billion overnight equity raise in early January 2023, VICI has opportunistically raised a total of approximately $1.3 billion of forward equity in 2023, giving VICI a cost of funds for our recent investments to drive the immediate accretion of which we've spoken. We also made defense this past quarter. During Q3 and subsequent to quarter-end, we played defense by using close to $1 billion of equity in cash and only about $55 million of debt to fund our new capital commitments demonstrating our commitment to our long-range leverage targets. David Kieske and the VICI Finance team also played defense by adding a further $200 million of swap protection since Q2 in anticipation of our 2024 refinancing of $1.05 billion of the legacy MGP 5.625 notes giving us a total of $450 million of swap protection. And while we did all this, our tenants continue to demonstrate the vitality of their businesses, as John will speak of momentarily. I'm very proud of the work the entire VICI team did this quarter against a volatile and difficult backdrop, the VICI team working within one of the lightest G&A loads of any S&P 500 REIT continue to create a culture of excellence and resilience that I'm confident will serve VICI's stakeholders well for years to come no matter what those years bring. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Payne for an operating and transaction marketplace update, and John will then pass the mic to David Kieske, who will give our financial and guidance update. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. While 2023 has been a volatile year in the real estate sector, as Ed just highlighted, we at VICI have put ourselves in the position on both a capital and relationship basis to not only continue our business but to expand it into new sectors, new relationships and new geographies. In the third quarter, we continued to grow with our partners at Century Casinos by closing our Rocky Gap Casino Resort acquisition in Maryland, and our sale leaseback of four gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, growing our international footprint. Subsequent to quarter-end, we were very excited to announce our entry into the family entertainment sector, through our acquisition of 38 bowling entertainment centers with our new partners at Valero, led by Tom Shannon and Brett Parker, the Valero team is a perfect example of a talented growth-minded operator that has a deep understanding of their consumer recreational trends and the value that a VICI relationship and our capital can bring to their growth strategies. VICI's tenants are not only continuing to show strong operating results, but are also continuing to invest in capital improvements all over the United States. Caesars is investing over $400 million into just one asset, Harrah's New Orleans. The Venetian just announced a $1 billion plan to further enhance our asset, including almost $200 million in just convention center space. MGM spends hundreds of millions of dollars in CapEx each year on assets throughout Las Vegas and the regional markets. And even our smallest operators are investing millions of dollars each year on growth projects, thereby enhancing the quality of our assets and the productivity of their operating businesses. These reinvestment commitments add to our conviction that we are continuing to construct a high-quality portfolio of assets with the best experiential operators for our investors. This high-quality classification comes from not only the quality of the real estate itself, but also from the outsized productivity of these assets, productivity that is hard to come by in almost any other real estate sector. No place highlights the health and productivity of our tenants better than Las Vegas. After meeting with Caesar's CEO, Tom Reeg at G2E, which is the largest gaming conference in the United States, one analyst noted that Caesars is on pace for its best October ever. And this is against the backdrop of current macroeconomic uncertainty. Even during these tough times, Las Vegas continues to open new world-class attractions while diversifying its revenue stream and customer base. The opening of the must-see entertainment venue, the sphere world famous events like Formula 1 and the 2024 Super Bowl and a diverse and robust convention and conference schedule all helped showcase that there's no city performing like Las Vegas, that has clearly become the entertainment epicenter of the world. Outside of Las Vegas, regional performance has continued to be resilient, while many operators in our discussions have cited increased expenses related to items such as insurance or unrated play normalizing against tough comps, regional operations continue to run at very strong profit levels supported by loyal consumers with their respective database. Strategically, we continue to be focused on all fronts: gaming, nongaming, domestic and international to grow our pipeline for VICI's future. In gaming, Danny Valoy and I are in constant dialogue with new potential partners domestically and internationally, and we are just as excited by the ways we can potentially help our current tenants grow through additional tuck-in acquisitions or by utilizing our partner property growth fund in which we seek to fund our tenants high ROI opportunities at our existing assets. Meanwhile, Kellen Floral has been cultivating invaluable connections and relationships across the family entertainment, sport, wellness, leisure and recreation sectors as we continue pursuing our mission to be the real estate capital partner of choice to best-in-class growth minding operators of unique social infrastructure properties. During this most challenging time of market volatility for everyone, it is more important than ever for our team to continue to grow and deepen our networks and to grow our breadth of opportunities to best position for the years to come. This work is intended to position us to continue to deliver the growth our shareholders have come to expect from the VICI team. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today. The VICI team takes pride in what we've accomplished in 2023, acknowledging the year is not over, but the results we posted last night and last week's Bowlero announcement are exemplary of those accomplishments, as Ed said, we are improving the business, which should benefit VICI and you as shareholders as to 2024 and beyond. Highlighting the transaction we closed last week with Bowlero and we have spoken to many of you about, the deal was immediately accretive to our AFFO given we had prepared by raising forward equity for the transaction many months earlier generating an attractive spread to that cost of capital. From an economic standpoint, the deal is very attractive. But as John mentioned, it also builds a partnership with a market leader that we and the Bowlero team believe will grow together in the future. Subsequent to funding this transaction, we have approximately $3 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $430 million in cash, $250 million of estimated net proceeds available under our forward sale agreements and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In terms of net leverage, net debt to annualized Q3 adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35% accounting for our hedge portfolio and a weighted average of 6.1 years to maturity. Then as we prepare for our first bond refinancing in early 2024, we have entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $450 million to date. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of nearly 11% compared to $0.49 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $14.4 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend of $0.415 per share or $1.66 on an annualized basis, representing a 6.4% year-over-year increase. Then turning to guidance. We are updating and increasing AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis year ending December 31, 2023, is now expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.18 billion or between $2.14 and $2.15 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 11%, one of the highest expected growth rates across all REITs. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transaction items. And as a reminder, we do record a noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Elliott, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question today comes from Anthony Paolon with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnthony Paolone: All right. Thank you, and good morning. My first question is we all could see kind of how your capital costs have changed over the last few months. But maybe can you give us a sense as to how you see your operators, capital costs changing and whether or not sale-leaseback has become more or less competitive over the last few months.\nEdward Pitoniak: I'd say generally, Tony, it has become more competitive. I think as you look at, obviously, the stock trading values of the operators, but also the yield to worst on much of their credit or our capital has the potential to be very compelling in 2024, 2025, 2026. But that, of course, assumes that our cost of capital is in a place where we can generate positive spreads and accretion against that. And our confidence level in predicting or projecting our cost of capital a year from now is not high. If anyone does have my confidence in their projections, please call us immediately and let us know what we're missing.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. You'd mentioned your operators putting a lot of capital into the assets. And I know you have the property growth fund to help with that if they so choose to participate. But would you all reinvest post this if they decided they wanted to pull some of their capital out? Or do you see yourselves just limiting it to being involved in the projects as they're happening.\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Tony, just to level set here, Tony, the capital that I went through in my opening remarks is being put in by the tenant, not by VICI at this time, just to - and I think that's what you were asking. The other point of the question is if there's opportunities for us to help them with larger projects in this property growth fund would we do that? We would be thoughtful in our analytics behind an investment, and we talk to our partners all the time about how they're thinking about growing their businesses and is there an opportunity for us to deploy incremental capital for incremental rent. And we do that on an ongoing basis.\nEdward Pitoniak: Tony, if I understand your question correctly, I think you're asking us well, could there be opportunities downstream for us to buy incremental rent, if the operators' capital went into the creation of incremental real property. And yes, that could be an opportunity down the road should they want to monetize the value of the real property they created through their capital investments because it's all predicated, of course, on making sure we're buying good REIT income that is tied to the creation of incremental real property.\nAnthony Paolone: Got it. Yes, that's what I was asking. So I understood, John, that those items you were listing those capital costs were being funded by the operators already. And so yes, it was a question of if you would go in later if they decided, hey, look, we put this in, and we may want some of that back. Would you help us with that?\nEdward Pitoniak: Exactly right, Tony.\nAnthony Paolone: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. Your line is open.\nJohn DeCree: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. Ed or John, maybe we could talk a little bit about the Bowlero transaction and the cap rate that you've got to there. It's a little tighter than what we've seen in some of the last regional gaming cap rates show up that. I'm wondering if you could kind of speak to how you're looking at caps for family entertainment versus gaming and maybe more regional gaming than Vegas realizing Vegas is a bit of a different animal and other experiential real estate that you're looking at as well.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. I'll start, John, and then turn it over to John Payne. So when you look at our Bowlero transaction, it represents a number of different strategic initiatives. It obviously does, as you've already said, represent our initiation into a new category, into that new category, we significantly expand our TAM, and we do so by investing behind a highly superior business model that Tom Shannon and the Bowlero team have created and the growth opportunity they have to consolidate a very fragmented sector is very compelling to us. It is also a sector that obviously other REITs have invested in and could continue to invest in. So it is a somewhat more competitive marketplace with a consequent impact on cap rates than you might see in regional gaming. So it - there are times when gaming investments and nongaming investments can be a bit apple and orange-ish, if you will, given that they do represent different marketplaces with different characteristics. I do think the point of emphasis needs to be that the 7.3% cap rate was immediately accretive and a very positive spread to the cost of capital. David Moore and the team have raised over the course of 2023, and we're very excited about the growth opportunity going forward. John, do you have anything to add?\nJohn Payne: Yes, John, I just mentioned you asked about other categories that we're looking at. Obviously, we've already placed investments in indoor water parks, wellness with Canyon Ranch, Pilgrimage Golf, we made an investment in family entertainment center, as you said, with Bowlero. But we continue to spend some time looking for opportunities to develop long-term partnerships in wellness, leisure, recreation, some entertainment sectors and some sports sectors as well. And I think it's important. The final thing I'll just add is it's not an either or it's not a pay, you're looking at gaming, and that's what we're just focused on. And you're looking at wellness and that's what you've spoken on. We've got the capacity now to constantly look for these unique opportunities to place investments over time, as Ed mentioned in his opening remarks.\nJohn DeCree: That's helpful. I think that made a good point about the capital raised previously for this transaction. So I appreciate the additional color. Maybe for a follow-up, John, you've kind of alluded on sports and other categories of entertainment, I guess, in the context of the MSG Sphere opening in Las Vegas and has certainly rave reviews and kind of looks like the epitome of experiential entertainment to us. So curious if that changes your thinking about the category, stadium, entertainment, mixed-use and maybe the bigger kind of business model is models that more rely on ticket sales perhaps than anything else. I'm not sure if your thoughts or thinking in that category has changed at all?\nJohn Payne: It has not changed, but you hit on the sphere with what an amazing entertainment venue that was added to Las Vegas and sits on our land. It is truly - there's no entertainment venue like it, not only in the United States, but probably the world. But this is a category that we have looked at. We continue to study. We clearly have not made an investment, and we're trying to better understand the long-term economics and viability of certain projects. But boy, the sphere is amazing, John, if you get the opportunity, you should go to an event there.\nJohn DeCree: Yes, absolutely. Thanks John. Thanks everyone.\nJohn Payne: Thank you, John.\nOperator: We now turn to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the questions on Bowlero, but more from me how you're thinking about value creation and capital allocation and risk holistically in the current environment. In the past, you talked about seeking a minimum 100, 150 basis points spread as an investment hurdle. I guess I'm curious if that's still the case in today's environment, or would you perhaps want to seek more?\nDavid Kieske: Haendel, it's David. Good to talk to you. No, that is absolutely still the case in this environment. And as we talked about, obviously, we were fortunate to raise the capital this for the Bowlero transaction, specifically earlier in the year when, in fact, the Bowlero was in our pipeline back then things take weeks, months and time to come together. But we're not -- is not in the sand as we sit here today. If we look at the screen, see where the tenure is. We obviously see where our stock price is and still are on generating those types of 100 to 150 basis point spreads to our cost of capital. As we think about it, we think about the next dollar of cost of capital, where do we need to price something make it accretive based on the market that we are in and underwriting at that time and the capital that we have available to us.\nEdward Pitoniak: I'll just add, Haendel. We've had a few questions along the lines of, well, geez, could you have used that money to buy 9 and 10 cap assets? And our answer to that would be today and especially during the period in which you were gestating the Bowlero deal, we don't see any really good real estate occupied by really good operators trading at 9 and 10 caps right now. The day could come when they do, but that day is not here right now. And in the meantime, with this capital volatility that we see, we will be very, very careful in recognizing that not only is the cost of capital volatile on a day-by-day basis, that has implications for any deals that have long gestation periods. So we will have to particularly take care any kind of deal making that requires longer gestation periods to account for the fact we do not have capital cost certainty by any means, and won't necessarily have it until the day we decide to do a deal, which means we will take great care in deciding to do anything against these market conditions.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it understood. And one more something else that was unique about Bowlero. It marked the first direct equity ownership in nongaming real estate on your part. I guess I'm curious if that's something you can expect more of going forward? And I know that deal is still a relatively small piece of ABR, about 1%, but you do have a ROFO for eight years. So curious how do you see there with either that partner and/or within that space going forward. Thanks.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. So you're right. Technically, that -- these do represent our first direct investments, immediate ownership of nongaming real estate. What we should point out, of course, is that through our ventures with Cabot and Canyon Ranch, we have contracted for call rights that give us a direct path to real estate ownership in the future. So it happens to just be a difference between the nature of our acquisition of real estate potential acquisition of real estate with Cabot and Canyon's Ranch versus the immediate acquisition with Bowlero. And certainly, in this case, you had an operator with a very compelling opportunity to grow, a very compelling opportunity to put sale-leaseback capital to work, which led to our immediate acquisition of the real estate itself.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Hi. Just two quick ones for me. Just going back to sort of the Bowlero transaction, and I appreciate all the details that you provided there in the partnership and so forth. But as you're thinking about sort of the family entertainment sort of space, Bowling is sort of an interesting one. Maybe a little bit more color on how the deal came about and what other sort of avenues or verticals and family entertainment that you entertain?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Ron, and good to hear from you. I do think one of the key characteristics of bowling is that it is a low barrier to entry experience, but it is an experience that you can get better at. And that's in contrast to some other experiences that can take place within the family entertainment sector, where people might do it once or twice, and they go, okay, fun. I've done that. I don't need to do it again. And Boeing is at its very heart recreation. And if you want to get philosophical about it, you can say, it goes back to our most ancient human urges to aim at a target and strike a target. And people tend to get pretty excited when they strike targets. And that energy exists within bowling. It's a recreational energy and not a passive energy. So we think that, that has resiliency aspects to it that are at the heart of why bowling has endured in various warrants for literally hundreds and hundreds of years, whether outdoor on lands or indoors and buildings. But I'll now turn it over to John, who can give you more color on how we develop that relationship. John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, Ron, I was just going to add that you've heard me speak about times that relationships take time. And this is one that I think I looked at my notes in my first meeting was years ago with one of the top executives at Bowlero. And we just studied the business for this long. It's got scale. It's got healthy credit -- it's a business that has great margin with growth potential. The one other thing I'll add to Ed's remarks, as we continue to study the Bowlero business was the diversification of its revenue streams. It has many cash registers how the business can get into the consumer's wallet. It gets revenues from food and beverage. It gets a large percentage from bowling, it gets business revenues from amusement. So we like that diversification as we dug into the business and dug into the team. So we really took time years in this case to understand the business. And then I think your final part was are there other operators over time that we could buy real estate and be partners with. And we're going to continue to study the family entertainment center space. They're many good operators, but we think we started our journey in the family entertainment center with one of the best.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then just -- my second one was just staying on the pipeline of deals and so forth. So obviously, the tenure is much higher than I think most anticipated. And I'm just wondering, like when that happens, like how does that pipeline sort of evolve? Like do conversations stop? Do they pick up? Just trying to understand like what -- how is that pipeline evolving and conversations that you're having as PPR repricing capital?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, I'll start and then John and David can weigh in, but they definitely slow down, right? And anybody who doesn't slow conversations down against this backdrop of volatility clearly is not paying attention. A slowdown in terms of actual coming to any kind of fixing of value and price given the volatility of capital, but I want to turn it over to John because what we don't want to do is ever put all pens down -- not all pen out, but stop all conversations because there will come a day, as I said in my opening remarks, Ron, there will come a day when we begin to recover, and we don't want to have to call people and say, hey, you probably forgot about us because we haven't talked in months, quarters, years, what have you. We don't want to do that. So John, if you want to talk about the way in which we make sure our conversations continue even if they have to slow down a bit in terms of fixing value.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Ed, you described it very well. We're constantly looking for opportunities to have conversations, learn more about certain sectors and businesses that we're not experts on today, develop long-term partnerships. But that doesn't mean we transact at this moment of uncertainty. It means that we're preparing for the time when they hopefully go from defense to offense and look at opportunities that we understand the sector of the company and we develop that relationship. So a little bit of a different time than the past couple of years, but we still are working to find opportunities for the long term.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. That's it for me. Thanks so much.\nJohn Payne: Thank you, Ron.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi, morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on Bowlero and this is not intended to be a leading question in any way, but I know you do a lot of homework around the business and the underlying real estate. I wonder if you could just talk about the durability of that real estate value, what kind of it requires relative to the other stuff that you've acquired so far? And just sort of give us a picture of that long-term value durability, please?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, David, it's David. Good to talk. I can start, and John, chime in. I mean one of the things we love about the Bowlero business model is the fact that they go in and reposition bowling outs that have been around not for hundreds of years like Ed talked about, but these assets are 10- to 50-plus years old that they buy and reposition with anywhere from $3 million to $5 million of capital and transform something that was dark and gray and a little bit dated into a very lively experience that, as John talked about, has multiple cash registers and as a draw for the local community. And they've done this now since the late '90s, and they have a portfolio of 350 assets across the country and some outside of the U.S., where they continue to see opportunity to grow in white space out there, a very fragmented mom-and-pop ownership industry, they see opportunities for another 500 to 1,000 centers into their portfolio over time. And that's what we like about it. But [technical difficulty] to your question, David, is they take a box that's very solid and make it even better and make it essentially brand new. And that's what we love about the business model. And then the cash flows that come out of that business, as John said, have very high margins and very sticky recreation aspect to the cash flows.\nEdward Pitoniak: David, I'll just add to this. You and I talk a lot about my old days, way back in ski resort operations. And what I learned back in ski resort is to fall in love with businesses that respond that respond intensively and quickly to capital investment and management focus and intensity. And the difference between this and the ski business is you can make a great capital investment and operate the heck out of the business. I mean it doesn't snow you or. And what I love about this business is that it's very responsive to the investment of capital. You invest capital and you get pretty much an immediate consumer response it's also a business that responds really well to management intensity. And again, Tom Shannon and the Bowlero team are very, very trued at investing capital and know how to manage the P&L every single line, top, middle and bottom lines to drive -- to use that management intensity to really transform results through the transformation of the experience.\nJohn Payne: David, the only other thing I would mention is just the detail of our underwriting. We went to all 38 assets in the 17 states. We got to meet not only the senior management team, as I talked about, but our team got to meet the people on the ground that makes these assets so productive. And it helped us in continuing to understand the durability of the business and the asset. So that just gives you a flavor of how we went about this investment.\nDavid Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, good morning. So first question, Ed, maybe, John, it sounds like the company may slow down on investments in the near term until visibility improves, which would make sense. But the ongoing conversations that you are having as you look to keep the lines open, with new and existing relationships on potential opportunities. Do you expect to see investment yields increase sort of commensurate with the increases in capital costs across industries?\nEdward Pitoniak: Todd, I believe they will, but it always takes time. Sellers always tend to take more time to come to grips with reality than buyers would be sellers, would be buyers. And obviously, we've seen some cap rate expansion over the last year. And I'm very confident in telling you that a year ago, we would not have been able to buy 38 Bowlero assets at a 7.3% cap rate. Very confident that we could not have done that. These assets would have traded tighter a year ago as they traded considerably tighter a couple of years ago when Carlyle bought a large portfolio of Bowlero assets. So as we look over the year to come and maybe years to come, I think you can expect markets eventually to accept realities, but markets tend to take time to accept those realities, and we'll be patient for that acceptance to take place and enjoy the benefits of same-store growth that we, as a net lease REIT enjoy to a very rare degree thanks to our lease escalation and especially the CPI component of that escalation. Same-store growth is going to mean something in the net lease space over the next year if things slowdown in the way they might. And we'll cite a report from our friends at Green Street that showed that both VICI and GLPI enjoy same-store NOI growth that is about 4x the standard net lease REIT.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess within that context of sort of looking at potential investments, can you provide an update on the call right agreements and sort of current thinking on Hoosier Park and Horseshoe, Indianapolis, the potential timing there and how you're thinking about potential capital raising that might be required to the extent something were to happen there?\nEdward Pitoniak: David take that first. The last half of that first and then John can take the first half.\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Todd. And those who have been with us since the beginning, in the early days, we had call rights at a 10 cap. And as we talked about then, we said we'd use those to layer into our growth when the pipeline may be slower or there may be less opportunities in the marketplace. And we take the same approach with the call rights in Indiana. That runs till the end of next year, end of 2024, and we just have to call it by the end of 2024. So as we look into the future, we'll be very disciplined with where our cost of capital is, but also very kind of methodical about how we layer in into our future AFFO growth.\nJohn Payne: And then on the operating side, we just -- like we do with our current assets that we own. We're continuing to monitor how the business is performing in Indianapolis. As I've mentioned on other calls, Caesars has put in significant capital to both the assets and those businesses continue to be rewarded based on those capital improvements. So we'll continue to monitor that.\nTodd Thomas: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nGreg McGinniss: Hi, good morning. Looking at the future opportunities with Canyon Ranch or Bowlero, is finding the incremental investment contingent upon the operator? Or is your team working with them to help find some opportunities. And then also for any potential ROFOs or investments, those cap rates will be negotiated in real time. So can we assume maybe those would be 50, 100 basis points higher than where you've invested previously?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, Greg, it's a good question. And to take the first part of your question, we very much partner with our partners like Canyon Ranch at developing investment criteria applying those criteria to marketplace to figure out where the best opportunities may be. And I think I mentioned back when we announced our -- the expansion of our Canyon Ranch partnership back in late July, that John Goff and I share a conviction that the coming years, '24, '25, '26 and onward, could represent the kind of opportunity that John Goff and Richard Rainwater saw in the Resolution Trust days in the early 90s. There could be some very compelling acquisition opportunities that are born out of not necessarily operating distress, but what could be a certain element of financing stress. So we're excited about that. We're patient. We're willing to wait for the right opportunities to come along in that vein. And when it comes to figuring out pricing and ROFOs and call rights, I think what we're increasingly focused on is the degree to which we may need a certain amount of flexibility between us as buyer and any would-be seller account for the unpredictability of capital cost and resulting values. So we're going to be careful that we don't lock in to a cap rate for a future acquisition that may turn out at that time to be dilutive.\nGreg McGinniss: And I guess in looking at those potential Canyon Ranch opportunities, is there a around the balance size on a per asset basis that they're looking at in terms of making investments? Obviously, that will change based on cost of capital and expect -- but just trying to understand the size of the assets they're looking at.\nDavid Kieske: Greg, it's David, good to talk again. Thanks for joining the call. For our canning range, it's somewhere 120 to maybe 150 rooms, but kind of 30, sweet spot. One of the things is they want to insure asset utilization. So if you look at Lenox and Tucson in the room counts right around there, what they're working on and developing in Austin will be right around that size. And so as we think about potential other dots on the map, whether it be ski or beach or potentially even international one day, it's how do you find -- how do you focus on assets of that size? And given the economic magnitude or vitality that comes out of that business, you can take a conventional hotel that has similar room sizes and make the economics so much greater and so much better than what was out of a traditional hotel. And so that's part of the excitement part of the opportunity that we potentially see together in the future. And some of the distress or malaise that may be coming from that sector.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And just a final one for me. may not have an answer on this one, but have you guys been in talks with MGM about their perceived likelihood of receiving the license at Empire City and your potential investment there? Any updates?\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. We -- well, first of all, MGM has been a great partner since we were able to acquire MGP and those assets. And obviously, the New York process is going on right now. There's some who believe, as you said, that the two current racinos will get two of the three licenses. And should MGM be one of those, and they're looking to build that business, and we see an opportunity to use our capital to build and get incremental rent. We'll absolutely talk to the partner about that. So we'll just have to see grain how this process plays out over the coming years.\nGreg McGinniss: All right. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is open.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about how you think about the scope of the opportunity with Bowlero over time, I guess, against coverage levels, I think you said about 3.2x coverage. So a lot of cushion in there, but where would you sort of be comfortable, I guess, continuing to kind of buy up their EBITDA and converting it into rent relative to the coverage levels.\nDavid Kieske: Smedes we studied -- as you heard us say, we studied the business in the company for a couple of years now. And the their ability to go into an asset with very low 4-wall coverage and transformed that asset into very high 4-wall coverage, gives us a lot of conviction in the business. And then obviously, with the master lease and the corporate guarantee that we get out of the -- incremental protection we get gives us a lot of comfort. So that's the area that we target, how kind of high 2s, 4-wall coverage, low 3s and then obviously, the corporate guarantee. And they're a growth-minded operator who understands the merits of a sale-leaseback model and ensures that they have the capital available to grow their business and the way shapes or forms that they want to do and they want to size the rent in a way that gives them protection to make sure that they're creating and benefiting from all the upside that they generate, given their business model and the economics that they do produce.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask about the balance sheet. Leverage just ticked up slightly to 5.7 from 5.6. And you still have the split rating between S&P and Moody's. What do you think are kind of -- what's the kind of the path, I guess, with Moody's? I mean did they want to see continued diverse diversification away from gaming? Or -- and I guess, kind of what's the sort of leverage metric that you think that they would need to see in order to move into investment grade?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Smedes, just to hit on your first point. I mean the leverage ticked up quarter-over-quarter really good cash went down, right? If you look at our supplement quarter-over-quarter debt only went up $55 million. That was the fund of Century Canada asset and cash went down $230 million. As Ed talked about the equity and the cash out the door to fund the acquisitions that we closed during the quarter. So really a de minimis move in leverage Look, in terms of Moody's, it's a continual education and it's just -- it takes time, all right? We've been around for six years. We're educating the agencies on the gaming net lease model educating Moody's in particular, on gaming tenants. And as we've talked about, I think with many of you in the past, they took our rating up two notches when we did our inaugural investment grade offering back in April of 2022, we've been in touch with them consistently, and we will -- for an agency to make a move, it often takes an event. So we're hopeful in the coming months or a period of time, there will be an acknowledgment of the sanctity of our cash flows and an upgrade coming. And it's -- there's really no real kind of black and white trigger. It's a little bit of just do what you say, say what you do and continue to prove the merits of your business model, which we have been very, very diligent and working hard at.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Darling with Green Street. Your line is open.\nChris Darling: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Going back to the pricing environment, but thinking about traditional gaming real estate, specifically. It seems like there's been this dynamic over the past, call it, 18 months or so, where gaming real estate has been positively repriced relative to traditional commercial real estate. And I wonder if that dynamic is still playing out in your mind? Or if you think cap rates are maybe moving in a more commensurate fashion 10-year right now?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, Chris, good to talk to you. I think the honest answer would be, we don't know. The most recent trade in big box gaming, obviously, was a realty income investment in Bellagio, where I believe it took place at - \nJohn Payne: 5.2%.\nEdward Pitoniak: 5.2% cap rate. So exactly to your point. There's not a lot of the real estate categories covered by Green Street, where you're seeing those kinds of cap rates right now, perhaps outside of industrial and maybe data centers. So there is resilience there. But beyond that Bellagio investment, I don't think we have a lot of data to point at. But I do think, going back to what John has been saying, about the vitality, especially of Las Vegas, where so much of our capital is invested. There's really no other place on or like it. And it may sound a bit trivial, but I'll point to, for instance, PINK, having just performed last week at Allegion announcing, I want a residency in Las Vegas, and I want it now because she's recognizing as a global artist that Las Vegas is the place for global artists to situate themselves right now because of the drawing power that Las Vegas has on a global basis. So you're seeing a resiliency of economic activity that should constitute some degree of resilience of value that you're not obviously going to see in a lot of other sectors where you are facing either secular headwinds or supply-demand imbalance.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Ed, the other thing that's unique in the gaming business right now than other businesses, right, is that the operating performance of a lot of these casinos, particularly in the city you called out in Las Vegas are doing incredibly well. right? So yes, there's a lot of volatility in the markets, but their core business is really performing quite well. So we'll see how this plays out.\nChris Darling: Appreciate all the thoughts. That\u2019s it for me.\nJohn Payne: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: We now turn to Nate Crossett with BNP. Your line is open.\nNate Crossett: Hi, good morning. Maybe just one quick one on the balance sheet. If you could just maybe remind us the guidance for your leverage band and then just address like talking about debt maturities for next year, I know you mentioned the swaps, but can you just tell us how you're thinking about addressing that maturity? What would the term be? And maybe where you think you could price money today?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Nate, it's David. It's a yes. I mean we've been very vocal and committed to getting leverage back to our 5x between 5x and 5.5x net debt to EBITDA Obviously, we ticked that up a little bit with the MGP acquisition and the agencies acknowledged that and understood we would work very hard to get that leverage back down and we've kind of exceeded the pace that we originally told the agencies in the summer of '21. And then in terms of our 10-year money, we do have a maturity that comes due May 1, 2024, the window opens on February 1, 2024. We talked about, as we've mentioned collectively, we have $450 million of notional forward starting swaps out there. We've been legging into a hedge policy to get ahead of that refinancing. That 10-year money today spreads somewhere 2.20, 2.30, give or take, 10 or 20 basis points over the 10-year. And so as we sit here today, with a 10-year 5, that's kind of low to mid-7s capital. But we'll assess the market is that a mix of 5, 7 or 10, is it all tens - we do have access to the term loan market that a lot of REITs do not have access to. So we'll be very focused on ensuring that we extend the tenor, but also take advantage of the kind of the best pricing and the best laddering of our maturities as possible.\nEdward Pitoniak: And I'll just reiterate, Nate, that while it does not obviously show up in trailing leverage numbers when we invest $1 billion of equity against only $55 million of debt on our recent accretive capital investments, it will obviously have a forward deleveraging effect.\nNate Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just one more on the Bowlero. I think it's about maybe 10% of their portfolio. Have they given you any indication how much they would be willing to do over time, just trying to like size the potential opportunity here?\nDavid Kieske: Well, as we sit here today, Nate, almost all of their assets are in a sale-leaseback format. So it would be potential future growth opportunities as they find opportunities in the marketplace. And one of the reason we were able to build a relationship and develop this transaction over time is VICI's desire to grow, VICI's access to capital. And obviously, Bowlero desire to grow. And as you saw in our materials and the commentary. If you look at the Bowlero announcements, they're very - they're thrilled with the deal that throw the partner with VICI and the we're optimistic there will be more to come together, but there's nothing directly off the Bowlero balance sheet as we sit here today.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. And I can't remember the exact numbers. So hopefully, David or John might, Nate. But the thing to keep in mind is that Valero is the market leader in a remarkably unconsolidated category with Valero owning - do they even own 10% of the category, I think they own 10%. So their opportunity to continue to roll up assets can transform the assets, transform the experiences and transform the economics is where the future growth between Bowlero and VICI will take place And again, thanks to a basically a right of first offer. What amounts to an exclusive financing partner restate financing partnership, that we'll enjoy with them for the next eight years.\nNate Crossett: Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: We now turn to Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me this morning. Different markets and countries are obviously going through different phases of economic cycles. And I know in the past, you've talked about growing outside of the U.S., understanding that these relationships take time - has anything changed in terms of how you're thinking about non-U.S. versus U.S. opportunities with respect to current cap rates, multiples relationships? Thanks.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. And I will point out as someone who carries both the Canadian Passport as well as U.S. passport, we have expanded internationally. Canada is another country and we're very proud to be invested there. And John and Kelyn and the business development team continue to research international markets as overall real estate marketplaces and then the categories of interest the experiential categories of interest within those markets. And again, those are situations where we will make sure to take the time and take great care to make wise investments given that they need to be based on deep knowledge of the market before we ever commit capital.\nChad Beynon: Appreciate it.\nEdward Pitoniak: I think, Elliot, that will wrap things up, correct?\nOperator: Yes, this concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to Edward Pitoniak, CEO for closing remarks.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you, Elliot. Thanks, everybody, on the call today. We really appreciate you being with us, and we wish all of you the best during this very, very volatile time. It is a time we will get through. And again, we thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2023 is a quarter most REITs are happy to be done with. The REIT Index in Q3 2023 was down 8%, swinging negative for the year after not a great year last year, and October has only continued a negative trend. But while the REIT stock marketplace didn't have a great quarter in Q3 2023, the key question to ask is what a given REIT did in Q3 and now in October to improve its business for the future. At VICI, our answer to this question has a number of elements to it. We played offense selectively. We played defense. We capitalized on certain current conditions. We prepared for potential future conditions. We increased our dividend effective with Q3 2023 and an annualized rate that well exceeds forward inflation expectations and continued rate of dividend growth since 2019 and that is 3x greater than the largest net lease REIT over the same period. And if there has ever been a period in which one should value a solidly covered and solidly growing dividend, that currently exceeds the 10-year rate. This is it. Finally, in a year in which REIT earnings growth has generally been difficult to come by, VICI's AFFO per share earnings in Q3 grew 10.7% year-over-year. VICI announced within and subsequent to quarter-end, about $1.1 billion of new capital commitments. While most of you have seen the strategic and economic merits of these investments, we know there are some of you who feel that we should have left that capital in a stockpile. Some of you feel understandably that volatility is too high and visibility is too low. We agree volatility is high and visibility is low. And with the market movements of especially the last few weeks, we are sober and cautious about what the market conditions for capital allocation could be from here for how long, no one knows. But I can tell you that we continue to have high conviction about the commitments we've recently made with Century, with Canyon Ranch and now with Valero. These commitments represented immediately accretive investments in real estate that should have positive impacts on 2024 earnings. These commitments also represent investments in relationships that can and will be the answer in future years to, okay, now that things are back to normal, how are you going to grow, VICI. Again, none of us know when the all-clear signal will sound, but it will in some way and REITs that continue to invest in relationships we'll be best positioned to resume growing when market conditions and values have stabilized. That's what we at VICI did in the recovery out of COVID. Our situational readiness put us in the position to acquire the Venetian and MGP, investments that are a key driver of our 2023 earnings growth, and we made these investments and many other would be made [technical difficulty] hadn't been fully readying themselves for recovery. We have been able to undertake our recent investments because of the astute and agile work of Moira McCloskey and the VICI Capital Markets team. Going back to our nearly $1 billion overnight equity raise in early January 2023, VICI has opportunistically raised a total of approximately $1.3 billion of forward equity in 2023, giving VICI a cost of funds for our recent investments to drive the immediate accretion of which we've spoken. We also made defense this past quarter. During Q3 and subsequent to quarter-end, we played defense by using close to $1 billion of equity in cash and only about $55 million of debt to fund our new capital commitments demonstrating our commitment to our long-range leverage targets. David Kieske and the VICI Finance team also played defense by adding a further $200 million of swap protection since Q2 in anticipation of our 2024 refinancing of $1.05 billion of the legacy MGP 5.625 notes giving us a total of $450 million of swap protection. And while we did all this, our tenants continue to demonstrate the vitality of their businesses, as John will speak of momentarily. I'm very proud of the work the entire VICI team did this quarter against a volatile and difficult backdrop, the VICI team working within one of the lightest G&A loads of any S&P 500 REIT continue to create a culture of excellence and resilience that I'm confident will serve VICI's stakeholders well for years to come no matter what those years bring. With that, I'll turn the call over to John Payne for an operating and transaction marketplace update, and John will then pass the mic to David Kieske, who will give our financial and guidance update. John? I'd say generally, Tony, it has become more competitive. I think as you look at, obviously, the stock trading values of the operators, but also the yield to worst on much of their credit or our capital has the potential to be very compelling in 2024, 2025, 2026. But that, of course, assumes that our cost of capital is in a place where we can generate positive spreads and accretion against that. And our confidence level in predicting or projecting our cost of capital a year from now is not high. If anyone does have my confidence in their projections, please call us immediately and let us know what we're missing. John? Tony, if I understand your question correctly, I think you're asking us well, could there be opportunities downstream for us to buy incremental rent, if the operators' capital went into the creation of incremental real property. And yes, that could be an opportunity down the road should they want to monetize the value of the real property they created through their capital investments because it's all predicated, of course, on making sure we're buying good REIT income that is tied to the creation of incremental real property. Exactly right, Tony. Yes. I'll start, John, and then turn it over to John Payne. So when you look at our Bowlero transaction, it represents a number of different strategic initiatives. It obviously does, as you've already said, represent our initiation into a new category, into that new category, we significantly expand our TAM, and we do so by investing behind a highly superior business model that Tom Shannon and the Bowlero team have created and the growth opportunity they have to consolidate a very fragmented sector is very compelling to us. It is also a sector that obviously other REITs have invested in and could continue to invest in. So it is a somewhat more competitive marketplace with a consequent impact on cap rates than you might see in regional gaming. So it - there are times when gaming investments and nongaming investments can be a bit apple and orange-ish, if you will, given that they do represent different marketplaces with different characteristics. I do think the point of emphasis needs to be that the 7.3% cap rate was immediately accretive and a very positive spread to the cost of capital. David Moore and the team have raised over the course of 2023, and we're very excited about the growth opportunity going forward. John, do you have anything to add? I'll just add, Haendel. We've had a few questions along the lines of, well, geez, could you have used that money to buy 9 and 10 cap assets? And our answer to that would be today and especially during the period in which you were gestating the Bowlero deal, we don't see any really good real estate occupied by really good operators trading at 9 and 10 caps right now. The day could come when they do, but that day is not here right now. And in the meantime, with this capital volatility that we see, we will be very, very careful in recognizing that not only is the cost of capital volatile on a day-by-day basis, that has implications for any deals that have long gestation periods. So we will have to particularly take care any kind of deal making that requires longer gestation periods to account for the fact we do not have capital cost certainty by any means, and won't necessarily have it until the day we decide to do a deal, which means we will take great care in deciding to do anything against these market conditions. Yes. So you're right. Technically, that -- these do represent our first direct investments, immediate ownership of nongaming real estate. What we should point out, of course, is that through our ventures with Cabot and Canyon Ranch, we have contracted for call rights that give us a direct path to real estate ownership in the future. So it happens to just be a difference between the nature of our acquisition of real estate potential acquisition of real estate with Cabot and Canyon's Ranch versus the immediate acquisition with Bowlero. And certainly, in this case, you had an operator with a very compelling opportunity to grow, a very compelling opportunity to put sale-leaseback capital to work, which led to our immediate acquisition of the real estate itself. Yes. I'll turn it over to John in a moment, Ron, and good to hear from you. I do think one of the key characteristics of bowling is that it is a low barrier to entry experience, but it is an experience that you can get better at. And that's in contrast to some other experiences that can take place within the family entertainment sector, where people might do it once or twice, and they go, okay, fun. I've done that. I don't need to do it again. And Boeing is at its very heart recreation. And if you want to get philosophical about it, you can say, it goes back to our most ancient human urges to aim at a target and strike a target. And people tend to get pretty excited when they strike targets. And that energy exists within bowling. It's a recreational energy and not a passive energy. So we think that, that has resiliency aspects to it that are at the heart of why bowling has endured in various warrants for literally hundreds and hundreds of years, whether outdoor on lands or indoors and buildings. But I'll now turn it over to John, who can give you more color on how we develop that relationship. John? Yes, I'll start and then John and David can weigh in, but they definitely slow down, right? And anybody who doesn't slow conversations down against this backdrop of volatility clearly is not paying attention. A slowdown in terms of actual coming to any kind of fixing of value and price given the volatility of capital, but I want to turn it over to John because what we don't want to do is ever put all pens down -- not all pen out, but stop all conversations because there will come a day, as I said in my opening remarks, Ron, there will come a day when we begin to recover, and we don't want to have to call people and say, hey, you probably forgot about us because we haven't talked in months, quarters, years, what have you. We don't want to do that. So John, if you want to talk about the way in which we make sure our conversations continue even if they have to slow down a bit in terms of fixing value. David, I'll just add to this. You and I talk a lot about my old days, way back in ski resort operations. And what I learned back in ski resort is to fall in love with businesses that respond that respond intensively and quickly to capital investment and management focus and intensity. And the difference between this and the ski business is you can make a great capital investment and operate the heck out of the business. I mean it doesn't snow you or. And what I love about this business is that it's very responsive to the investment of capital. You invest capital and you get pretty much an immediate consumer response it's also a business that responds really well to management intensity. And again, Tom Shannon and the Bowlero team are very, very trued at investing capital and know how to manage the P&L every single line, top, middle and bottom lines to drive -- to use that management intensity to really transform results through the transformation of the experience. Todd, I believe they will, but it always takes time. Sellers always tend to take more time to come to grips with reality than buyers would be sellers, would be buyers. And obviously, we've seen some cap rate expansion over the last year. And I'm very confident in telling you that a year ago, we would not have been able to buy 38 Bowlero assets at a 7.3% cap rate. Very confident that we could not have done that. These assets would have traded tighter a year ago as they traded considerably tighter a couple of years ago when Carlyle bought a large portfolio of Bowlero assets. So as we look over the year to come and maybe years to come, I think you can expect markets eventually to accept realities, but markets tend to take time to accept those realities, and we'll be patient for that acceptance to take place and enjoy the benefits of same-store growth that we, as a net lease REIT enjoy to a very rare degree thanks to our lease escalation and especially the CPI component of that escalation. Same-store growth is going to mean something in the net lease space over the next year if things slowdown in the way they might. And we'll cite a report from our friends at Green Street that showed that both VICI and GLPI enjoy same-store NOI growth that is about 4x the standard net lease REIT. David take that first. The last half of that first and then John can take the first half. Yes, Greg, it's a good question. And to take the first part of your question, we very much partner with our partners like Canyon Ranch at developing investment criteria applying those criteria to marketplace to figure out where the best opportunities may be. And I think I mentioned back when we announced our -- the expansion of our Canyon Ranch partnership back in late July, that John Goff and I share a conviction that the coming years, '24, '25, '26 and onward, could represent the kind of opportunity that John Goff and Richard Rainwater saw in the Resolution Trust days in the early 90s. There could be some very compelling acquisition opportunities that are born out of not necessarily operating distress, but what could be a certain element of financing stress. So we're excited about that. We're patient. We're willing to wait for the right opportunities to come along in that vein. And when it comes to figuring out pricing and ROFOs and call rights, I think what we're increasingly focused on is the degree to which we may need a certain amount of flexibility between us as buyer and any would-be seller account for the unpredictability of capital cost and resulting values. So we're going to be careful that we don't lock in to a cap rate for a future acquisition that may turn out at that time to be dilutive. John? Yes, Chris, good to talk to you. I think the honest answer would be, we don't know. The most recent trade in big box gaming, obviously, was a realty income investment in Bellagio, where I believe it took place at - 5.2% cap rate. So exactly to your point. There's not a lot of the real estate categories covered by Green Street, where you're seeing those kinds of cap rates right now, perhaps outside of industrial and maybe data centers. So there is resilience there. But beyond that Bellagio investment, I don't think we have a lot of data to point at. But I do think, going back to what John has been saying, about the vitality, especially of Las Vegas, where so much of our capital is invested. There's really no other place on or like it. And it may sound a bit trivial, but I'll point to, for instance, PINK, having just performed last week at Allegion announcing, I want a residency in Las Vegas, and I want it now because she's recognizing as a global artist that Las Vegas is the place for global artists to situate themselves right now because of the drawing power that Las Vegas has on a global basis. So you're seeing a resiliency of economic activity that should constitute some degree of resilience of value that you're not obviously going to see in a lot of other sectors where you are facing either secular headwinds or supply-demand imbalance. And I'll just reiterate, Nate, that while it does not obviously show up in trailing leverage numbers when we invest $1 billion of equity against only $55 million of debt on our recent accretive capital investments, it will obviously have a forward deleveraging effect. Yes. And I can't remember the exact numbers. So hopefully, David or John might, Nate. But the thing to keep in mind is that Valero is the market leader in a remarkably unconsolidated category with Valero owning - do they even own 10% of the category, I think they own 10%. So their opportunity to continue to roll up assets can transform the assets, transform the experiences and transform the economics is where the future growth between Bowlero and VICI will take place And again, thanks to a basically a right of first offer. What amounts to an exclusive financing partner restate financing partnership, that we'll enjoy with them for the next eight years. Yes. And I will point out as someone who carries both the Canadian Passport as well as U.S. passport, we have expanded internationally. Canada is another country and we're very proud to be invested there. And John and Kelyn and the business development team continue to research international markets as overall real estate marketplaces and then the categories of interest the experiential categories of interest within those markets. And again, those are situations where we will make sure to take the time and take great care to make wise investments given that they need to be based on deep knowledge of the market before we ever commit capital. I think, Elliot, that will wrap things up, correct? Yes. Thank you, Elliot. Thanks, everybody, on the call today. We really appreciate you being with us, and we wish all of you the best during this very, very volatile time. It is a time we will get through. And again, we thank you for your time today."

            "content": "Thanks, Ed. While 2023 has been a volatile year in the real estate sector, as Ed just highlighted, we at VICI have put ourselves in the position on both a capital and relationship basis to not only continue our business but to expand it into new sectors, new relationships and new geographies. In the third quarter, we continued to grow with our partners at Century Casinos by closing our Rocky Gap Casino Resort acquisition in Maryland, and our sale leaseback of four gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, growing our international footprint. Subsequent to quarter-end, we were very excited to announce our entry into the family entertainment sector, through our acquisition of 38 bowling entertainment centers with our new partners at Valero, led by Tom Shannon and Brett Parker, the Valero team is a perfect example of a talented growth-minded operator that has a deep understanding of their consumer recreational trends and the value that a VICI relationship and our capital can bring to their growth strategies. VICI's tenants are not only continuing to show strong operating results, but are also continuing to invest in capital improvements all over the United States. Caesars is investing over $400 million into just one asset, Harrah's New Orleans. The Venetian just announced a $1 billion plan to further enhance our asset, including almost $200 million in just convention center space. MGM spends hundreds of millions of dollars in CapEx each year on assets throughout Las Vegas and the regional markets. And even our smallest operators are investing millions of dollars each year on growth projects, thereby enhancing the quality of our assets and the productivity of their operating businesses. These reinvestment commitments add to our conviction that we are continuing to construct a high-quality portfolio of assets with the best experiential operators for our investors. This high-quality classification comes from not only the quality of the real estate itself, but also from the outsized productivity of these assets, productivity that is hard to come by in almost any other real estate sector. No place highlights the health and productivity of our tenants better than Las Vegas. After meeting with Caesar's CEO, Tom Reeg at G2E, which is the largest gaming conference in the United States, one analyst noted that Caesars is on pace for its best October ever. And this is against the backdrop of current macroeconomic uncertainty. Even during these tough times, Las Vegas continues to open new world-class attractions while diversifying its revenue stream and customer base. The opening of the must-see entertainment venue, the sphere world famous events like Formula 1 and the 2024 Super Bowl and a diverse and robust convention and conference schedule all helped showcase that there's no city performing like Las Vegas, that has clearly become the entertainment epicenter of the world. Outside of Las Vegas, regional performance has continued to be resilient, while many operators in our discussions have cited increased expenses related to items such as insurance or unrated play normalizing against tough comps, regional operations continue to run at very strong profit levels supported by loyal consumers with their respective database. Strategically, we continue to be focused on all fronts: gaming, nongaming, domestic and international to grow our pipeline for VICI's future. In gaming, Danny Valoy and I are in constant dialogue with new potential partners domestically and internationally, and we are just as excited by the ways we can potentially help our current tenants grow through additional tuck-in acquisitions or by utilizing our partner property growth fund in which we seek to fund our tenants high ROI opportunities at our existing assets. Meanwhile, Kellen Floral has been cultivating invaluable connections and relationships across the family entertainment, sport, wellness, leisure and recreation sectors as we continue pursuing our mission to be the real estate capital partner of choice to best-in-class growth minding operators of unique social infrastructure properties. During this most challenging time of market volatility for everyone, it is more important than ever for our team to continue to grow and deepen our networks and to grow our breadth of opportunities to best position for the years to come. This work is intended to position us to continue to deliver the growth our shareholders have come to expect from the VICI team. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David? Yes. Tony, just to level set here, Tony, the capital that I went through in my opening remarks is being put in by the tenant, not by VICI at this time, just to - and I think that's what you were asking. The other point of the question is if there's opportunities for us to help them with larger projects in this property growth fund would we do that? We would be thoughtful in our analytics behind an investment, and we talk to our partners all the time about how they're thinking about growing their businesses and is there an opportunity for us to deploy incremental capital for incremental rent. And we do that on an ongoing basis. Yes, John, I just mentioned you asked about other categories that we're looking at. Obviously, we've already placed investments in indoor water parks, wellness with Canyon Ranch, Pilgrimage Golf, we made an investment in family entertainment center, as you said, with Bowlero. But we continue to spend some time looking for opportunities to develop long-term partnerships in wellness, leisure, recreation, some entertainment sectors and some sports sectors as well. And I think it's important. The final thing I'll just add is it's not an either or it's not a pay, you're looking at gaming, and that's what we're just focused on. And you're looking at wellness and that's what you've spoken on. We've got the capacity now to constantly look for these unique opportunities to place investments over time, as Ed mentioned in his opening remarks. It has not changed, but you hit on the sphere with what an amazing entertainment venue that was added to Las Vegas and sits on our land. It is truly - there's no entertainment venue like it, not only in the United States, but probably the world. But this is a category that we have looked at. We continue to study. We clearly have not made an investment, and we're trying to better understand the long-term economics and viability of certain projects. But boy, the sphere is amazing, John, if you get the opportunity, you should go to an event there. Thank you, John. Yes, Ron, I was just going to add that you've heard me speak about times that relationships take time. And this is one that I think I looked at my notes in my first meeting was years ago with one of the top executives at Bowlero. And we just studied the business for this long. It's got scale. It's got healthy credit -- it's a business that has great margin with growth potential. The one other thing I'll add to Ed's remarks, as we continue to study the Bowlero business was the diversification of its revenue streams. It has many cash registers how the business can get into the consumer's wallet. It gets revenues from food and beverage. It gets a large percentage from bowling, it gets business revenues from amusement. So we like that diversification as we dug into the business and dug into the team. So we really took time years in this case to understand the business. And then I think your final part was are there other operators over time that we could buy real estate and be partners with. And we're going to continue to study the family entertainment center space. They're many good operators, but we think we started our journey in the family entertainment center with one of the best. Yes. Ed, you described it very well. We're constantly looking for opportunities to have conversations, learn more about certain sectors and businesses that we're not experts on today, develop long-term partnerships. But that doesn't mean we transact at this moment of uncertainty. It means that we're preparing for the time when they hopefully go from defense to offense and look at opportunities that we understand the sector of the company and we develop that relationship. So a little bit of a different time than the past couple of years, but we still are working to find opportunities for the long term. Thank you, Ron. David, the only other thing I would mention is just the detail of our underwriting. We went to all 38 assets in the 17 states. We got to meet not only the senior management team, as I talked about, but our team got to meet the people on the ground that makes these assets so productive. And it helped us in continuing to understand the durability of the business and the asset. So that just gives you a flavor of how we went about this investment. And then on the operating side, we just -- like we do with our current assets that we own. We're continuing to monitor how the business is performing in Indianapolis. As I've mentioned on other calls, Caesars has put in significant capital to both the assets and those businesses continue to be rewarded based on those capital improvements. So we'll continue to monitor that. Yes. We -- well, first of all, MGM has been a great partner since we were able to acquire MGP and those assets. And obviously, the New York process is going on right now. There's some who believe, as you said, that the two current racinos will get two of the three licenses. And should MGM be one of those, and they're looking to build that business, and we see an opportunity to use our capital to build and get incremental rent. We'll absolutely talk to the partner about that. So we'll just have to see grain how this process plays out over the coming years. 5.2%. Yes. Ed, the other thing that's unique in the gaming business right now than other businesses, right, is that the operating performance of a lot of these casinos, particularly in the city you called out in Las Vegas are doing incredibly well. right? So yes, there's a lot of volatility in the markets, but their core business is really performing quite well. So we'll see how this plays out. Thank you, Chris."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today. The VICI team takes pride in what we've accomplished in 2023, acknowledging the year is not over, but the results we posted last night and last week's Bowlero announcement are exemplary of those accomplishments, as Ed said, we are improving the business, which should benefit VICI and you as shareholders as to 2024 and beyond. Highlighting the transaction we closed last week with Bowlero and we have spoken to many of you about, the deal was immediately accretive to our AFFO given we had prepared by raising forward equity for the transaction many months earlier generating an attractive spread to that cost of capital. From an economic standpoint, the deal is very attractive. But as John mentioned, it also builds a partnership with a market leader that we and the Bowlero team believe will grow together in the future. Subsequent to funding this transaction, we have approximately $3 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $430 million in cash, $250 million of estimated net proceeds available under our forward sale agreements and $2.3 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In terms of net leverage, net debt to annualized Q3 adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.35% accounting for our hedge portfolio and a weighted average of 6.1 years to maturity. Then as we prepare for our first bond refinancing in early 2024, we have entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $450 million to date. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of nearly 11% compared to $0.49 for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $14.4 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.6%, one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend of $0.415 per share or $1.66 on an annualized basis, representing a 6.4% year-over-year increase. Then turning to guidance. We are updating and increasing AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis year ending December 31, 2023, is now expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.18 billion or between $2.14 and $2.15 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 11%, one of the highest expected growth rates across all REITs. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transaction items. And as a reminder, we do record a noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Elliott, please open the line for questions. Haendel, it's David. Good to talk to you. No, that is absolutely still the case in this environment. And as we talked about, obviously, we were fortunate to raise the capital this for the Bowlero transaction, specifically earlier in the year when, in fact, the Bowlero was in our pipeline back then things take weeks, months and time to come together. But we're not -- is not in the sand as we sit here today. If we look at the screen, see where the tenure is. We obviously see where our stock price is and still are on generating those types of 100 to 150 basis point spreads to our cost of capital. As we think about it, we think about the next dollar of cost of capital, where do we need to price something make it accretive based on the market that we are in and underwriting at that time and the capital that we have available to us. Yes, David, it's David. Good to talk. I can start, and John, chime in. I mean one of the things we love about the Bowlero business model is the fact that they go in and reposition bowling outs that have been around not for hundreds of years like Ed talked about, but these assets are 10- to 50-plus years old that they buy and reposition with anywhere from $3 million to $5 million of capital and transform something that was dark and gray and a little bit dated into a very lively experience that, as John talked about, has multiple cash registers and as a draw for the local community. And they've done this now since the late '90s, and they have a portfolio of 350 assets across the country and some outside of the U.S., where they continue to see opportunity to grow in white space out there, a very fragmented mom-and-pop ownership industry, they see opportunities for another 500 to 1,000 centers into their portfolio over time. And that's what we like about it. But [technical difficulty] to your question, David, is they take a box that's very solid and make it even better and make it essentially brand new. And that's what we love about the business model. And then the cash flows that come out of that business, as John said, have very high margins and very sticky recreation aspect to the cash flows. Yes, Todd. And those who have been with us since the beginning, in the early days, we had call rights at a 10 cap. And as we talked about then, we said we'd use those to layer into our growth when the pipeline may be slower or there may be less opportunities in the marketplace. And we take the same approach with the call rights in Indiana. That runs till the end of next year, end of 2024, and we just have to call it by the end of 2024. So as we look into the future, we'll be very disciplined with where our cost of capital is, but also very kind of methodical about how we layer in into our future AFFO growth. Greg, it's David, good to talk again. Thanks for joining the call. For our canning range, it's somewhere 120 to maybe 150 rooms, but kind of 30, sweet spot. One of the things is they want to insure asset utilization. So if you look at Lenox and Tucson in the room counts right around there, what they're working on and developing in Austin will be right around that size. And so as we think about potential other dots on the map, whether it be ski or beach or potentially even international one day, it's how do you find -- how do you focus on assets of that size? And given the economic magnitude or vitality that comes out of that business, you can take a conventional hotel that has similar room sizes and make the economics so much greater and so much better than what was out of a traditional hotel. And so that's part of the excitement part of the opportunity that we potentially see together in the future. And some of the distress or malaise that may be coming from that sector. Smedes we studied -- as you heard us say, we studied the business in the company for a couple of years now. And the their ability to go into an asset with very low 4-wall coverage and transformed that asset into very high 4-wall coverage, gives us a lot of conviction in the business. And then obviously, with the master lease and the corporate guarantee that we get out of the -- incremental protection we get gives us a lot of comfort. So that's the area that we target, how kind of high 2s, 4-wall coverage, low 3s and then obviously, the corporate guarantee. And they're a growth-minded operator who understands the merits of a sale-leaseback model and ensures that they have the capital available to grow their business and the way shapes or forms that they want to do and they want to size the rent in a way that gives them protection to make sure that they're creating and benefiting from all the upside that they generate, given their business model and the economics that they do produce. Yes, Smedes, just to hit on your first point. I mean the leverage ticked up quarter-over-quarter really good cash went down, right? If you look at our supplement quarter-over-quarter debt only went up $55 million. That was the fund of Century Canada asset and cash went down $230 million. As Ed talked about the equity and the cash out the door to fund the acquisitions that we closed during the quarter. So really a de minimis move in leverage Look, in terms of Moody's, it's a continual education and it's just -- it takes time, all right? We've been around for six years. We're educating the agencies on the gaming net lease model educating Moody's in particular, on gaming tenants. And as we've talked about, I think with many of you in the past, they took our rating up two notches when we did our inaugural investment grade offering back in April of 2022, we've been in touch with them consistently, and we will -- for an agency to make a move, it often takes an event. So we're hopeful in the coming months or a period of time, there will be an acknowledgment of the sanctity of our cash flows and an upgrade coming. And it's -- there's really no real kind of black and white trigger. It's a little bit of just do what you say, say what you do and continue to prove the merits of your business model, which we have been very, very diligent and working hard at. Yes, Nate, it's David. It's a yes. I mean we've been very vocal and committed to getting leverage back to our 5x between 5x and 5.5x net debt to EBITDA Obviously, we ticked that up a little bit with the MGP acquisition and the agencies acknowledged that and understood we would work very hard to get that leverage back down and we've kind of exceeded the pace that we originally told the agencies in the summer of '21. And then in terms of our 10-year money, we do have a maturity that comes due May 1, 2024, the window opens on February 1, 2024. We talked about, as we've mentioned collectively, we have $450 million of notional forward starting swaps out there. We've been legging into a hedge policy to get ahead of that refinancing. That 10-year money today spreads somewhere 2.20, 2.30, give or take, 10 or 20 basis points over the 10-year. And so as we sit here today, with a 10-year 5, that's kind of low to mid-7s capital. But we'll assess the market is that a mix of 5, 7 or 10, is it all tens - we do have access to the term loan market that a lot of REITs do not have access to. So we'll be very focused on ensuring that we extend the tenor, but also take advantage of the kind of the best pricing and the best laddering of our maturities as possible. Well, as we sit here today, Nate, almost all of their assets are in a sale-leaseback format. So it would be potential future growth opportunities as they find opportunities in the marketplace. And one of the reason we were able to build a relationship and develop this transaction over time is VICI's desire to grow, VICI's access to capital. And obviously, Bowlero desire to grow. And as you saw in our materials and the commentary. If you look at the Bowlero announcements, they're very - they're thrilled with the deal that throw the partner with VICI and the we're optimistic there will be more to come together, but there's nothing directly off the Bowlero balance sheet as we sit here today."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to talk this morning about our Q2 2023 results featuring a year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 11.9%, which we believe will be among the higher growth rates for S&P 500 REITs for Q2 2023, and yet at one of the lowest price to earnings growth ratios, PEG or PEG plus yield ratios among the S&P 500 REITs. For the course of the call, John will share with you what we're doing strategically to continue our growth, and David will give you details on our liquidity position, our Q2 2023 results and our updated earnings outlook to year-end.  I will now spend a few minutes on the exciting news we shared last night with the announcement of our significantly expanded growth partnership with Canyon Ranch, a legendary and leading brand in the place-based wellness sector. Indeed, I'm excited to say that the VICI team is conducting this call from Canyon Ranch Lennox in the beautiful Berkshires in Massachusetts. The key elements of our expanded Canyon Ranch partnership are BG making an up to $150 million preferred equity investment in the Canyon Ranch operating company to support the expansion of the Canyon Ranch operating and digital platforms as well as enhancements to the Tucson and Lenox assets. VICI also intends to provide approximately $150 million of mortgage financing secured by Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox to refinance Canyon Ranch's existing CMBS debt. With this refinancing serving as a bridge to enhancing VICI's embedded growth pipeline by specifically allowing for VICI's conversion of its existing purchase options on Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox, which are converting to call rights, whereby VICI can elect to acquire the real estate assets of Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox in the coming years, subject to certain conditions, with Canyon Ranch continuing to operate the assets under long-term triple net leases. This also includes VICI's previously announced commitment to provide up to $200 million of development funding for Canyon Ranch Austin, which is scheduled to open between 2025 and 2026 with a call right to own the real estate upon stabilization. And finally, the joint development of a strategy of identifying and potentially acquiring conventional resorts that have conversion potential to new Canyon Ranch resorts with Canyon Ranch operating the resorts and VICI owning the resort real estate under a long-term triple net lease.  Canyon Ranch has nearly 45 years of operating history. It serves a highly affluent clientele that invest vigorously through all cycles in medical and holistic life enhancement experiences and services. With only 2 established destination resort locations, we believe Canyon Ranch is positioned to significantly expand its clientele and its geography domestically and internationally. We are investing in Canyon Ranch to help fund and energize that expansion gaining through our partnership the opportunity to fund the acquisition and integration of new Canyon Ranch Resorts. Under the leadership of CEO, Jeff Kuster, the Canyon Ranch team is poised to grow its brand reach and network breadth, both programmatically and geographically. And of all the elements of our expanded partnership with Canyon Ranch, John Goff, Canyon Ranch's [indiscernible] and I are most excited about network expansion in the years ahead. Both John Goff and I believe that the conventional resort sector could see elements of distress in the next few years, less to do with operating performance and more to do with refinancing constriction.  As we have pointed out in our transaction deck, which can be found at www.viciproperties.com, more than $37 billion of resort and hotel CMBS financing will come due from 2024 through 2028. And I should point out that, that's only a fraction of the overall mortgage financing on U.S. hotels and resorts during this period. We believe that within those billions of dollars, our resorts that could meet Canon Ranch's conversion criteria.  The conversion of a conventional resort to a Canyon Ranch Resort has the potential to be transformative thanks to the capital and operating dynamics of the Canyon Ranch economic model. The Canyon Ranch model centers on maximizing the guest experience of space, indoors and out, and maximizing the guest experience of time through Canyon Ranch's holistic wellness and life enhancement offerings. This maximization of experiences leads to a revenue intensity within the Canyon Ranch model that surpasses the economic intensity of a conventional resort, potentially giving Canyon Ranch and VICI competitive advantage in acquiring and realizing value out of resort locations meeting our criteria. I believe our growth opportunity with Canyon Ranch is a generational opportunity in multiple senses of generational. Wellness is a secular growth trend that is multigenerational in its consumer profile and generational in terms of its secular outlook and growth opportunity. And Canyon Ranch Resorts are real estate built to last for generations.  At VICI, we invest in partnerships and real estate assets that will preserve and grow value for many generations to come. As you look across the spectrum of S&P 500 REITs, ask yourself is the real estate of high-quality and generational durability? And does the real estate enjoy the benefit of cultural and demographic tailwinds that will sustain and grow the value of the real estate for generations come? With VICI, I believe you get high-quality enduring real estate occupied by operators serving multiple generations of customers for generations to come. We believe our expanded partnership with Canyon Ranch is a superb example of this value proposition.  With that, over to you, John Payne.\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. Ed makes an excellent point on the quality enduring aspects of VICI's portfolio. Our tenants continue to prove their operational excellence and their ability to innovate and evolve their business. And importantly, for VICI, their assets as well. The results that continue to come out of Las Vegas speak to our tenants' operational quality and the operating credit, which we believe accrues to the value of our real estate. I will touch on Las Vegas in the gaming sector shortly. But I wanted to emphasize the type of portfolio we have built and that the team continues to build at VICI. These characteristics are a core focus of our strategy as we meet potential partners in gaming and nongaming experiential sectors, both domestically and internationally.  To recap our second quarter and subsequent activity, VICI continued its international expansion into Canada with our announcement of the acquisition of 4 gaming assets from Century Casino in Alberta. We also closed on the acquisition of the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Maryland this week, again with Century Casinos. Our partnership with Century is a great example of the type of operators we look for as the relationship is a win-win for both businesses as we grow together. Canyon Ranch also exemplifies the type of growth-minded partner with operational excellence and place-based wellness. As as described earlier, we are very excited to deepen and expand the relationship into the future.  Growing with our partners as they look to enhance and expand their businesses is a core component of our strategy as we develop and deepen our relationships across gaming and the non-gaming sectors. This approach helps VICI continue to grow a more visible pipeline into our future with operators we value and we trust. It also allows VICI to build a portfolio of assets with each partner that we believe can meaningfully impact VICI's growth over time. In the gaming sector, we continue to be impressed by our tenants. They exemplify the operational excellence we seek to find as we expand into other sectors. In what other sector right now, can you find a headline that reads \"Another all-time record result, but in line with consensus.\" Las Vegas has remained at or near all-time highs in terms of margins and results and is continuing to see record traffic. Regional casinos are performing well as the high-value consumer segment remains quite healthy. We continue to see many domestic real estate opportunities in gaming, including in markets where we do not currently own assets and as the industry expands its footprint into new areas of the United States. We also remain focused on international opportunities with the team traveling the globe this year, meeting new potential partners. As VICI's brand has ascended the funnel of opportunities has expanded in both gaming and non-gaming. We've added resources to meet the expanded funnel of opportunities. And as always, we work closely with our advisers and those in the VICI network to help force multiply our ability to create and evaluate opportunities.  For nongaming, we are intensely studying various sectors at a category level and operating level and at an asset level. Notably, in the family entertainment and sports categories, we're moving past the evaluation stage and into constructive discussions on how VICI's capital can fit best with our growing relationships. As you know, our relationships at VICI are at the heart of our success, and they take time to cultivate as we aim to find the best solutions that meet the goals of both sides, especially in an ever-evolving economic and capital markets environment. We're excited about how these relationships are developing.  The VICI team has been hard at work this year, building relationships and opportunities for a pipeline of growth across multiple sectors and geographies in the years to come. We are focused on partnering with best-in-class growth-minded operators with whom VICI can continue to grow our high-quality and generational real estate portfolio. We worked tirelessly to deliver results to our shareholders, evidenced by the last 5.5 years.  Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. I'll keep my remarks brief as we want to leave as much time for everyone's questions, but I do want to touch on our liquidity and our updated full year guidance. We are constantly focusing and at times obsessing on the balance sheet as we work to bring our leverage back down to our target range of 5 to 5.5x, while ensuring we have the dry powder to continue to fund accretive growth for our shareholders. We are diligently working with the agencies to improve our credit ratings over time, lower our cost of capital while balancing the right leverage for the company.  At quarter end, we had approximately $4 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $740 million in cash, $870 million of net proceeds available under our forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we settled approximately $190 million in shares under our forward sale agreements to fund the closing of Rocky Gap.  In terms of leverage, net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.6x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.4 years to maturity.  Turning to the income statement. AFFO per share was $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of nearly 12% compared to $0.48 for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.  Turning to guidance. We are updating AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is now expected to be between $2.13 billion and $2.16 billion or between $2.11 and $2.14 per diluted common share. Just to reiterate, based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 10%, one of the highest growth rates across REIT brands.  And as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. And as we've discussed with you in the past, we reported noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused and -- as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the product -- productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: Congratulations on Canyon Ranch. But -- my first question is actually on Bellagio and news around that, that was out around the quarter. Can you just maybe give us your view on how you would think about a transaction like that or the appetite to do something of that nature?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Tony, I'll start and John and David can chime in as they wish. I want to answer that question at the level of general principles. We take great care in how we acquire and that care manifests itself in us not attempting to buy what we can accretively pay for. And so we evaluate every situation on the basis of can we create value for our investors straight out of the gate. Our net lease model is a model in which the yield we get at the outset is the yield we're going to live with. I mean, we'll obviously -- we can obviously get rent escalation over time and increasing yields based on that. But we are not a category where we can go in and accept a dilutive yield going in on the basis of having an underwriting thesis of asset management that's somehow going to magically transform a dilutive yield into an accretive yield. So we are very careful and very humble in understanding what we can and can't do, and that guides our investment decision-making.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just one question on Canyon Ranch and the pref into the operating platform. Is that something that is currently going to make money, either from a cash flow basis or even from an earnings point of view? And then just also how you thought about making an investment into one of your partners operating platform as we think about could that happen going forward and more frequency?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. So I'll take the second part of your question and the first, and then David can answer the first part of your question. In terms of will we be doing a lot more of this? I would say generally, no. I wouldn't rule it out, but I think there's idiosyncrasies, beneficialty of syncrasies to the Canyon Ranch situation, Tony, that gave us high conviction, this was the right thing to do in this situation, investing in the Canyon Ranch operating platform. Insofar as as we look across experiential sectors, we're particularly intrigued with the degree to which wellness is a globally magnificent business in terms of its economics and its scale. As we pointed out in our transaction deck, McKinsey estimates that wellness as manifested in the Canyon Ranch model is a $1.5 trillion global industry. And yet, we think it's one of the least consolidated experiential sectors, especially in relation to its magnitude globally. And so we believe Canyon Ranch has a growth opportunity, a unique growth opportunity that deserved a unique solution in terms of VICI providing growth capital into the operating platform in this particular situation. And then David, do you want to take the first part?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Tony, I mean, it goes to Ed's comments around, it's a holistic solution where we obviously provided the pref and then we'll fund the loan here in the not-too-distant future. But it all goes to the the opportunity that Ed and John talked about on CNBC last night that this was a much greater opportunity than just the pref. The pref itself is accretive to us. It does make money. We funded $90 million yesterday, and we will kind of a delayed draw funding schedule that will happen over the next 3 or 4 quarters. So it's a phenomenal tool to be partners with the organization and grow together.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Evercore.\nUnidentified Analyst: Small technical question. David, what is implicit CPI in your guidance for the balance of the year? What are you assuming on lease escalations, I guess, on a blended basis?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Jim, we just assume the base rates. We don't -- if we had a crystal ball, we would predict CPI, but we don't have a crystal ball. So for [indiscernible] it's 2%, some of the regionals, it's obviously 1.5%, but it's just the base rates in guidance.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. what you do with that. And then perhaps just for John, quickly, you mentioned if you're adding resources. You said to study new verticals. And I mean, could you just elaborate a little further on that? Is that people or new -- what does that mean, I guess? And then what's the cost of that potentially?\nJohn Payne: Yes. We've been adding -- it's a great question. We've been adding -- I think we brought on a new Chief Investment Officer a little over a year ago, and we've been adding staff under David and Aaron's team to get a little deeper in the segments that we've been studying. And it's important to do that. There's only so many places I could be and so many things that a few of us could study. We realized we needed to bring on some resources to be more productive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: As we think about this growth beyond gaming in vehicles that are not the same kind of lease structures you have, right, loans, et cetera. Obviously, the risk profile on those are a bit different, but you're getting paid for that risk. If you could just update us or talk through how you think about that risk and the payment for that risk, it would be helpful.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. So I think when it comes to VICI's credit activities, we do, as you suggested, David, we take great care in the underwriting. I think one of the key elements of our underwriting is that when it comes to absolute bottom line risk, it would be an asset we would be very happy to own if we ended up needing to own it, okay? We don't want to lend against stuff we would never want to own. That for us is absolutely existential. And obviously, we want to make sure we're putting money behind not only a really good asset, but a really good operator in whose credit we can be confident whether they are developing or operating. So in this particular time, I would also say that it is a very accretive deployment of our capital insofar as the overall real estate transaction market continues to be really depressed in terms of activity. I believe the last month that was reported on it was down about 60%, 70% year-over-year. So credit does give us an opportunity to deploy capital accretively in a period in which the transaction market is still somewhat stalled, especially based upon would-be sellers and would-be buyers not having high conviction around what assets -- how assets should be valued.\nJohn Payne: Ed, can I add something to that to David...\nEdward Pitoniak: Sure.\nJohn Payne: Just because we've been talking a lot about nongaming, I think we'll probably continue -- it shouldn't be lost that we continue to travel the world in studying gaming assets. You shouldn't take that -- a lot of the conversation is about these great new partnerships that we've formed in the experiential sectors that somehow we've lost sight of how great the casino business is, we are continuing to do that and and put resources to studying unique opportunities all over the United States and the world.\nOperator: We now turn to Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I just wanted to ask, it looks like the Venetian Palazzo is going to unionize, and I'm just wondering, I know it probably doesn't change your rents, but do you think it meaningfully changes the tenant's coverage ratios as they move to that more structured workforce?\nJohn Payne: Look, it's hard for us to quantitate that. That's probably a question for the operator. But I will remind you, and you know this well, and you've heard me say this many a time, whether the business is up 5%, 10% of the business is down 5%, VICI and its 5.5 years has collected 100% of its rent from all of its operators. So this is an operator decision that the Pallo team made, and I think they feel very good about the workforce there.\nEdward Pitoniak: And Smedes, let me just add, while generally, we do not, for very good reasons, disclose asset level 4-wall rent coverage or EBITDAR, EBITDA before rent, the Venetian did go before the Nevada Gaming Board back in November and did disclose at that time what they expected to achieve for 2022 EBITDAR at the resort and they disclosed they are on track for $650 million of EBITDA before rent. And you know that in our first year, we were collecting $250 million of rent. So there is a lot of coverage at the Venetian.\nSmedes Rose: Yes. Okay. Yes, fair enough. And then you just mentioned that the -- it sounds like there's a little more clarity on the family entertainment and sports area that you're exploring. I mean is that something where you would be -- you would hope to have an announcement in that arena sometime over the course of this year? Or you just -- just wondering if you could just follow up a little bit on those comments.\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, Smedes, I -- clearly, I can't predict when we're going to make announcements. I think it's 2 sectors that were kind of past, a, are we interested in and that we're in the evaluation stage and then how can we structure or be constructive in using our capital to help family entertainment companies or sports category companies grow their business. I really can't tell you exactly when there will be a deal or if there'll be a deal. I just wanted to reiterate that we are digging a little bit deeper in those 2 sectors right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: First question, Ed, your comments in response to a previous question, the company is very focused on AFFO growth and investing on an accretive basis relative to your cost of capital. But how do you weigh asset quality relative to the initial yield and AFFO accretion that an investment may generate? And is there a situation where you could justify making an investment that commands a lower initial yield, but maybe meaningfully improve portfolio quality and it's relatively NAV neutral, but again, may weigh on the company's AFFO growth initially?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. It's a really good question to ask, Todd. And the way we think about it is that we absolutely do recognize the value of quality. And we can find ourselves in situations where we're willing to accept a lower yield on the highest quality real estate. We still want it to be an accretive yield. We can't accept a dilutive yield in the name of quality. But at the end of the day, we are solving for a blended yield across our investment activity. And so if we can buy great real estate at a thinner but still accretive yield, and match that with an investment in good real estate at higher yields and end up with a blended yield that creates real value for our shareholders, that's how we are, and that's how we will run the business.\nTodd Thomas: Okay. And then are you able to -- and apologies if I missed this, but are you able to disclose a little bit of detail around the pricing for the preferred equity investment and the mortgage financing announced with regards to the Canyon Ranch?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Todd, it's David. Good to talk to you. We aren't giving out specific deals similar to how we've kind of operated in the past around the competitive nature of capital out there and the relationship nature of this capital. It's -- as I just talked about, it's all guiding towards a blended yield that's accretive to our cost of capital. So we feel good about the investments.\nEdward Pitoniak: We do. And Todd, this is a great way of elaborating on the first question you asked. I mean we are sitting here in a mansion in the Berkshires. It is the definition of high-quality real estate built to last for generations. And you can be confident that when you put all this together, we are achieving accretion for our shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist.\nCarlo Santarelli: Congrats on the deal with Canyon Ranch. Maybe this is for Ed. But longer term, what would you like to see the mix of rent between gaming and nongaming tenants?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, Barry. I wish we had a really -- well, actually, I don't know if I wish that we had a really exact answer. The truth is we don't have a highly exact answer. It will very much obviously depend on what we're able to source globally in gaming and non-gaming. I do think the math is such that you can be confident gaming will still be the lion's share of our rental given the magnitude of economics that come out of gaming assets domestically and internationally. And we would not put an arbitrary line across our rent roll to say, okay, this much needs to be gaming, this much needs to be nongaming. We're not going to manage in terms of those kinds of numbers, we're going to manage in terms of achieving accretion and value and quality growth.\nBarry Jonas: Understood. And then just as a follow-up, as I guess we think about the pipeline of gaming opportunities, you could kind of put it in 2 buckets or probably more, but for one, there are operators that you've worked with out there and have good relationships and opportunities for follow-up deals. But then there's also a number of large operators who really haven't done much sale leaseback or any. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the path or the catalyst from here to get some of those players over the fence.\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: I mean, we are following the same plans that we have since we started the company is continuing to build relationships, like you said, with our existing operators, and meeting the operators that we've not been fortunate yet to do business with, educating them on how our capital can work, how we can help them grow, once we're partners, how we can use a property growth fund to help them grow, traveling not only domestically as we started the company, but now as you can see, we've been in Canada and acquired some real estate in Canada, and we're traveling the world to find other unique opportunities that are out there. So it's just about building relationships and letting them know that should there be a time they want to monetize their real estate or they want to acquire another company or an asset that we're there to be a good partner.\nOperator: We now turn to Wes Golladay with Baird.\nWesley Golladay: I just want to go back to the Canyon Ranch opportunity. You did mention there's a lot of room for growth, both domestically and internationally. I guess maybe looking at maybe the next 5 to 10 years, how big can this get? And what do you think is an average acquisition volume price? Would $100 million unit be a good estimate?\nEdward Pitoniak: I don't think you'd be far off, Wes. You'd be in the ballpark. There's an optimal size for Canyon Ranches. Generally, I think John Goff and Jeff Kuster and the team would tell you generally between 100 and 150 rooms. And obviously, the room count is only part of the equation. Obviously, the facilities that go around the rooms are what really differentiates Canyon Ranch. But you did hear John Goff on CNBC last night, expressing his ambition that this be a $2 billion relationship in -- within the coming years. And we're very happy to hear him say that. And I do think when you look at this as a $1.5 trillion global industry that McKinsey estimates is going to grow at a compound rate of 5% to 10% a year for the years to come. We do think, again, that the Canyon Ranch brand has growth opportunities not only in North America, but internationally as well. And the other thing I just wanted to say, Wes, is that we -- and it goes back to the question Barry asked -- the second question, Barry asked that John answered. And that is the way in which we initiate partnerships. We don't initiate transactions so much as we initiate partnerships. There's no question that if Canyon Ranch had wanted to sell the real estate to a conventional hotel REIT, they would have gotten amazing pricing, amazingly low cap rates for real estate of this prestige and quality. But the reason we're doing the deal we did is because we took a holistic approach from day 1 at understanding Canyon Ranch's business and its overall capital needs and ended up coming up with solutions that go way beyond your standard real estate transaction.\nWesley Golladay: Got it. And then maybe one for the balance sheet. I did notice you settled some shares and you just carrying the cash balance. What do you thinking there?\nDavid Kieske: No, as we settled 6 million shares, about $190 million to fund the Rocky Gap transaction that closed 2 days ago.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. But you still have like about $700 million, I guess, you want to carry a larger cash balance maybe over the near term?\nDavid Kieske: The cash on specifically, right. That's a result. Remember, we got repaid on the Caesars Forum Convention mortgage back on April 1. So that elevated the cash balance a little bit, but -- so this obviously gives us additional liquidity and dry powder to continue to grow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just quick ones. So all the leverage at the end of the quarter at 5.6 came down nicely. Where does that trend to at the end of the year? And sort of the corollary to that is maybe what's the updated thoughts on the -- who's your park in Horseshoe in Indianapolis? What are some of the things you're looking at to potentially move on that?\nEdward Pitoniak: David will take the first part, Ron, and John will take the second.\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Ron, I appreciate your notice on that. I mean it will continue to trend down to the 5.5 range, maybe just slightly north of that. But as I stated in my remarks, right, we're very focused on getting sub-5.5 and continuing to improve our credit profile.\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: And Ronald, as it pertains to the 2 wonderful assets in Indianapolis, the owner of the assets and the operator Caesars continues to do a fabulous job adding capital to the facilities, implementing the table games that the law passed a couple of years ago and growing that business. We continue to monitor that -- those 2 assets with them. We do have a put call agreement with Caesars that last until the end of December '24, and we continue to evaluate that opportunity.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. My second one is just -- I think with $26 million, $27 million of student loans payments starting. When you talk to the operators and so forth, is that something that they're thinking about as a potential headwind and so forth?\nEdward Pitoniak: Ron -- weyou start, John, and I got an added point I wanted to make.\nJohn Payne: No, go ahead, go ahead, and then I'll jump in.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Ron, it -- Moira and I were talking yesterday or the day before about the magnitude of infrastructure spend that's going on right now in the U.S. Moira, I don't know if you have the figure handy, but there is so much economic growth and so much job growth, really good job growth associated with the magnitude of infrastructure investment that's going on in the U.S. right now that I would definitely look at the impact of student loan repayments being perhaps even more than offset by the economic vitality that's coming out of the infrastructure spending that's going on right now, and especially among the workforce that does have a higher propensity to game. So I think on a net-net basis, we'd be pretty optimistic as to what the economic vitality in the U.S. over the coming year to or more could mean for experiential broadly and gaming in particular. John, I don't know if you want to add to that?\nJohn Payne: No, Ron -- and Ed, I was just going to add about Las Vegas. I mean we continue to get a large percentage of our rent coming out of the operators in the buildings in Las Vegas. Every day, I seem to open up an article and read this morning. I don't know if you saw this, Ronald, but all-time record June at the airport in Las Vegas, 48% growth in international business. So the industry in Las Vegas and the regional continues to see solid consumer acceptance and growth in many of these locations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE.\nJohn DeCree: Maybe big picture, Ed or John, you kind of addressed part of this a little earlier in some of the talent that you've hired recently. But as you push into new verticals and expand your tenant base, new categories, what are some of the challenges that you face or are facing as you grow in this direction. I kind of ask in the context of some of the early day challenges you've had in the casino space with educating investors or even just educating operators into using your source of financing. So curious kind of what you're facing now as you keep pushing.\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, John, nice to talk to you. I actually wouldn't describe them as challenges. I'd describe them as being quite fun, particularly in the experiential sector where there hasn't been a lot of companies like ours, taking the time to explain how our capital can help these experiential companies grow. And it is, for me, having resources and folks around me that we're out again, traveling the world and spending time with these very unique and interesting operators, whether that's in health and fitness, whether that's in the events business or the many of the other things that we continue to explore, it has been really gratifying to explain how our company and our capital and help them grow. So I wouldn't as I describe it as a challenge. I just describe it as a way of we're helping them understand the different ways we can become partners.\nJohn DeCree: Fair enough. And maybe a little easier of a question. Going just back to the Bellagio, potential opportunity as an example. Do you -- how do you consider owning whole or part of an asset? I think there was some discussion to me that maybe it would only be a partial sale or a minority stake. Is that -- would that be a consideration or how that factor into a decision for investment from VICI, whether it's the Bellagio or any asset that you make in the future?\nEdward Pitoniak: Well, John, one of the strategic motivators for doing the deal we did back in late November, early December, was to consolidate what had been a joint venture with MGM Grand Mandalay Bay. So generally speaking, while we do not rule out joint ventures, generally speaking, we are obviously going to prefer complete ownership of our assets, both in gaming and non-gaming. Again, we're not absolutely dogmatic, but it is our preference, and I think there is significance and meaning in the fact that our most recent deal in Las Vegas was the consolidation of what had been a joint venture, not the creation of a new joint venture.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: John, I appreciate your commentary on the fact that you're kind of globetrotting here trying to educate and find new investment opportunities. Are you able to provide any context in terms of maybe with the investable global gaming market is, so meaning like the total number of assets that you'd even be willing to buy globally because I know you've talked specifically about certain countries you're willing to invest in. But just curious in terms of potential investable dollars.\nEdward Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. I don't have the specific numbers right now, Greg. We continue to work on that and look across, as you mentioned, all the different countries where we potentially could place investments. But I don't have a specific number for you right now.\nEdward Pitoniak: Greg, I'll just ask given your representatives of Scotiabank, I'll give you a little Canadian data, and that is that the absolute size is not always as important and meaningful as per cap size. And so as an example, the GGR in Canada, the commercial GGR in Canada is about $12 billion a year, and that compares to combined Las Vegas and regional commercial GGR in the U.S., if I believe, $70 million to $80 million. So on a per capita basis, with Canada having about 1/10 of the population of the U.S., obviously, Canadian show a higher propensity to game. And so that's 1 of the 3 real characteristics we look at as we evaluate gaming globally. It's not only the absolute size of the market, but the propensity of the game and the degree to which gaming is woven into the consumer economy in those countries.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And then I guess just on domestically, what are your thoughts on Downtown Las Vegas? Are owners there just thus far resistant to sale-leaseback financing? Or is there just no need there?\nJohn Payne: I wouldn't say that, Greg. I would say that, as you've heard me say a couple of times on this call, we're continuing to build relationships, we're continuing to educate how our capital can work. I think you're asking about is that a market that we would have interest in owning real estate. There's some fabulous operators in the downtown market of Las Vegas that we are not currently partners with that we'd love to be partners with not only on the assets they have in Downtown Las Vegas, but also is there a way that we could grow with them all over the United States or even the world. We're also not in the regional market of Las Vegas, where we'd like to own real estate over time. So some of these, as you've seen in our first 5 years, some of these happen quickly. Some of these deals move fast and others. It's -- we take the long game here. We get to know the owners. We get to know the operators and hopefully, over time, a deal will come our way.\nGreg McGinniss: And just a final one for me. Just given the house view on the health and wellness sector, should we expect to see investments with other operators outside of Canyon Ranch?\nEdward Pitoniak: I would say that we're very much focused on Canyon Ranch given their market leadership and their growth opportunity, Greg. I mean we obviously wouldn't rule out other investments along the broader wellness spectrum. I mean, in a way, somewhat see that already with -- Great Wolf as I think, John, you've put it. Great Wolf is kind of like Canyon Ranch for kids.\nOperator: We now turn to Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas.\nNathan Crossett: The slide in the deck that showed the CMBS maturities over the next few years, your potential to partner with Canyon Ranch to reposition. How many locations have you kind of identified that are real candidates for this? Have you guys gone through that process already? Just trying to get a sense of the sizing.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. So Nate, we've really just begun that process. But I would point out that for John Goff, he's -- he feels like he's getting to do again what he did so successfully with Richard Rainwater in the early '90s when they built Crescent Real Estate to a great degree out of the whole Resolution Trust wind-up and created an incredibly compelling resort portfolio within Crescent Real Estate by capitalizing on the distress in the market at that time. So we've -- David has done some really good work already at beginning to develop inventories. I would say though that the filtering processes, which we're going to really starts with what regions of North America is Canyon Ranch not in that it could really benefit from being in. And then from there, we look for resorts that would meet the criteria of Canyon Ranch within those geographies, regional geographies.\nNathan Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. And I know you mentioned it's accretive. I just -- what can you say like how accretive? Like is it in line with your average spreads that you've been doing over the cost of capital, historically? I mean I know it's sensitive, but is there any guidance there?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. I mean Nate, good to talk to you. I mean, directionally, that's accurate. Again, it's $150 million. We funded a little bit $90 million this week to draw schedule that will future funding that they will pull down as they invest in the organization. So it's directionally that's in line.\nEdward Pitoniak: And what I will tell you Nate, is that our blended yield for real estate of this quality is very compelling.\nNathan Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. I mean, is there anything other than the $300 million that you disclosed that we should kind of expect in terms of capital deployment from this partnership this year? Like I know there's a lot of puts and takes, but just trying to get a sense of what's in...\nDavid Kieske: And then the last October, we announced the $200 million with Canyon Ranch to help them build Austin. So that's getting going. And as I mentioned in his comments, I opened in '25, '26 at some point. And so mean we had dinner with the Canyon Ranch team last night and they were extremely excited to embark on this journey of mapping and finding these assets. So nothing specific at this moment, but we very much hope there's more to come in the near term.\nOperator: We now turn to Chris Darling with Green Street.\nChris Darling: Related to Canyon Ranch, can you give us a sense of the historic cyclicality of the business there, maybe relative to traditional resorts or maybe the overall hospitality business? And then assuming you do exercise some of the call options there over time, what do you think is the right level of rent coverage relative to maybe your gaming portfolio?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. So Chris, Canyon Ranch has been in operation for just about 45 years. And what they have shown through all cycles is a resilience that is far stronger than conventional luxury resorts. And so much of that has to do with Canyon Ranch being for so much of its clientele a ritual, not even just necessarily an annual ritual but in some cases, a quarterly ritual. So the commitment to Canyon Ranch on the part of the consumer is stronger than the purely discretionary commitment that you get in most luxury resorts, which I know you cover. And so based on that, we do not feel we need inordinately high coverage. And yet what is very comforting is the fact that the economic intensity of these properties does create economic headroom above the rent that gives us very, very great comfort in the level of coverage.\nChris Darling: That's really helpful color. I appreciate it. And then maybe switching gears for a second question. When you announced Rocky Gap last year, rent coverage was pretty skinny at the time. I think it was about 1.7x, if I'm right. I recognize that property has been folded into the broader master lease Century now, but would still be curious to understand what current coverage levels look like, assuming you're willing to share?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, Chris, it's David. Good to talk to you. And we did -- we did set the coverage lower on Rocky Gap because it was going into a very healthy master lease. Century is a phenomenal operator, goes into these assets and improves coverage from where they were, which they did on the 3 pack that we originally bought with them back in 2019. So we can't give out asset level coverage because they don't give out asset level coverage, but it's very, very healthy coverage coming out of those assets, and we're excited to add that as well as the Alberta assets into that master lease.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Dan Guglielmo with Capital One Securities.\nDaniel Guglielmo: Just one for me. Ed, in February, you mentioned that the debt environment back then could result in the greatest advantages to some of the biggest REITs with access to capital. I know a lot has happened since then, but is that advantage playing out the way that you thought? And do you still see that as an advantage continuing for the next few years?\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. I very much think so, Dan. I think that could be true in both gaming and nongaming as I think I might have mentioned on that call, Dan. We look on a weekly basis on what the yields to worst are on on gaming and other leisure credits, and you're still seeing yields to worse even with the recent tightening of spreads that make sale leasebacks a very compelling alternative when it comes to refinancing the debt that will come due in the coming years in both gaming and non-gaming.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A. I will now hand back to Ed Pitoniak, CEO, for closing remarks.\nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. I just want to thank everybody on the call today, both the analysts who asked very good questions in all of our investors who are also on the line. We thank you for your time, and we're excited to talk to you again in a few months. Bye for now.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Edward Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to talk this morning about our Q2 2023 results featuring a year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 11.9%, which we believe will be among the higher growth rates for S&P 500 REITs for Q2 2023, and yet at one of the lowest price to earnings growth ratios, PEG or PEG plus yield ratios among the S&P 500 REITs. For the course of the call, John will share with you what we're doing strategically to continue our growth, and David will give you details on our liquidity position, our Q2 2023 results and our updated earnings outlook to year-end.  I will now spend a few minutes on the exciting news we shared last night with the announcement of our significantly expanded growth partnership with Canyon Ranch, a legendary and leading brand in the place-based wellness sector. Indeed, I'm excited to say that the VICI team is conducting this call from Canyon Ranch Lennox in the beautiful Berkshires in Massachusetts. The key elements of our expanded Canyon Ranch partnership are BG making an up to $150 million preferred equity investment in the Canyon Ranch operating company to support the expansion of the Canyon Ranch operating and digital platforms as well as enhancements to the Tucson and Lenox assets. VICI also intends to provide approximately $150 million of mortgage financing secured by Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox to refinance Canyon Ranch's existing CMBS debt. With this refinancing serving as a bridge to enhancing VICI's embedded growth pipeline by specifically allowing for VICI's conversion of its existing purchase options on Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox, which are converting to call rights, whereby VICI can elect to acquire the real estate assets of Canyon Ranch Tucson and Canyon Ranch Lenox in the coming years, subject to certain conditions, with Canyon Ranch continuing to operate the assets under long-term triple net leases. This also includes VICI's previously announced commitment to provide up to $200 million of development funding for Canyon Ranch Austin, which is scheduled to open between 2025 and 2026 with a call right to own the real estate upon stabilization. And finally, the joint development of a strategy of identifying and potentially acquiring conventional resorts that have conversion potential to new Canyon Ranch resorts with Canyon Ranch operating the resorts and VICI owning the resort real estate under a long-term triple net lease.  Canyon Ranch has nearly 45 years of operating history. It serves a highly affluent clientele that invest vigorously through all cycles in medical and holistic life enhancement experiences and services. With only 2 established destination resort locations, we believe Canyon Ranch is positioned to significantly expand its clientele and its geography domestically and internationally. We are investing in Canyon Ranch to help fund and energize that expansion gaining through our partnership the opportunity to fund the acquisition and integration of new Canyon Ranch Resorts. Under the leadership of CEO, Jeff Kuster, the Canyon Ranch team is poised to grow its brand reach and network breadth, both programmatically and geographically. And of all the elements of our expanded partnership with Canyon Ranch, John Goff, Canyon Ranch's [indiscernible] and I are most excited about network expansion in the years ahead. Both John Goff and I believe that the conventional resort sector could see elements of distress in the next few years, less to do with operating performance and more to do with refinancing constriction.  As we have pointed out in our transaction deck, which can be found at www.viciproperties.com, more than $37 billion of resort and hotel CMBS financing will come due from 2024 through 2028. And I should point out that, that's only a fraction of the overall mortgage financing on U.S. hotels and resorts during this period. We believe that within those billions of dollars, our resorts that could meet Canon Ranch's conversion criteria.  The conversion of a conventional resort to a Canyon Ranch Resort has the potential to be transformative thanks to the capital and operating dynamics of the Canyon Ranch economic model. The Canyon Ranch model centers on maximizing the guest experience of space, indoors and out, and maximizing the guest experience of time through Canyon Ranch's holistic wellness and life enhancement offerings. This maximization of experiences leads to a revenue intensity within the Canyon Ranch model that surpasses the economic intensity of a conventional resort, potentially giving Canyon Ranch and VICI competitive advantage in acquiring and realizing value out of resort locations meeting our criteria. I believe our growth opportunity with Canyon Ranch is a generational opportunity in multiple senses of generational. Wellness is a secular growth trend that is multigenerational in its consumer profile and generational in terms of its secular outlook and growth opportunity. And Canyon Ranch Resorts are real estate built to last for generations.  At VICI, we invest in partnerships and real estate assets that will preserve and grow value for many generations to come. As you look across the spectrum of S&P 500 REITs, ask yourself is the real estate of high-quality and generational durability? And does the real estate enjoy the benefit of cultural and demographic tailwinds that will sustain and grow the value of the real estate for generations come? With VICI, I believe you get high-quality enduring real estate occupied by operators serving multiple generations of customers for generations to come. We believe our expanded partnership with Canyon Ranch is a superb example of this value proposition.  With that, over to you, John Payne. Yes. Tony, I'll start and John and David can chime in as they wish. I want to answer that question at the level of general principles. We take great care in how we acquire and that care manifests itself in us not attempting to buy what we can accretively pay for. And so we evaluate every situation on the basis of can we create value for our investors straight out of the gate. Our net lease model is a model in which the yield we get at the outset is the yield we're going to live with. I mean, we'll obviously -- we can obviously get rent escalation over time and increasing yields based on that. But we are not a category where we can go in and accept a dilutive yield going in on the basis of having an underwriting thesis of asset management that's somehow going to magically transform a dilutive yield into an accretive yield. So we are very careful and very humble in understanding what we can and can't do, and that guides our investment decision-making. Yes. So I'll take the second part of your question and the first, and then David can answer the first part of your question. In terms of will we be doing a lot more of this? I would say generally, no. I wouldn't rule it out, but I think there's idiosyncrasies, beneficialty of syncrasies to the Canyon Ranch situation, Tony, that gave us high conviction, this was the right thing to do in this situation, investing in the Canyon Ranch operating platform. Insofar as as we look across experiential sectors, we're particularly intrigued with the degree to which wellness is a globally magnificent business in terms of its economics and its scale. As we pointed out in our transaction deck, McKinsey estimates that wellness as manifested in the Canyon Ranch model is a $1.5 trillion global industry. And yet, we think it's one of the least consolidated experiential sectors, especially in relation to its magnitude globally. And so we believe Canyon Ranch has a growth opportunity, a unique growth opportunity that deserved a unique solution in terms of VICI providing growth capital into the operating platform in this particular situation. And then David, do you want to take the first part? Yes. So I think when it comes to VICI's credit activities, we do, as you suggested, David, we take great care in the underwriting. I think one of the key elements of our underwriting is that when it comes to absolute bottom line risk, it would be an asset we would be very happy to own if we ended up needing to own it, okay? We don't want to lend against stuff we would never want to own. That for us is absolutely existential. And obviously, we want to make sure we're putting money behind not only a really good asset, but a really good operator in whose credit we can be confident whether they are developing or operating. So in this particular time, I would also say that it is a very accretive deployment of our capital insofar as the overall real estate transaction market continues to be really depressed in terms of activity. I believe the last month that was reported on it was down about 60%, 70% year-over-year. So credit does give us an opportunity to deploy capital accretively in a period in which the transaction market is still somewhat stalled, especially based upon would-be sellers and would-be buyers not having high conviction around what assets -- how assets should be valued. Sure. And Smedes, let me just add, while generally, we do not, for very good reasons, disclose asset level 4-wall rent coverage or EBITDAR, EBITDA before rent, the Venetian did go before the Nevada Gaming Board back in November and did disclose at that time what they expected to achieve for 2022 EBITDAR at the resort and they disclosed they are on track for $650 million of EBITDA before rent. And you know that in our first year, we were collecting $250 million of rent. So there is a lot of coverage at the Venetian. John? Yes. It's a really good question to ask, Todd. And the way we think about it is that we absolutely do recognize the value of quality. And we can find ourselves in situations where we're willing to accept a lower yield on the highest quality real estate. We still want it to be an accretive yield. We can't accept a dilutive yield in the name of quality. But at the end of the day, we are solving for a blended yield across our investment activity. And so if we can buy great real estate at a thinner but still accretive yield, and match that with an investment in good real estate at higher yields and end up with a blended yield that creates real value for our shareholders, that's how we are, and that's how we will run the business. We do. And Todd, this is a great way of elaborating on the first question you asked. I mean we are sitting here in a mansion in the Berkshires. It is the definition of high-quality real estate built to last for generations. And you can be confident that when you put all this together, we are achieving accretion for our shareholders. Yes, Barry. I wish we had a really -- well, actually, I don't know if I wish that we had a really exact answer. The truth is we don't have a highly exact answer. It will very much obviously depend on what we're able to source globally in gaming and non-gaming. I do think the math is such that you can be confident gaming will still be the lion's share of our rental given the magnitude of economics that come out of gaming assets domestically and internationally. And we would not put an arbitrary line across our rent roll to say, okay, this much needs to be gaming, this much needs to be nongaming. We're not going to manage in terms of those kinds of numbers, we're going to manage in terms of achieving accretion and value and quality growth. John? I don't think you'd be far off, Wes. You'd be in the ballpark. There's an optimal size for Canyon Ranches. Generally, I think John Goff and Jeff Kuster and the team would tell you generally between 100 and 150 rooms. And obviously, the room count is only part of the equation. Obviously, the facilities that go around the rooms are what really differentiates Canyon Ranch. But you did hear John Goff on CNBC last night, expressing his ambition that this be a $2 billion relationship in -- within the coming years. And we're very happy to hear him say that. And I do think when you look at this as a $1.5 trillion global industry that McKinsey estimates is going to grow at a compound rate of 5% to 10% a year for the years to come. We do think, again, that the Canyon Ranch brand has growth opportunities not only in North America, but internationally as well. And the other thing I just wanted to say, Wes, is that we -- and it goes back to the question Barry asked -- the second question, Barry asked that John answered. And that is the way in which we initiate partnerships. We don't initiate transactions so much as we initiate partnerships. There's no question that if Canyon Ranch had wanted to sell the real estate to a conventional hotel REIT, they would have gotten amazing pricing, amazingly low cap rates for real estate of this prestige and quality. But the reason we're doing the deal we did is because we took a holistic approach from day 1 at understanding Canyon Ranch's business and its overall capital needs and ended up coming up with solutions that go way beyond your standard real estate transaction. David will take the first part, Ron, and John will take the second. John? Ron -- weyou start, John, and I got an added point I wanted to make. Yes. Ron, it -- Moira and I were talking yesterday or the day before about the magnitude of infrastructure spend that's going on right now in the U.S. Moira, I don't know if you have the figure handy, but there is so much economic growth and so much job growth, really good job growth associated with the magnitude of infrastructure investment that's going on in the U.S. right now that I would definitely look at the impact of student loan repayments being perhaps even more than offset by the economic vitality that's coming out of the infrastructure spending that's going on right now, and especially among the workforce that does have a higher propensity to game. So I think on a net-net basis, we'd be pretty optimistic as to what the economic vitality in the U.S. over the coming year to or more could mean for experiential broadly and gaming in particular. John, I don't know if you want to add to that? John? Well, John, one of the strategic motivators for doing the deal we did back in late November, early December, was to consolidate what had been a joint venture with MGM Grand Mandalay Bay. So generally speaking, while we do not rule out joint ventures, generally speaking, we are obviously going to prefer complete ownership of our assets, both in gaming and non-gaming. Again, we're not absolutely dogmatic, but it is our preference, and I think there is significance and meaning in the fact that our most recent deal in Las Vegas was the consolidation of what had been a joint venture, not the creation of a new joint venture. John? Greg, I'll just ask given your representatives of Scotiabank, I'll give you a little Canadian data, and that is that the absolute size is not always as important and meaningful as per cap size. And so as an example, the GGR in Canada, the commercial GGR in Canada is about $12 billion a year, and that compares to combined Las Vegas and regional commercial GGR in the U.S., if I believe, $70 million to $80 million. So on a per capita basis, with Canada having about 1/10 of the population of the U.S., obviously, Canadian show a higher propensity to game. And so that's 1 of the 3 real characteristics we look at as we evaluate gaming globally. It's not only the absolute size of the market, but the propensity of the game and the degree to which gaming is woven into the consumer economy in those countries. I would say that we're very much focused on Canyon Ranch given their market leadership and their growth opportunity, Greg. I mean we obviously wouldn't rule out other investments along the broader wellness spectrum. I mean, in a way, somewhat see that already with -- Great Wolf as I think, John, you've put it. Great Wolf is kind of like Canyon Ranch for kids. Yes. So Nate, we've really just begun that process. But I would point out that for John Goff, he's -- he feels like he's getting to do again what he did so successfully with Richard Rainwater in the early '90s when they built Crescent Real Estate to a great degree out of the whole Resolution Trust wind-up and created an incredibly compelling resort portfolio within Crescent Real Estate by capitalizing on the distress in the market at that time. So we've -- David has done some really good work already at beginning to develop inventories. I would say though that the filtering processes, which we're going to really starts with what regions of North America is Canyon Ranch not in that it could really benefit from being in. And then from there, we look for resorts that would meet the criteria of Canyon Ranch within those geographies, regional geographies. And what I will tell you Nate, is that our blended yield for real estate of this quality is very compelling. Yes. So Chris, Canyon Ranch has been in operation for just about 45 years. And what they have shown through all cycles is a resilience that is far stronger than conventional luxury resorts. And so much of that has to do with Canyon Ranch being for so much of its clientele a ritual, not even just necessarily an annual ritual but in some cases, a quarterly ritual. So the commitment to Canyon Ranch on the part of the consumer is stronger than the purely discretionary commitment that you get in most luxury resorts, which I know you cover. And so based on that, we do not feel we need inordinately high coverage. And yet what is very comforting is the fact that the economic intensity of these properties does create economic headroom above the rent that gives us very, very great comfort in the level of coverage. Yes. I very much think so, Dan. I think that could be true in both gaming and nongaming as I think I might have mentioned on that call, Dan. We look on a weekly basis on what the yields to worst are on on gaming and other leisure credits, and you're still seeing yields to worse even with the recent tightening of spreads that make sale leasebacks a very compelling alternative when it comes to refinancing the debt that will come due in the coming years in both gaming and non-gaming. Yes. I just want to thank everybody on the call today, both the analysts who asked very good questions in all of our investors who are also on the line. We thank you for your time, and we're excited to talk to you again in a few months. Bye for now."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. Ed makes an excellent point on the quality enduring aspects of VICI's portfolio. Our tenants continue to prove their operational excellence and their ability to innovate and evolve their business. And importantly, for VICI, their assets as well. The results that continue to come out of Las Vegas speak to our tenants' operational quality and the operating credit, which we believe accrues to the value of our real estate. I will touch on Las Vegas in the gaming sector shortly. But I wanted to emphasize the type of portfolio we have built and that the team continues to build at VICI. These characteristics are a core focus of our strategy as we meet potential partners in gaming and nongaming experiential sectors, both domestically and internationally.  To recap our second quarter and subsequent activity, VICI continued its international expansion into Canada with our announcement of the acquisition of 4 gaming assets from Century Casino in Alberta. We also closed on the acquisition of the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Maryland this week, again with Century Casinos. Our partnership with Century is a great example of the type of operators we look for as the relationship is a win-win for both businesses as we grow together. Canyon Ranch also exemplifies the type of growth-minded partner with operational excellence and place-based wellness. As as described earlier, we are very excited to deepen and expand the relationship into the future.  Growing with our partners as they look to enhance and expand their businesses is a core component of our strategy as we develop and deepen our relationships across gaming and the non-gaming sectors. This approach helps VICI continue to grow a more visible pipeline into our future with operators we value and we trust. It also allows VICI to build a portfolio of assets with each partner that we believe can meaningfully impact VICI's growth over time. In the gaming sector, we continue to be impressed by our tenants. They exemplify the operational excellence we seek to find as we expand into other sectors. In what other sector right now, can you find a headline that reads \"Another all-time record result, but in line with consensus.\" Las Vegas has remained at or near all-time highs in terms of margins and results and is continuing to see record traffic. Regional casinos are performing well as the high-value consumer segment remains quite healthy. We continue to see many domestic real estate opportunities in gaming, including in markets where we do not currently own assets and as the industry expands its footprint into new areas of the United States. We also remain focused on international opportunities with the team traveling the globe this year, meeting new potential partners. As VICI's brand has ascended the funnel of opportunities has expanded in both gaming and non-gaming. We've added resources to meet the expanded funnel of opportunities. And as always, we work closely with our advisers and those in the VICI network to help force multiply our ability to create and evaluate opportunities.  For nongaming, we are intensely studying various sectors at a category level and operating level and at an asset level. Notably, in the family entertainment and sports categories, we're moving past the evaluation stage and into constructive discussions on how VICI's capital can fit best with our growing relationships. As you know, our relationships at VICI are at the heart of our success, and they take time to cultivate as we aim to find the best solutions that meet the goals of both sides, especially in an ever-evolving economic and capital markets environment. We're excited about how these relationships are developing.  The VICI team has been hard at work this year, building relationships and opportunities for a pipeline of growth across multiple sectors and geographies in the years to come. We are focused on partnering with best-in-class growth-minded operators with whom VICI can continue to grow our high-quality and generational real estate portfolio. We worked tirelessly to deliver results to our shareholders, evidenced by the last 5.5 years.  Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David? Yes. We've been adding -- it's a great question. We've been adding -- I think we brought on a new Chief Investment Officer a little over a year ago, and we've been adding staff under David and Aaron's team to get a little deeper in the segments that we've been studying. And it's important to do that. There's only so many places I could be and so many things that a few of us could study. We realized we needed to bring on some resources to be more productive. Ed, can I add something to that to David... Just because we've been talking a lot about nongaming, I think we'll probably continue -- it shouldn't be lost that we continue to travel the world in studying gaming assets. You shouldn't take that -- a lot of the conversation is about these great new partnerships that we've formed in the experiential sectors that somehow we've lost sight of how great the casino business is, we are continuing to do that and and put resources to studying unique opportunities all over the United States and the world. Look, it's hard for us to quantitate that. That's probably a question for the operator. But I will remind you, and you know this well, and you've heard me say this many a time, whether the business is up 5%, 10% of the business is down 5%, VICI and its 5.5 years has collected 100% of its rent from all of its operators. So this is an operator decision that the Pallo team made, and I think they feel very good about the workforce there. Yes, Smedes, I -- clearly, I can't predict when we're going to make announcements. I think it's 2 sectors that were kind of past, a, are we interested in and that we're in the evaluation stage and then how can we structure or be constructive in using our capital to help family entertainment companies or sports category companies grow their business. I really can't tell you exactly when there will be a deal or if there'll be a deal. I just wanted to reiterate that we are digging a little bit deeper in those 2 sectors right now. I mean, we are following the same plans that we have since we started the company is continuing to build relationships, like you said, with our existing operators, and meeting the operators that we've not been fortunate yet to do business with, educating them on how our capital can work, how we can help them grow, once we're partners, how we can use a property growth fund to help them grow, traveling not only domestically as we started the company, but now as you can see, we've been in Canada and acquired some real estate in Canada, and we're traveling the world to find other unique opportunities that are out there. So it's just about building relationships and letting them know that should there be a time they want to monetize their real estate or they want to acquire another company or an asset that we're there to be a good partner. And Ronald, as it pertains to the 2 wonderful assets in Indianapolis, the owner of the assets and the operator Caesars continues to do a fabulous job adding capital to the facilities, implementing the table games that the law passed a couple of years ago and growing that business. We continue to monitor that -- those 2 assets with them. We do have a put call agreement with Caesars that last until the end of December '24, and we continue to evaluate that opportunity. No, go ahead, go ahead, and then I'll jump in. No, Ron -- and Ed, I was just going to add about Las Vegas. I mean we continue to get a large percentage of our rent coming out of the operators in the buildings in Las Vegas. Every day, I seem to open up an article and read this morning. I don't know if you saw this, Ronald, but all-time record June at the airport in Las Vegas, 48% growth in international business. So the industry in Las Vegas and the regional continues to see solid consumer acceptance and growth in many of these locations. Yes, John, nice to talk to you. I actually wouldn't describe them as challenges. I'd describe them as being quite fun, particularly in the experiential sector where there hasn't been a lot of companies like ours, taking the time to explain how our capital can help these experiential companies grow. And it is, for me, having resources and folks around me that we're out again, traveling the world and spending time with these very unique and interesting operators, whether that's in health and fitness, whether that's in the events business or the many of the other things that we continue to explore, it has been really gratifying to explain how our company and our capital and help them grow. So I wouldn't as I describe it as a challenge. I just describe it as a way of we're helping them understand the different ways we can become partners. Yes. I don't have the specific numbers right now, Greg. We continue to work on that and look across, as you mentioned, all the different countries where we potentially could place investments. But I don't have a specific number for you right now. I wouldn't say that, Greg. I would say that, as you've heard me say a couple of times on this call, we're continuing to build relationships, we're continuing to educate how our capital can work. I think you're asking about is that a market that we would have interest in owning real estate. There's some fabulous operators in the downtown market of Las Vegas that we are not currently partners with that we'd love to be partners with not only on the assets they have in Downtown Las Vegas, but also is there a way that we could grow with them all over the United States or even the world. We're also not in the regional market of Las Vegas, where we'd like to own real estate over time. So some of these, as you've seen in our first 5 years, some of these happen quickly. Some of these deals move fast and others. It's -- we take the long game here. We get to know the owners. We get to know the operators and hopefully, over time, a deal will come our way."

            "content": "Thanks, John. I'll keep my remarks brief as we want to leave as much time for everyone's questions, but I do want to touch on our liquidity and our updated full year guidance. We are constantly focusing and at times obsessing on the balance sheet as we work to bring our leverage back down to our target range of 5 to 5.5x, while ensuring we have the dry powder to continue to fund accretive growth for our shareholders. We are diligently working with the agencies to improve our credit ratings over time, lower our cost of capital while balancing the right leverage for the company.  At quarter end, we had approximately $4 billion in total liquidity, comprised of approximately $740 million in cash, $870 million of net proceeds available under our forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we settled approximately $190 million in shares under our forward sale agreements to fund the closing of Rocky Gap.  In terms of leverage, net debt to annualized Q2 adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.6x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.4 years to maturity.  Turning to the income statement. AFFO per share was $0.54 for the quarter, an increase of nearly 12% compared to $0.48 for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.  Turning to guidance. We are updating AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is now expected to be between $2.13 billion and $2.16 billion or between $2.11 and $2.14 per diluted common share. Just to reiterate, based on the midpoint of our updated guidance, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 10%, one of the highest growth rates across REIT brands.  And as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. And as we've discussed with you in the past, we reported noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused and -- as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the product -- productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Tony, I mean, it goes to Ed's comments around, it's a holistic solution where we obviously provided the pref and then we'll fund the loan here in the not-too-distant future. But it all goes to the the opportunity that Ed and John talked about on CNBC last night that this was a much greater opportunity than just the pref. The pref itself is accretive to us. It does make money. We funded $90 million yesterday, and we will kind of a delayed draw funding schedule that will happen over the next 3 or 4 quarters. So it's a phenomenal tool to be partners with the organization and grow together. Yes, Jim, we just assume the base rates. We don't -- if we had a crystal ball, we would predict CPI, but we don't have a crystal ball. So for [indiscernible] it's 2%, some of the regionals, it's obviously 1.5%, but it's just the base rates in guidance. Yes, Todd, it's David. Good to talk to you. We aren't giving out specific deals similar to how we've kind of operated in the past around the competitive nature of capital out there and the relationship nature of this capital. It's -- as I just talked about, it's all guiding towards a blended yield that's accretive to our cost of capital. So we feel good about the investments. No, as we settled 6 million shares, about $190 million to fund the Rocky Gap transaction that closed 2 days ago. The cash on specifically, right. That's a result. Remember, we got repaid on the Caesars Forum Convention mortgage back on April 1. So that elevated the cash balance a little bit, but -- so this obviously gives us additional liquidity and dry powder to continue to grow. Yes, Ron, I appreciate your notice on that. I mean it will continue to trend down to the 5.5 range, maybe just slightly north of that. But as I stated in my remarks, right, we're very focused on getting sub-5.5 and continuing to improve our credit profile. Yes. I mean Nate, good to talk to you. I mean, directionally, that's accurate. Again, it's $150 million. We funded a little bit $90 million this week to draw schedule that will future funding that they will pull down as they invest in the organization. So it's directionally that's in line. And then the last October, we announced the $200 million with Canyon Ranch to help them build Austin. So that's getting going. And as I mentioned in his comments, I opened in '25, '26 at some point. And so mean we had dinner with the Canyon Ranch team last night and they were extremely excited to embark on this journey of mapping and finding these assets. So nothing specific at this moment, but we very much hope there's more to come in the near term. Yes, Chris, it's David. Good to talk to you. And we did -- we did set the coverage lower on Rocky Gap because it was going into a very healthy master lease. Century is a phenomenal operator, goes into these assets and improves coverage from where they were, which they did on the 3 pack that we originally bought with them back in 2019. So we can't give out asset level coverage because they don't give out asset level coverage, but it's very, very healthy coverage coming out of those assets, and we're excited to add that as well as the Alberta assets into that master lease."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, May 2, 2023.  I'll now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's first quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are which are usually identified by use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, projects or other similar phrases, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions.  During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website and our first quarter 2023 earnings release, our supplemental information and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Moira McCloskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we will open the call to questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today by telling you how I tend to spend my Saturday mornings espresso in hand. First, I grab the FT, the old-fashioned print edition, to see what Katie Martin has to say about the state of the equity and credit markets in her Long View column. Katie can be very funny. But the long and short of it is that the market participants she's quoting these days aren't having a lot of fun. Then I might grab my iPad and catch up on any of Rob Armstrong's unhedged FT columns that I fell behind on during the prior week. Rob's response to current and prospective market conditions is rather Hamlet in character: to be or not to be, to be a bull or to be a bear or to be neither. But who is he who is neither bull nor bear? That is the question. In my second espresso, I might see with the two Michaels and one Marko, among others, have had to offer a market commentary and forecasting in the prior few days, Hartnett, Wilson, Kolanovic. I could call them the 3 archdukes of doom, but that would be unfair. Well, actually not that unfair. And these folks are formulating a rational response to the current state of the macro economy, monetary and fiscal policy and the markets. Visibility is low. Uncertainty is high. In commercial real estate, asset pricing is murky and/or subject to dispute between would be sellers and would be buyers. As a result, there's not a whole lot of trading going on. Commercial real estate trading was down nearly 70% year-over-year in March 2023. And it's not like March 2022 was a barn burner for real estate assets or portfolio trading. What does all this uncertainty and low visibility mean for how we're thinking and what we're doing at VICI? Our thinking in doing starts with our current state of earnings growth and investment activity. As you saw on last night's VICI earnings release, for Q1 2023, we generated year-over-year AFFO growth of 18.6% per share, a rate that we believe will be among the highest for REITs generally and S&P 500 REITs specifically. And to take a broader view, so far in earnings season, year-over-year Q1 2023 earnings growth for S&P 500 companies of all kinds is running at negative 4% versus VICI's Q1 AFFO growth again at 18.6%. But it's not only about growth in current earnings, it's about growing our future earnings. Along that line and even amidst this murky trading environment, within Q1, we allocated a total of $1.6 billion of incremental capital to compelling and accretive experiential property and lending investments, which John will have more detail on in a moment. And even with that $1.6 billion of capital having been newly allocated in Q1, we have approximately $859 million of equity dry powder, thanks to our unsettled forward equity and approximately $650 million in cash. Combined that with $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, and we have the funding in place to seize on further opportunity if opportunity presents itself in this current environment. Most of all, during an uncertain time like this, we keep doing what we've done at VICI from the beginning. We are always working on our future, growing relationships that have the potential to grow our business. These relationships don't have to turn into deals tomorrow, as John has noted in the past. In that vein, think about the fact that the AFFO growth VICI expects to produce in 2023 is in good measure, the result of relationship building we did many years ago with those who would end up being our partners in our Venetian and MGP transaction, which we announced in 2021. Thus, it is, to reiterate, that much of the work we are doing at VICI in 2023 is about growth in 2024, 2025 and beyond. And yet I don't mean to suggest that we are not jumping on immediate opportunities when those opportunities are compelling, as evidenced again by the $1.6 billion of capital we newly deployed in Q1 2023. Finally, we are working intensely in the present and for our future with one of the lowest G&A loads in American triple net REIT management as a percentage of revenues or of assets. Think of our G&A as a form of asset management fee. Our asset management fee understood in this way, as measured by VICI corporate G&A, runs at about 0.1% of assets under management. That's a fee load you would expect from a passive manager of an index fund. With VICI for 0.1%, you get very active investment management that has historically produced significant outperformance. I'll now turn the call to John so that he can share with you what kind of activities we have been up to and are up to. John?\nJohn Payne : Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. Ed quoted Shakespeare's Hamlet when describing current market conditions. So I thought it would be appropriate to quote another great, Ted Lasso, when describing how the VICI team has functioned through the last 5 years of a rather volatile market. Coach Lasso said, \"The harder you work, the luckier you get.\" We saw the results of that work come together in 2022, which was a transformational year for VICI in which we doubled our size and scale, becoming one of the largest triple net REITs. 2023, as Ed just noted, is the year in which we are laying the groundwork for VICI's next phase of expansion domestically and globally across gaming and many other experiential sectors. In the first quarter, VICI closed on its first international transaction with PURE Canadian Gaming in Alberta, Canada, one of Canada's top gaming markets. We are thrilled that our first international transaction was in Canada as we believe the Canadian gaming industry presents a great opportunity for VICI as it is an established industry with many similarities to the U.S. gaming industry. This transaction will be the first of many international investments that the VICI team continues to explore across the globe. We also completed the acquisition of the remaining 49.9% stake in our Mandalay Bay/MGM Grand joint venture with Blackstone. This real estate consolidation was a great example of our high functioning partnership with Blackstone as we both accomplished important goals with this transaction, and VICI now owns 100% of 2 additional Class A resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. To spend a moment on Las Vegas. In February, over 4 million people traveled through Harry Reid Airport for the first time ever, which is 25% above February of 2022. Our operating partners continue to set all-time records and volumes in all segments continue to remain strong. Our operating partners continue to see very strong hotel occupancy and are also experiencing a nice recovery in the group and convention business. These strong operating numbers are the result of tremendous innovation and capital deployment by our tenants and their work is making Las Vegas the gaming, sports and entertainment capital of the world. We're also proud to expand our relationship with tribal nations, adding Cherokee Nation businesses of Oklahoma to our tenant roster as they enter into the lease agreement related to the Gold Strike Casino and Resort in Tunica, Mississippi. We are also supporting our partners at Hard Rock in the redevelopment of Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada by purchasing a portion of the senior secured notes funding this exciting new project. The American tribal nations are some of the best gaming operators, and we look forward to continue to find ways to help support their growth as they expand in the commercial gaming across the country. Within nongaming experiential industries, the team is intensely studying sectors we believe fit well with our VICI Properties investment criteria. We continue to meet and build relationship with owners and operators in many sectors, including health and wellness, youth, collegiate and professional sports, various forms of family entertainment, theme parks, holiday parks and other destination-based experiences. The team is forging foundational relationships with the market leaders who have ambitions to grow and see VICI as a preferred capital partner for their businesses, similar to those we helped, Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch. For this quarter, we expanded our indoor water park presence with our fourth loan to Great Wolf Lodge to fund the development of their location in Connecticut and in partnership with the Foxwoods Resort. The VICI team will make the most of this year by continuing to build a pipeline of partnerships that we believe will help us achieve our future growth goals, while at the same time expecting to deliver at least 10% of AFFO per share growth in 2023. As you've observed over the past 5 years, our team does not rest very often as we're laser-focused on building the highest quality experiential REIT in the world. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?\nDavid Kieske : Thanks, John. 2023 started off with several very exciting transactions. Our ability to move quickly and close these acquisitions at the start of the year as a result of the liquidity we have maintained and balance sheet that we have built over the years in an effort to be nimble and act on attractive opportunities as they come before us. We will continue to focus on the balance sheet as it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. As John mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the four PURE Canadian gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, the 49.9% interest we previously did not own in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. And we purchased $85 million of senior secured notes issued by Hard Rock Ottawa LP. This is an exciting transaction for VICI as we partnered with a large financial institution to provide Hard Rock with a complete financing solution for the redevelopment of what will become the Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada. In addition, we announced a $287.9 million construction loan for the development of a Great Wolf Lodge, which sits on land owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation next to the Foxwoods Resort Casino. This transaction represents our fourth loan with Great Wolf for a total capital commitment of approximately $550 million to support Great Wolf's development pipeline. In January, we re-bolstered our liquidity raising approximately $965 million of available net equity proceeds through the sale of 30.3 million shares via forward sale agreements. On April 4, we physically settled 3.2 million of these shares for net proceeds of approximately $101.5 million. As we sit here today, we have approximately $3.9 billion in total liquidity, As Ed mentioned, this is comprised of approximately $650 million in cash, $859 million of net proceeds available from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In terms of the leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of CMBS debt that encumbers the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x today. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity. Turning to the income statement. AFFO was $528.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 73% over Q1 2022. AFFO per share was $0.53 for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% compared to the $0.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. As a reminder, the disparity between our overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from equity raise and shares issued to fund our acquisition of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay JV this quarter and to consummate our acquisitions of MGP during Q2 and the Venetian Resort during Q1 of last year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. As a reminder, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability, leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Elliott, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone : My first question relates to your discussion around building relationships for the future pipeline. And so I was wondering if you can comment on whether or not there's a certain type of deal size that's emerging as a sweet spot for the different things you're looking at or even a region perhaps in the world where sort of the deal flow seems to be pointing.\nEdward Pitoniak : [Indiscernible]\nJohn Payne : Do you want me to take that?\nEdward Pitoniak : Well, John, I just want to -- what? Sorry, can you hear me now? If not, go ahead, John.\nJohn Payne : We can hear you, Ed.\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes, I was just going to say, Tony, I apologize for that. When we work on relationships, we're obviously working on new ones all the time. But we also work very hard make sure our existing relationships are strong and productive, mutually productive as they can be. And thus, we were rather honored that Jonathan Halkyard, the CFO at MGM, referenced in his earnings call last night to VICI being a fantastic partner of ours. So that's a very big focus in terms of where future growth can come from, which is to say with our existing tenants. But in terms of the other relationships we're building, I'll turn it over to John. John?\nJohn Payne : Yes. Tony, I won't go into specifics about the relationships we're building. We are studying the industry, countries around the world. But I just use -- we've been asked since we started the company about when we look at something that's the size and how small. I mean, I'll just use the example of a Century gaming, we did one deal. We then announced the deal in Maryland with them. And we're just -- hopefully, over time, we'll continue to build that relationship. So we really think that there are times that a smaller deal by itself may \"look small,\" but over the lifetime of a partnership or a relationship, that will get larger. And so we are chalking up miles, meeting folks face to face and traveling the world to find opportunities for our company and for our shareholders that are accretive.\nAnthony Paolone : Okay. And John, just as a follow-up maybe. Capital markets have been volatile over the last few months or quarters. Like can you maybe give us a sense as to what the brackets are on yields for the things you're considering right now?\nJohn Payne : Well, that would have been an easier question back 5 years ago, I think, Tony, when we were just looking at gaming opportunities domestically. We could probably take the rest of the call as we look at different sectors. But I'll let David talk about how thoughtful we are in understanding our cost of capital and getting spreads when we're making investments or creating term sheets. But we're looking at a wide variety of sectors, countries in gaming and non-gaming. So David, do you want to touch a little bit on that as well?\nDavid Kieske : Yes, happy to, John. And Tony, good to talk to yet. I mean, as you saw during the quarter, we partnered with a large financial institution and put out some capital at an 11% rate. I'm not here to say that every deal we're going to do is going to be 11%. But we are focused on a blended spread to our cost of capital, and we've -- our share price has held in our financing costs, just to get ahead of that question, is for a 10-year piece of paper is probably right around 6% today. So we're very cognizant of deploying capital on a risk-adjusted basis that generates spread investing over the time while adding just phenomenal real estate phenomenal relationships and growth partners like we've done in the past with Cabot and Canyon. And we're confident there's more to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: It's actually Nick Joseph up here with Smedes. Maybe following up on that last comment. How do you think about the competitiveness of your cost of capital relative to more traditional sources of capital as you look to deploy it?\nEdward Pitoniak : And Nick, good to hear from you. By traditional sorts of capital, are you referring to the debt and equity financing available to the asset controller?\nNicholas Joseph : Exactly.\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. So clearly, a lot of the experiential landscape is made up of operators who tend to be high-yield credits. And as you well know, the high-yield market has been really quite dormant for quite a while now, going well into -- well back into last year and continuing into this year. So the access to credit is somewhat limited and the cost of it obviously has widened. And the cost of equity for many of them has at best on sideways. So as we look at the maturity walls that many debtors are facing 2024, 2025 and onward, we do think, as we talked about in the past, that we can be a virtuous source of funding through sale-leaseback structures when it comes to either refinancing debt or perhaps even more compellingly financing expansion for good operators who may have expansion opportunities, roll-up opportunities in the next few years should other operators come under any kind of refinancing pressure.\nNicholas Joseph : And then just on international expansion. Obviously, Canada is generally pretty similar to the U.S. But as you think about other kind of further expansion, how do you think about pricing regulatory and political risk from different geographies or countries?\nEdward Pitoniak : David?\nDavid Kieske : Yes. Thanks, Ed. Nick, good to talk to you. We're spending time across the globe looking where there -- where others have gone and where there's REIT friendly jurisdictions, favorable tax regimes, favorable political regimes, favorable currency, favorable funding markets. So you're absolutely right. I mean as we spent time in Canada and got our training wheels on, so to speak, with Canada, the team developed a lot of institutional learning and list a lot of institutional knowledge around how to set up structures, how to set up minimize tax leakage and ensure that we have the right protection for our income that we will potentially generate abroad. And so it goes into the black box, so to speak, and we would need to make sure that we generate significant spreads to that -- to the cost of capital because there is tax leakage. There is some risk. And so not every deal is the same. But we'll make sure that we are partnering with the right folks and underwriting the credit and the real estate quality and the future earnings growth of these potential opportunities that may come abroad.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz : Look, I think we've talked to a bunch of our companies so far. All of them over the past several months, looking for some perspective that may indicate some kind of a turn in the consumer economy or in the business economy. And I think you may have a unique perspective because you stay close to your tenants. And I just wonder what you're hearing and seeing. I know John travels around quite a bit. He was engaged on the gaming side. But if there's anything outside of gaming that we can talk about, what is your sort of economic view?\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. Well, we'll turn it over to John just to reiterate the strength we're seeing in gaming. But we can say, for example, that our partners add businesses like Cabot, like Canyon Ranch, like Great Wolf are seeing -- continuing to see very, very strong demand. Some of it, David, is obviously the COVID pent-up demand factor still exercising itself. But as you've heard us talk about in the past, we also believe we're seeing the evidence of the secular trends we've talked about at VICI, which is aging baby boomers moving into years in which they have more leisure time and millennials moving into family formation, which is obviously benefiting a business like Great Wolf. So I think, David and John, it's fair to say that our non-gaming operators are feeling everybody is confident in their outlook as we are hearing and seeing in gaming. Correct, John and David?\nJohn Payne : Yes, absolutely. And I couldn't agree more with that. I did want to take the opportunity because David asked about our Las Vegas operators and are staying in touch with them as well as our regional operators, David, we're very blessed now today have 11 tenants, right? And so we get a really good view of the entire industry, and our tenants are willing to do what we would call informal reviews with us on a quarterly basis to share with us their views on how things are going. And it's not in our leases. They do this because we form these partnerships, and it helps us better discussions about how we can help them grow. But across the gaming sector, I mean, it's really amazing to hear the results MGM released yesterday or earlier today, 36% growth in same-store adjusted EBITDAR, right, in Las Vegas. And that's an incredible number. So when I do these meetings with our team, we ask the question, where are you seeing slowness in your business, in your operating business? And there's very little slowness in any of the sectors. In fact, there's still growth in almost all of them. So it's a really interesting business, and forward bookings are still robust in Las Vegas. And then the regional markets continue to show steadiness across many of their sectors. And so it's exciting to have these partners who continue to innovate, continue to deploy capital. Many of them have seen a really nice return on the capital that they're deploying, whether it's new restaurants mixing hotel rooms that needed upgrades, et cetera.\nDavid Katz : Understood. Appreciate it. And as my follow-up. Just reading this morning and following very closely, some of the more regional lenders out there that account for, according to some of the press, 80% of commercial real estate mortgages. Is there any strategy or a way for you to approach and position yourselves to participate productively and pools of smaller deals or anything like that, given the circumstances, is there some opportunity for you to get in there and become an alternative lender?\nEdward Pitoniak : It's a really good question, David, and we are digging into it and need to dig into it deeper. I would say that based on what we've seen so far, regional banks in their commercial real estate lending are generally lending to asset categories like office, like multi-res and other categories, retail, that we won't invest in. So I'm not sure that there's a direct opportunity to get involved in categories that regional banking lenders have tended to focus on. But I do think there's an indirect opportunity in that we are seeing evidence, as is everyone, of further tightening of credit. So I do believe there is going to be enhanced opportunity for us. I'm not sure it's going to be directly from the tightening of credit by regional lenders to the conventional real estate asset classes. But I do think, David, we're very confident that we are already seeing, as evidenced by the work David and the team have done in Hard Rock Ottawa, Fontainebleau and other credit opportunities, that we're going to continue to see both enhanced credit opportunity and enhanced real estate acquisition opportunities because of the tightening for credit. David Kieske, anything to add?\nDavid Kieske : No, I think you touched on it perfectly. I echo that, that we are seeing opportunities to potentially lend capital. But when we think about our strategic lending book, we want to ensure it's with the right partners where it could lead to future growth opportunities. And I think at the regional level, less opportunity for us. But look, that will trickle up to the bigger banks, right? That will have an impact on JPMorgan's and the BofA's and the Citi's lending across the board, and so that could create opportunities for us around the experiential categories.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas : First question, David. You mentioned that the company's incremental cost of debt today, I think, is around 6%. You said your cost of equity capital continues to improve and is in that range, depending on how you look at it, and the stock is up nearly 6% year-to-date, so that's improving. Does that change the way that you think about capitalizing new investments, vis-a-vis, rising debt costs in the near term?\nDavid Kieske : Yes, Todd. Good to talk to you. And just to be clear, that 6% for a 10-year piece of paper. So obviously, different tenors have different rates. Post the MGP acquisition, we've been highly, highly focused on continuing to delever the; balance sheet. We obviously elevated leverage a little bit to bring in that phenomenal portfolio that we added to our company and to transform our company. But as you've seen us do throughout 2022 and into 2023 is going to over-equitize transactions. And as we sit here today in May 2nd, we have a maturity coming up in roughly one year. It's due May 1, 2024. And so we'll continue to use the equity, use our free cash flow to fund transactions and then things that potentially larger transactions look to add those to the balance sheet on a leverage-neutral basis.\nTodd Thomas : Okay. And then as you look ahead at all of the various investment opportunities and different sort of categories and industries that you're underwriting relative to your cost of capital, do you expect that the spread that you're investing at will improve as you look out at the pipeline over the next few quarters relative to sort of the spread that you've locked in on more recent investments here over the last couple of quarters?\nDavid Kieske : I mean I could start and others chime in. I mean, Todd, each deal is different. And obviously, we have this debate internally a lot. Sure, we'd love to say we can print a 300 basis point, 400 basis point spread to our cost of capital. But the intrinsic value of some pieces of real estate that just have -- will trade at lower cap rates and lending opportunities could be at slightly higher yields. And so as we look to balance our -- the overall yield that we generate for on our capital over the long term, we want to ensure that we are generating a 100 basis point to 150 basis point spread on a blended basis for -- based on the capital that we deploy on a quarterly and an annual basis. So while there's the hope that we can deploy capital at higher spreads, sometimes real estate is worth to get a deal done, it takes -- it might take a slightly tighter spread to ensure that we can build the partnerships and the relationships and the growth pipeline that we want to deliver over time here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.\nBarry Jonas : When you think about leaning more into new international markets, how do you think about supporting greenfield developments through, say, construction loans versus sale leaseback of existing assets?\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. Barry, I'll take that at the start and then David can add in. I would say that our confidence around funding development internationally, it needs to be basically in line with the confidence that we need to have to fund development domestically. We've added caveats that if it is international, we need to have even more compensating factors in place to compensate for the risks associated with currency and tax. But at the end of the day, we're really underwriting the credibility and the credit of the developer/operating partner. So again, whether we're talking about Europe, Japan or other jurisdictions, we won't, by any means, say, April I know we won't do it. But the underwriting will have to be even that much more rigorous. David, I don't know if you want to add to that?\nDavid Kieske : No, I think you hit it perfectly.\nBarry Jonas : That's great. And then just as a follow-up. John, I appreciate the comments on the consumer and your tenants. But MGM did talk last night about seeing maybe more growth at its luxury properties. I'm just curious if you're seeing consistent trends from a coverage perspective across your portfolio? And then maybe to what extent does this or any other dynamic influence your M&A strategy?\nJohn Payne : It's a very good question, Barry. Again, just kind of reiterating what I said about having 11 different tenants, so you get different views. And I think we've tried to build a portfolio where we have the luxury segment and then we have the kind of the middle sector and the properties that cater to them. They all seem to be continuing to perform quite well. Obviously, if a higher-end property, there's a seller who wants to move on that transaction, we're going to be prepared due to David and his team's work to go after that. If there is a regional asset that fits our portfolio where we don't have exposure, we'll be able to go after that as well. But as it pertains to the operating business, Barry, we continue to ask the questions, where are you seeing weakness and get most of the answers where we're seeing strength. And so it's -- we're going to continue to monitor. And I know we've been talking on this call a lot about nongaming and experiential and self, and Kellan Florio, who joined us as our Chief Investment Officer a year ago are out looking at these different sectors. But it is important to reiterate that we continue to love the casino business. We continue to be amazed each quarter with the results that are delivered by our partners and the -- hopefully, some future partners as well.\nEdward Pitoniak : Barry, I'll just add on to that. Yes, Barry, I was just going to add to that. Clearly, you're seeing across so many consumer sectors the strength of luxury. Based where we are in Midtown Manhattan, our neighborhood effectively feels like it's being taken over by LVMH. And that's simply because there is so much spending happening globally in these luxury categories, and it's one of the reasons our partners like Cabot and Canyon Ranch are doing so well right now being luxury brands within their respective categories of destination golf and wellness.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Kammert from Evercore ISI.\nJames Kammert: When you think about looking into these other experiential real estate sectors, is it fair to say that there might be fewer providers of capital in debt equity side such as VICI compared to other mainstream real estate. I'm just curious if that gives you a little bit of an advantage in terms of risk adjustment and how you structure the lease, et cetera, for the benefit of VICI.\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. Well, first of all, Jim, welcome to Evercore. Good to be talking to you. Yes, I'll turn it over to John in just a moment. But yes, you're absolutely right. What we're really undertaking is to prove out our hypothesis that there's a significant landscape of what we'll call experiential white space across the globe of really dynamic experiential operating businesses that have never been visited by a REIT before and have never considered before a REIT as a source of growth capital. And with that, I'll turn it over to John because he's having so many of these conversations in which he has told pretty much at the outset, wow, we've never talked to a REIT before. John?\nJohn Payne : Yes. You nailed it, Jim. That's exactly right. In many of these areas, whether it's in health and wellness, youth, collegiate, professional sports, certain forms of family entertainment, we're the first ones that have come to them with a thoughtful approach about how our capital could help them grow in many different ways. And so we literally spend two, three, four different meetings a day explaining who we are, what we've done, how we can help them. And again, to our opening remarks, it doesn't mean a transaction has to happen at the first meal we have together. It's about building a depth of incredible operators and real estate that over a period of time, we can hopefully transact and build a partnership. But you've hit on it where there just haven't been a lot of others that have taken on this task because it's not easy work and it takes a lot of time and effort and calls and e-mails and all of that. But we're happy to do it because we see the incredible amount of white space, as Ed noted.\nJames Kammert: Interesting. And where were they getting their capital before? Or do you just think this is as they visit their growth and future plans, they're just thinking more constructively about how they can monetize real estate? I'm just curious how that plays in.\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. Well, maybe I can offer Canyon Ranch as an example, Jim, whereby when we began talking with John Goff and the Canyon Ranch team back in early 2022, the conversations they principally been having when it came to growth capital or with private equity partners. And what they were concerned about with those private equity partners was, number one, the cost of the capital, given the cost that PE funding partners tend to assign to their own capital; and number two, the investment horizon of perhaps only 5 to 7 years. And so when Canyon Ranch looked at our offering and looked at our -- both our cost of capital and the fact that we want to be their capital partner forever, it was a pretty compelling alternative to conventional private equity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird.\nWesley Golladay : I just got a quick question about the VICI Property Fund. Do you expect more of those projects to kick off in a recessionary environment, being that Vegas is so strong? And more in particular, the focus I have on the question would be The Mirage project that was recently approved with the guitar on the Strip?\nEdward Pitoniak : John?\nJohn Payne : Yes. Good to talk to you, Wes. The Mirage project that the Hard Rock team is taking on is spectacular. I think we've seen the footage of it, not only the guitar tower, but the refurbishment of the whole properties. And you'd have to talk directly with the hard rock team, but I think you hear from them, they're thinking through different ways that they can finance the project with organize sits on our land and to our building, and we'd love to be a source of financing for that project longer term as they think through the details of it. And the fund in general, we've talked to many operators whether throughout our 11 tenants is how we can help them grow with larger projects on our existing assets or how we can help monetize certain assets and help them buy someone else. So we continue to have those conversations as well.\nWesley Golladay : Okay. If I could just get a follow-up. I guess the age is going to move a little bit down the street from you land parcel, at least that's what the reports are. Do you have any, I guess, updated plans for potential monetization of land parcel on the strip?\nEdward Pitoniak : John?\nJohn Payne : Well, it's exciting where the As are thinking about putting the stadium. I know that\u2019s two exciting -- there's almost two exciting, the most exciting companies, I guess, when they heard to announce, was MGM and VICI and let it sit right across from many of the resorts that we own and MGM operates. So we'll continue to see how that plays out. But it sure is helping Las Vegas become the sports capital of the world now by adding another team. And Super Bowl's coming next year. F1 is coming later in the year. So we couldn't be more excited. And you're asking to make our land and our resorts more valuable, we think it certainly does and will provide opportunities were the current properties that sit next to the new stadium that's going to be built as well as the undeveloped that we have throughout the city.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DeCree from CBRE.\nJohn DeCree : Good morning, everyone. Maybe just one for me. We've covered quite a bit of ground. David, probably for you. I think I read a footnote in the presentation that the Caesars Forum loan was repaid in May. I was wondering if you could confirm that? And does that impact the footfall on that property at all? And then I guess, part 3 is, can you let us know how much in commitments that you have unfunded outstanding for various loans?\nDavid Kieske : Yes, John, good to talk to you. Caesars repaid that loan actually yesterday, $400 million principal. It doesn't change the footfall. We actually extended the outside date to 2028 when we could call the Caesars Forum Convention Center. This is all part of Caesars deleveraging. So that continues to make our tenants stronger, and we're happy to get that capital back. And then the total commitments, I don't have that right in front of me, but I'm happy to follow up with you or Gabe, if you have that handy. Otherwise, John, we can follow up with you.\nJohn Payne : Yes, future funding commitments are about $970 million as of March 31.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste : First one is, I guess I like to know what the current house view on further investing in tribal today is and how you get comfortable if you can't own the land? And perhaps how much more meaningful could you get involved there?\nEdward Pitoniak : John?\nJohn Payne : Yes, I'll take that question. It's important to understand that today, our relationships with the three tribal nations are on commercial gaming properties, whether that's in Cincinnati, in Tunica and in Southern Indiana. I think your question is around is there ultimately going to be an opportunity with these partners or with another partner on their tribal land for us to make investments. And it's something we've talked to partners about before, and it potentially could be. But at this time, we've not made any of those investments. We really have enjoyed and will continue to build our relationships with tribal nations because they're amazing casino operators, and they're looking to deploy the capital that they've earned in their tribal nation casinos on to commercial gaming, and we're here to help them think through that if they're interested.\nHaendel St. Juste : That's helpful. And yes, I should have made that distinction there. And one more. You read that MGM recently was approved to build Japan's first casino in Osaka. I guess, given the relationship there, what's the likelihood of your interest in getting involved? And what sort of risk premium perhaps would you require?\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. We'll handle the -- it is a very big project. There's a lot of parties involved. They are obviously financing this in a credit market. Japan is quite low cost. Now we're always here to help them. If we can be of help, we will be. But I'd say we're a long way off at this point from knowing if we can help them. And if so, how we would help them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem : Two quick ones. Just one on the guidance. Can you just remind us what's the organic growth implied to get to that FFO growth number? And then on the balance sheet, I see the 5.9% debt to EBITDA. Where is that going to trend to by the end of the year or assuming no more deals?\nDavid Kieske : Hey, Ron. It's Dave. Ron, it's David. Good to talk to you. In terms of guidance, we just have our base escalation. So 2% for Caesars, 1.5% for some of the other tenants. We do not make any assumptions around CPI bumps or other potential economic changes, if that's what you're asking. And then in terms of the balance sheet, we're actually 5.7% today since the cash that came in from Caesars yesterday. So we're 5.9% at quarter end. That was just due to a little bit of a lower cash balance at quarter end. And then that's trending to kind of about 5.6x, 5.5x by year-end based on where we see the business trending.\nRonald Kamdem : Great. And then just the last one, just a lot more questions on theme parks and as I sort of talked about being open to all experiential. Is there a way to sort of dig in deeper and just sort of highlight what is attractive, what is not attractive, what markets, geographies, deal structure, anything would be helpful.\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. So I think when it comes to theme parks generically, Ron, what's appealing about them is what's, frankly, appealing about our large Las Vegas assets and frankly, a lot of our large regional assets as well, which is their big complex physical plants with big complex P&Ls that have high economic productivity in relation to the capital value of the asset. And we believe that theme parks tick the four boxes that we look at in any investment category we're looking at, which is lower than average cyclicality for consumer discretionary at large. Theme parks are very often an affordable luxury in times of recession. Not unlike ski resorts, which I used to work in. There is generally an absence of secular threat since people are not generally building rollercoasters in their backyards or having Amazon deliver them to them. There's a healthy supply-demand balance. People are generally not building a theme park. And then finally, number four, they've obviously proven their durability over, frankly, more than a century, going back to the big exhibitions and fairs of the late 1800. So a lot to recommend the category. John and Kellan and the team continue to work on getting to know the players, their needs or their capital needs and opportunities. And we'll hopefully some day be able to invest in that category.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Chris Darling from Green Street.\nChris Darling: I recognize that VICI is focused really on growing accretively. But I'd like to better understand how you evaluate the long-term profile of some of your existing assets. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about that aspect? And then when you look across your regional gaming portfolio, are there any markets or assets that maybe you're less comfortable owning for the long term?\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes, Chris. So I'll have John answer the back half of that question because we have, since our beginning, even though our beginning is only 5.5 years ago, we have actually engaged in portfolio optimization in terms of disposals. But it's a really good question to ask because we've contended for a while now that we are the first REIT to bring the net lease structure to what is genuinely Class A real estate in terms of scale, quality of fit and efficient fit and finish and economic magnitude and durability. And so you look at, for instance, our first marquee asset, Las Vegas, just over 60 years old. And as John will tell you in a moment, it had its best year ever last year. We've got weighted average lease term of around 40 years. And when we look at our Las Vegas assets, when we look at great regional assets like the #1 regional asset in America, MGM National Harbor, we have very high confidence that these assets will be economically productive and grow in value, in part because of our same-store NOI growth, which Green Street has written about better than anybody. These assets will continue to appreciate and value for decades to come. But John, do you want to talk about the approach we take at making sure neither we nor our tenants or in assets we don't want to be in anymore?\nJohn Payne : Yes, Chris, it's a very good question. And as Ed touched on, we constantly talk to our tenants, our operating partners about optimizing their portfolio. And as Ed alluded to, we -- since we started VICI five years ago, we've had a tenant come to us, [Reno] track in Louisiana that said, \"Look, this doesn't fit our portfolio. You own it.\" And we've worked together to sell the asset. There's been other situations where the tenant want it out, but we wanted to keep the real estate and buildings, and we've transferred and found another high-quality tenant. So we'll continue to do that throughout our lives running this business. And if there's a tenant that doesn't want to be in the business, we should work with them either say, \"Hey, let's sell this over a holdco or let's just find another tenant that wants to run the business.\" The other thing we do is continue to look in markets to diversify our portfolio. With cities, what states are we not currently in, in gaming as an example, where we'd love to own real estate and there's many markets throughout the United States we are not in. We have 50 properties today, but there is a lot of opportunity in markets we're not in. And then there's other markets where, boy, it would be nice to have another asset, and we continue to do that. So very good question. It's something that's top of mind that we have with our tenants, and we'll continue to optimize our portfolio over the coming years.\nChris Darling: Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe a second question for me. Just curious if you've had any recent conversations with Caesars regarding the ground-up development, I believe, in Danville, Virginia. Just given that, that project, I think, has broken ground now.\nJohn Payne : Yes, they just got approval. They'll be opening a temporary facility at that asset run by Caesars. It's also in a partnership with our other partners, the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, they're partners there as well. And so we do have conversations with Caesars about a variety of things. Could that ultimately -- would that ultimately be an asset we would be interested over time if the ownership wanted to monetize the real estate in the buildings? Yes, we would be very interested in that. And so we first look and get it up and running, get it stabilized, be incredibly successful, And there's a time that, that conversation, we look at.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to Ed Pitoniak, CEO, for any final remarks.\nEdward Pitoniak : Yes. Well, thanks for your time today, everybody. I'll go back to what I stressed on our last earnings call back at the end of February, and that is when you take the midpoint of our guidance for AFFO growth for 2023, which is 10%, combine that with our dividend yield, which is currently around 4.5, a little higher than that, you get 14.5 points of potential total return. And I would just compare that again to what you're seeing in REITs generally and even more generally, the S&P 500, which is certainly not shaping up to be a year combining 10% earnings growth and 4.5% dividend yield. So with that, we'll thank you for your time today and look forward to seeing you again in late July. Bye for now.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today by telling you how I tend to spend my Saturday mornings espresso in hand. First, I grab the FT, the old-fashioned print edition, to see what Katie Martin has to say about the state of the equity and credit markets in her Long View column. Katie can be very funny. But the long and short of it is that the market participants she's quoting these days aren't having a lot of fun. Then I might grab my iPad and catch up on any of Rob Armstrong's unhedged FT columns that I fell behind on during the prior week. Rob's response to current and prospective market conditions is rather Hamlet in character: to be or not to be, to be a bull or to be a bear or to be neither. But who is he who is neither bull nor bear? That is the question. In my second espresso, I might see with the two Michaels and one Marko, among others, have had to offer a market commentary and forecasting in the prior few days, Hartnett, Wilson, Kolanovic. I could call them the 3 archdukes of doom, but that would be unfair. Well, actually not that unfair. And these folks are formulating a rational response to the current state of the macro economy, monetary and fiscal policy and the markets. Visibility is low. Uncertainty is high. In commercial real estate, asset pricing is murky and/or subject to dispute between would be sellers and would be buyers. As a result, there's not a whole lot of trading going on. Commercial real estate trading was down nearly 70% year-over-year in March 2023. And it's not like March 2022 was a barn burner for real estate assets or portfolio trading. What does all this uncertainty and low visibility mean for how we're thinking and what we're doing at VICI? Our thinking in doing starts with our current state of earnings growth and investment activity. As you saw on last night's VICI earnings release, for Q1 2023, we generated year-over-year AFFO growth of 18.6% per share, a rate that we believe will be among the highest for REITs generally and S&P 500 REITs specifically. And to take a broader view, so far in earnings season, year-over-year Q1 2023 earnings growth for S&P 500 companies of all kinds is running at negative 4% versus VICI's Q1 AFFO growth again at 18.6%. But it's not only about growth in current earnings, it's about growing our future earnings. Along that line and even amidst this murky trading environment, within Q1, we allocated a total of $1.6 billion of incremental capital to compelling and accretive experiential property and lending investments, which John will have more detail on in a moment. And even with that $1.6 billion of capital having been newly allocated in Q1, we have approximately $859 million of equity dry powder, thanks to our unsettled forward equity and approximately $650 million in cash. Combined that with $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, and we have the funding in place to seize on further opportunity if opportunity presents itself in this current environment. Most of all, during an uncertain time like this, we keep doing what we've done at VICI from the beginning. We are always working on our future, growing relationships that have the potential to grow our business. These relationships don't have to turn into deals tomorrow, as John has noted in the past. In that vein, think about the fact that the AFFO growth VICI expects to produce in 2023 is in good measure, the result of relationship building we did many years ago with those who would end up being our partners in our Venetian and MGP transaction, which we announced in 2021. Thus, it is, to reiterate, that much of the work we are doing at VICI in 2023 is about growth in 2024, 2025 and beyond. And yet I don't mean to suggest that we are not jumping on immediate opportunities when those opportunities are compelling, as evidenced again by the $1.6 billion of capital we newly deployed in Q1 2023. Finally, we are working intensely in the present and for our future with one of the lowest G&A loads in American triple net REIT management as a percentage of revenues or of assets. Think of our G&A as a form of asset management fee. Our asset management fee understood in this way, as measured by VICI corporate G&A, runs at about 0.1% of assets under management. That's a fee load you would expect from a passive manager of an index fund. With VICI for 0.1%, you get very active investment management that has historically produced significant outperformance. I'll now turn the call to John so that he can share with you what kind of activities we have been up to and are up to. John? [Indiscernible] Well, John, I just want to -- what? Sorry, can you hear me now? If not, go ahead, John. Yes, I was just going to say, Tony, I apologize for that. When we work on relationships, we're obviously working on new ones all the time. But we also work very hard make sure our existing relationships are strong and productive, mutually productive as they can be. And thus, we were rather honored that Jonathan Halkyard, the CFO at MGM, referenced in his earnings call last night to VICI being a fantastic partner of ours. So that's a very big focus in terms of where future growth can come from, which is to say with our existing tenants. But in terms of the other relationships we're building, I'll turn it over to John. John? And Nick, good to hear from you. By traditional sorts of capital, are you referring to the debt and equity financing available to the asset controller? Yes. So clearly, a lot of the experiential landscape is made up of operators who tend to be high-yield credits. And as you well know, the high-yield market has been really quite dormant for quite a while now, going well into -- well back into last year and continuing into this year. So the access to credit is somewhat limited and the cost of it obviously has widened. And the cost of equity for many of them has at best on sideways. So as we look at the maturity walls that many debtors are facing 2024, 2025 and onward, we do think, as we talked about in the past, that we can be a virtuous source of funding through sale-leaseback structures when it comes to either refinancing debt or perhaps even more compellingly financing expansion for good operators who may have expansion opportunities, roll-up opportunities in the next few years should other operators come under any kind of refinancing pressure. David? Yes. Well, we'll turn it over to John just to reiterate the strength we're seeing in gaming. But we can say, for example, that our partners add businesses like Cabot, like Canyon Ranch, like Great Wolf are seeing -- continuing to see very, very strong demand. Some of it, David, is obviously the COVID pent-up demand factor still exercising itself. But as you've heard us talk about in the past, we also believe we're seeing the evidence of the secular trends we've talked about at VICI, which is aging baby boomers moving into years in which they have more leisure time and millennials moving into family formation, which is obviously benefiting a business like Great Wolf. So I think, David and John, it's fair to say that our non-gaming operators are feeling everybody is confident in their outlook as we are hearing and seeing in gaming. Correct, John and David? It's a really good question, David, and we are digging into it and need to dig into it deeper. I would say that based on what we've seen so far, regional banks in their commercial real estate lending are generally lending to asset categories like office, like multi-res and other categories, retail, that we won't invest in. So I'm not sure that there's a direct opportunity to get involved in categories that regional banking lenders have tended to focus on. But I do think there's an indirect opportunity in that we are seeing evidence, as is everyone, of further tightening of credit. So I do believe there is going to be enhanced opportunity for us. I'm not sure it's going to be directly from the tightening of credit by regional lenders to the conventional real estate asset classes. But I do think, David, we're very confident that we are already seeing, as evidenced by the work David and the team have done in Hard Rock Ottawa, Fontainebleau and other credit opportunities, that we're going to continue to see both enhanced credit opportunity and enhanced real estate acquisition opportunities because of the tightening for credit. David Kieske, anything to add? Yes. Barry, I'll take that at the start and then David can add in. I would say that our confidence around funding development internationally, it needs to be basically in line with the confidence that we need to have to fund development domestically. We've added caveats that if it is international, we need to have even more compensating factors in place to compensate for the risks associated with currency and tax. But at the end of the day, we're really underwriting the credibility and the credit of the developer/operating partner. So again, whether we're talking about Europe, Japan or other jurisdictions, we won't, by any means, say, April I know we won't do it. But the underwriting will have to be even that much more rigorous. David, I don't know if you want to add to that? Barry, I'll just add on to that. Yes, Barry, I was just going to add to that. Clearly, you're seeing across so many consumer sectors the strength of luxury. Based where we are in Midtown Manhattan, our neighborhood effectively feels like it's being taken over by LVMH. And that's simply because there is so much spending happening globally in these luxury categories, and it's one of the reasons our partners like Cabot and Canyon Ranch are doing so well right now being luxury brands within their respective categories of destination golf and wellness. Yes. Well, first of all, Jim, welcome to Evercore. Good to be talking to you. Yes, I'll turn it over to John in just a moment. But yes, you're absolutely right. What we're really undertaking is to prove out our hypothesis that there's a significant landscape of what we'll call experiential white space across the globe of really dynamic experiential operating businesses that have never been visited by a REIT before and have never considered before a REIT as a source of growth capital. And with that, I'll turn it over to John because he's having so many of these conversations in which he has told pretty much at the outset, wow, we've never talked to a REIT before. John? Yes. Well, maybe I can offer Canyon Ranch as an example, Jim, whereby when we began talking with John Goff and the Canyon Ranch team back in early 2022, the conversations they principally been having when it came to growth capital or with private equity partners. And what they were concerned about with those private equity partners was, number one, the cost of the capital, given the cost that PE funding partners tend to assign to their own capital; and number two, the investment horizon of perhaps only 5 to 7 years. And so when Canyon Ranch looked at our offering and looked at our -- both our cost of capital and the fact that we want to be their capital partner forever, it was a pretty compelling alternative to conventional private equity. John? John? John? Yes. We'll handle the -- it is a very big project. There's a lot of parties involved. They are obviously financing this in a credit market. Japan is quite low cost. Now we're always here to help them. If we can be of help, we will be. But I'd say we're a long way off at this point from knowing if we can help them. And if so, how we would help them. Yes. So I think when it comes to theme parks generically, Ron, what's appealing about them is what's, frankly, appealing about our large Las Vegas assets and frankly, a lot of our large regional assets as well, which is their big complex physical plants with big complex P&Ls that have high economic productivity in relation to the capital value of the asset. And we believe that theme parks tick the four boxes that we look at in any investment category we're looking at, which is lower than average cyclicality for consumer discretionary at large. Theme parks are very often an affordable luxury in times of recession. Not unlike ski resorts, which I used to work in. There is generally an absence of secular threat since people are not generally building rollercoasters in their backyards or having Amazon deliver them to them. There's a healthy supply-demand balance. People are generally not building a theme park. And then finally, number four, they've obviously proven their durability over, frankly, more than a century, going back to the big exhibitions and fairs of the late 1800. So a lot to recommend the category. John and Kellan and the team continue to work on getting to know the players, their needs or their capital needs and opportunities. And we'll hopefully some day be able to invest in that category. Yes, Chris. So I'll have John answer the back half of that question because we have, since our beginning, even though our beginning is only 5.5 years ago, we have actually engaged in portfolio optimization in terms of disposals. But it's a really good question to ask because we've contended for a while now that we are the first REIT to bring the net lease structure to what is genuinely Class A real estate in terms of scale, quality of fit and efficient fit and finish and economic magnitude and durability. And so you look at, for instance, our first marquee asset, Las Vegas, just over 60 years old. And as John will tell you in a moment, it had its best year ever last year. We've got weighted average lease term of around 40 years. And when we look at our Las Vegas assets, when we look at great regional assets like the #1 regional asset in America, MGM National Harbor, we have very high confidence that these assets will be economically productive and grow in value, in part because of our same-store NOI growth, which Green Street has written about better than anybody. These assets will continue to appreciate and value for decades to come. But John, do you want to talk about the approach we take at making sure neither we nor our tenants or in assets we don't want to be in anymore? Yes. Well, thanks for your time today, everybody. I'll go back to what I stressed on our last earnings call back at the end of February, and that is when you take the midpoint of our guidance for AFFO growth for 2023, which is 10%, combine that with our dividend yield, which is currently around 4.5, a little higher than that, you get 14.5 points of potential total return. And I would just compare that again to what you're seeing in REITs generally and even more generally, the S&P 500, which is certainly not shaping up to be a year combining 10% earnings growth and 4.5% dividend yield. So with that, we'll thank you for your time today and look forward to seeing you again in late July. Bye for now."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. Ed quoted Shakespeare's Hamlet when describing current market conditions. So I thought it would be appropriate to quote another great, Ted Lasso, when describing how the VICI team has functioned through the last 5 years of a rather volatile market. Coach Lasso said, \"The harder you work, the luckier you get.\" We saw the results of that work come together in 2022, which was a transformational year for VICI in which we doubled our size and scale, becoming one of the largest triple net REITs. 2023, as Ed just noted, is the year in which we are laying the groundwork for VICI's next phase of expansion domestically and globally across gaming and many other experiential sectors. In the first quarter, VICI closed on its first international transaction with PURE Canadian Gaming in Alberta, Canada, one of Canada's top gaming markets. We are thrilled that our first international transaction was in Canada as we believe the Canadian gaming industry presents a great opportunity for VICI as it is an established industry with many similarities to the U.S. gaming industry. This transaction will be the first of many international investments that the VICI team continues to explore across the globe. We also completed the acquisition of the remaining 49.9% stake in our Mandalay Bay/MGM Grand joint venture with Blackstone. This real estate consolidation was a great example of our high functioning partnership with Blackstone as we both accomplished important goals with this transaction, and VICI now owns 100% of 2 additional Class A resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. To spend a moment on Las Vegas. In February, over 4 million people traveled through Harry Reid Airport for the first time ever, which is 25% above February of 2022. Our operating partners continue to set all-time records and volumes in all segments continue to remain strong. Our operating partners continue to see very strong hotel occupancy and are also experiencing a nice recovery in the group and convention business. These strong operating numbers are the result of tremendous innovation and capital deployment by our tenants and their work is making Las Vegas the gaming, sports and entertainment capital of the world. We're also proud to expand our relationship with tribal nations, adding Cherokee Nation businesses of Oklahoma to our tenant roster as they enter into the lease agreement related to the Gold Strike Casino and Resort in Tunica, Mississippi. We are also supporting our partners at Hard Rock in the redevelopment of Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada by purchasing a portion of the senior secured notes funding this exciting new project. The American tribal nations are some of the best gaming operators, and we look forward to continue to find ways to help support their growth as they expand in the commercial gaming across the country. Within nongaming experiential industries, the team is intensely studying sectors we believe fit well with our VICI Properties investment criteria. We continue to meet and build relationship with owners and operators in many sectors, including health and wellness, youth, collegiate and professional sports, various forms of family entertainment, theme parks, holiday parks and other destination-based experiences. The team is forging foundational relationships with the market leaders who have ambitions to grow and see VICI as a preferred capital partner for their businesses, similar to those we helped, Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch. For this quarter, we expanded our indoor water park presence with our fourth loan to Great Wolf Lodge to fund the development of their location in Connecticut and in partnership with the Foxwoods Resort. The VICI team will make the most of this year by continuing to build a pipeline of partnerships that we believe will help us achieve our future growth goals, while at the same time expecting to deliver at least 10% of AFFO per share growth in 2023. As you've observed over the past 5 years, our team does not rest very often as we're laser-focused on building the highest quality experiential REIT in the world. Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David? Do you want me to take that? We can hear you, Ed. Yes. Tony, I won't go into specifics about the relationships we're building. We are studying the industry, countries around the world. But I just use -- we've been asked since we started the company about when we look at something that's the size and how small. I mean, I'll just use the example of a Century gaming, we did one deal. We then announced the deal in Maryland with them. And we're just -- hopefully, over time, we'll continue to build that relationship. So we really think that there are times that a smaller deal by itself may \"look small,\" but over the lifetime of a partnership or a relationship, that will get larger. And so we are chalking up miles, meeting folks face to face and traveling the world to find opportunities for our company and for our shareholders that are accretive. Well, that would have been an easier question back 5 years ago, I think, Tony, when we were just looking at gaming opportunities domestically. We could probably take the rest of the call as we look at different sectors. But I'll let David talk about how thoughtful we are in understanding our cost of capital and getting spreads when we're making investments or creating term sheets. But we're looking at a wide variety of sectors, countries in gaming and non-gaming. So David, do you want to touch a little bit on that as well? Yes, absolutely. And I couldn't agree more with that. I did want to take the opportunity because David asked about our Las Vegas operators and are staying in touch with them as well as our regional operators, David, we're very blessed now today have 11 tenants, right? And so we get a really good view of the entire industry, and our tenants are willing to do what we would call informal reviews with us on a quarterly basis to share with us their views on how things are going. And it's not in our leases. They do this because we form these partnerships, and it helps us better discussions about how we can help them grow. But across the gaming sector, I mean, it's really amazing to hear the results MGM released yesterday or earlier today, 36% growth in same-store adjusted EBITDAR, right, in Las Vegas. And that's an incredible number. So when I do these meetings with our team, we ask the question, where are you seeing slowness in your business, in your operating business? And there's very little slowness in any of the sectors. In fact, there's still growth in almost all of them. So it's a really interesting business, and forward bookings are still robust in Las Vegas. And then the regional markets continue to show steadiness across many of their sectors. And so it's exciting to have these partners who continue to innovate, continue to deploy capital. Many of them have seen a really nice return on the capital that they're deploying, whether it's new restaurants mixing hotel rooms that needed upgrades, et cetera. It's a very good question, Barry. Again, just kind of reiterating what I said about having 11 different tenants, so you get different views. And I think we've tried to build a portfolio where we have the luxury segment and then we have the kind of the middle sector and the properties that cater to them. They all seem to be continuing to perform quite well. Obviously, if a higher-end property, there's a seller who wants to move on that transaction, we're going to be prepared due to David and his team's work to go after that. If there is a regional asset that fits our portfolio where we don't have exposure, we'll be able to go after that as well. But as it pertains to the operating business, Barry, we continue to ask the questions, where are you seeing weakness and get most of the answers where we're seeing strength. And so it's -- we're going to continue to monitor. And I know we've been talking on this call a lot about nongaming and experiential and self, and Kellan Florio, who joined us as our Chief Investment Officer a year ago are out looking at these different sectors. But it is important to reiterate that we continue to love the casino business. We continue to be amazed each quarter with the results that are delivered by our partners and the -- hopefully, some future partners as well. Yes. You nailed it, Jim. That's exactly right. In many of these areas, whether it's in health and wellness, youth, collegiate, professional sports, certain forms of family entertainment, we're the first ones that have come to them with a thoughtful approach about how our capital could help them grow in many different ways. And so we literally spend two, three, four different meetings a day explaining who we are, what we've done, how we can help them. And again, to our opening remarks, it doesn't mean a transaction has to happen at the first meal we have together. It's about building a depth of incredible operators and real estate that over a period of time, we can hopefully transact and build a partnership. But you've hit on it where there just haven't been a lot of others that have taken on this task because it's not easy work and it takes a lot of time and effort and calls and e-mails and all of that. But we're happy to do it because we see the incredible amount of white space, as Ed noted. Yes. Good to talk to you, Wes. The Mirage project that the Hard Rock team is taking on is spectacular. I think we've seen the footage of it, not only the guitar tower, but the refurbishment of the whole properties. And you'd have to talk directly with the hard rock team, but I think you hear from them, they're thinking through different ways that they can finance the project with organize sits on our land and to our building, and we'd love to be a source of financing for that project longer term as they think through the details of it. And the fund in general, we've talked to many operators whether throughout our 11 tenants is how we can help them grow with larger projects on our existing assets or how we can help monetize certain assets and help them buy someone else. So we continue to have those conversations as well. Well, it's exciting where the As are thinking about putting the stadium. I know that's two exciting -- there's almost two exciting, the most exciting companies, I guess, when they heard to announce, was MGM and VICI and let it sit right across from many of the resorts that we own and MGM operates. So we'll continue to see how that plays out. But it sure is helping Las Vegas become the sports capital of the world now by adding another team. And Super Bowl's coming next year. F1 is coming later in the year. So we couldn't be more excited. And you're asking to make our land and our resorts more valuable, we think it certainly does and will provide opportunities were the current properties that sit next to the new stadium that's going to be built as well as the undeveloped that we have throughout the city. Yes, future funding commitments are about $970 million as of March 31. Yes, I'll take that question. It's important to understand that today, our relationships with the three tribal nations are on commercial gaming properties, whether that's in Cincinnati, in Tunica and in Southern Indiana. I think your question is around is there ultimately going to be an opportunity with these partners or with another partner on their tribal land for us to make investments. And it's something we've talked to partners about before, and it potentially could be. But at this time, we've not made any of those investments. We really have enjoyed and will continue to build our relationships with tribal nations because they're amazing casino operators, and they're looking to deploy the capital that they've earned in their tribal nation casinos on to commercial gaming, and we're here to help them think through that if they're interested. Yes, Chris, it's a very good question. And as Ed touched on, we constantly talk to our tenants, our operating partners about optimizing their portfolio. And as Ed alluded to, we -- since we started VICI five years ago, we've had a tenant come to us, [Reno] track in Louisiana that said, \"Look, this doesn't fit our portfolio. You own it.\" And we've worked together to sell the asset. There's been other situations where the tenant want it out, but we wanted to keep the real estate and buildings, and we've transferred and found another high-quality tenant. So we'll continue to do that throughout our lives running this business. And if there's a tenant that doesn't want to be in the business, we should work with them either say, \"Hey, let's sell this over a holdco or let's just find another tenant that wants to run the business.\" The other thing we do is continue to look in markets to diversify our portfolio. With cities, what states are we not currently in, in gaming as an example, where we'd love to own real estate and there's many markets throughout the United States we are not in. We have 50 properties today, but there is a lot of opportunity in markets we're not in. And then there's other markets where, boy, it would be nice to have another asset, and we continue to do that. So very good question. It's something that's top of mind that we have with our tenants, and we'll continue to optimize our portfolio over the coming years. Yes, they just got approval. They'll be opening a temporary facility at that asset run by Caesars. It's also in a partnership with our other partners, the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, they're partners there as well. And so we do have conversations with Caesars about a variety of things. Could that ultimately -- would that ultimately be an asset we would be interested over time if the ownership wanted to monetize the real estate in the buildings? Yes, we would be very interested in that. And so we first look and get it up and running, get it stabilized, be incredibly successful, And there's a time that, that conversation, we look at."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. 2023 started off with several very exciting transactions. Our ability to move quickly and close these acquisitions at the start of the year as a result of the liquidity we have maintained and balance sheet that we have built over the years in an effort to be nimble and act on attractive opportunities as they come before us. We will continue to focus on the balance sheet as it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve. As John mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the four PURE Canadian gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, the 49.9% interest we previously did not own in the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. And we purchased $85 million of senior secured notes issued by Hard Rock Ottawa LP. This is an exciting transaction for VICI as we partnered with a large financial institution to provide Hard Rock with a complete financing solution for the redevelopment of what will become the Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada. In addition, we announced a $287.9 million construction loan for the development of a Great Wolf Lodge, which sits on land owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation next to the Foxwoods Resort Casino. This transaction represents our fourth loan with Great Wolf for a total capital commitment of approximately $550 million to support Great Wolf's development pipeline. In January, we re-bolstered our liquidity raising approximately $965 million of available net equity proceeds through the sale of 30.3 million shares via forward sale agreements. On April 4, we physically settled 3.2 million of these shares for net proceeds of approximately $101.5 million. As we sit here today, we have approximately $3.9 billion in total liquidity, As Ed mentioned, this is comprised of approximately $650 million in cash, $859 million of net proceeds available from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility. In terms of the leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of CMBS debt that encumbers the MGM Grand/Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x today. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity. Turning to the income statement. AFFO was $528.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 73% over Q1 2022. AFFO per share was $0.53 for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% compared to the $0.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. As a reminder, the disparity between our overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from equity raise and shares issued to fund our acquisition of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay JV this quarter and to consummate our acquisitions of MGP during Q2 and the Venetian Resort during Q1 of last year. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. As a reminder, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability, leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, Elliott, please open the line for questions. Yes, happy to, John. And Tony, good to talk to yet. I mean, as you saw during the quarter, we partnered with a large financial institution and put out some capital at an 11% rate. I'm not here to say that every deal we're going to do is going to be 11%. But we are focused on a blended spread to our cost of capital, and we've -- our share price has held in our financing costs, just to get ahead of that question, is for a 10-year piece of paper is probably right around 6% today. So we're very cognizant of deploying capital on a risk-adjusted basis that generates spread investing over the time while adding just phenomenal real estate phenomenal relationships and growth partners like we've done in the past with Cabot and Canyon. And we're confident there's more to come. Yes. Thanks, Ed. Nick, good to talk to you. We're spending time across the globe looking where there -- where others have gone and where there's REIT friendly jurisdictions, favorable tax regimes, favorable political regimes, favorable currency, favorable funding markets. So you're absolutely right. I mean as we spent time in Canada and got our training wheels on, so to speak, with Canada, the team developed a lot of institutional learning and list a lot of institutional knowledge around how to set up structures, how to set up minimize tax leakage and ensure that we have the right protection for our income that we will potentially generate abroad. And so it goes into the black box, so to speak, and we would need to make sure that we generate significant spreads to that -- to the cost of capital because there is tax leakage. There is some risk. And so not every deal is the same. But we'll make sure that we are partnering with the right folks and underwriting the credit and the real estate quality and the future earnings growth of these potential opportunities that may come abroad. No, I think you touched on it perfectly. I echo that, that we are seeing opportunities to potentially lend capital. But when we think about our strategic lending book, we want to ensure it's with the right partners where it could lead to future growth opportunities. And I think at the regional level, less opportunity for us. But look, that will trickle up to the bigger banks, right? That will have an impact on JPMorgan's and the BofA's and the Citi's lending across the board, and so that could create opportunities for us around the experiential categories. Yes, Todd. Good to talk to you. And just to be clear, that 6% for a 10-year piece of paper. So obviously, different tenors have different rates. Post the MGP acquisition, we've been highly, highly focused on continuing to delever the; balance sheet. We obviously elevated leverage a little bit to bring in that phenomenal portfolio that we added to our company and to transform our company. But as you've seen us do throughout 2022 and into 2023 is going to over-equitize transactions. And as we sit here today in May 2nd, we have a maturity coming up in roughly one year. It's due May 1, 2024. And so we'll continue to use the equity, use our free cash flow to fund transactions and then things that potentially larger transactions look to add those to the balance sheet on a leverage-neutral basis. I mean I could start and others chime in. I mean, Todd, each deal is different. And obviously, we have this debate internally a lot. Sure, we'd love to say we can print a 300 basis point, 400 basis point spread to our cost of capital. But the intrinsic value of some pieces of real estate that just have -- will trade at lower cap rates and lending opportunities could be at slightly higher yields. And so as we look to balance our -- the overall yield that we generate for on our capital over the long term, we want to ensure that we are generating a 100 basis point to 150 basis point spread on a blended basis for -- based on the capital that we deploy on a quarterly and an annual basis. So while there's the hope that we can deploy capital at higher spreads, sometimes real estate is worth to get a deal done, it takes -- it might take a slightly tighter spread to ensure that we can build the partnerships and the relationships and the growth pipeline that we want to deliver over time here. No, I think you hit it perfectly. Yes, John, good to talk to you. Caesars repaid that loan actually yesterday, $400 million principal. It doesn't change the footfall. We actually extended the outside date to 2028 when we could call the Caesars Forum Convention Center. This is all part of Caesars deleveraging. So that continues to make our tenants stronger, and we're happy to get that capital back. And then the total commitments, I don't have that right in front of me, but I'm happy to follow up with you or Gabe, if you have that handy. Otherwise, John, we can follow up with you. Hey, Ron. It's Dave. Ron, it's David. Good to talk to you. In terms of guidance, we just have our base escalation. So 2% for Caesars, 1.5% for some of the other tenants. We do not make any assumptions around CPI bumps or other potential economic changes, if that's what you're asking. And then in terms of the balance sheet, we're actually 5.7% today since the cash that came in from Caesars yesterday. So we're 5.9% at quarter end. That was just due to a little bit of a lower cash balance at quarter end. And then that's trending to kind of about 5.6x, 5.5x by year-end based on where we see the business trending."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded today, November 1, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's third quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the investor section of the VICI Properties website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intend, outlook, project, or other similar phrases are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website in our third quarter 2024 earnings release, our supplemental information, and our filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and/or counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer, John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer, David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer, Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer, and Moira McCluskey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. It's an interesting world we're currently living in, isn't it? I wish this was a video call so that I could ask for a show of hands on how many of you predicted that the Fed would lower the Fed funds rate 50 bps in mid-September and over the next six weeks, the U.S. 10-year yield would rise 70 bps. If you work at a hedge fund and bet that prediction, let me know if you need help spending all the money you just made. At VICI, we never tire of trying to make sense of the times we are living through so that we can be situationally ready for the future that may arise out of the present. To tell you about one of the means we use to make sense of the times we're living through, I need you to please grab that old-fashioned thing called a pen or pencil and that old-fashioned thing called a piece of paper. Draw a horizontal or latitude line on the paper. This axis will represent consumer economic conditions. At the left end of the latitude line, put lousy, and at the right end of the line, put great. Now, through the middle of the horizontal line, draw a vertical or longitude line. This axis will represent REIT capital market condition. At the top end of the latitude line, put great, and at the bottom end of the line, put lousy. You now have one of the key maps we use at VICI to determine at any given time where we are located latitudinally and longitudinally in relation to consumer economic conditions and REIT capital market conditions and where we might be headed. Over VICI's seven years of existence, we have operated in every quadrant on this grid, and we have successfully generated earnings growth and dividend growth during our journey through all these quadrants. Given 2024's volatility, we have operated in or verged on almost all of these quadrants year-to-date. We like where we currently are, in a good position to fund the opportunities we are working on, but as always at VICI, we remain situationally ready for whatever lat-long position we may be in or headed toward. We've worked hard to develop a philosophy, strategy, and practice of capital allocation that enables VICI to allocate capital no matter which quadrant we find ourselves in at any given time. We achieve the sustained and sustainable capital allocation through two key means, internal funding capability through all cycles and investments that fund over time. When access to or cost of capital is in a negative quadrant, we want to be capable of what we've come to call capital markets independence, meaning that we have internal capital resources available to us that we can use to generate accretive external growth. At VICI, capital markets independence is funded through both retained cash flow and what we call regained cash flow, meaning repayments of loans we've made through VICI experiential credit solutions. Depending on the loan repayments received in a given year, our annual internal cash resources available for allocation can be anywhere from $350 million to $500 million. When levered with debt, this can give us $500 million to nearly $1 billion of investing power, even when, again, overall capital market conditions are not positive. VICI's ability to fund external growth no matter what quadrant we're in builds off our foundation of same-store NOI growth that, thanks to our leases, rent escalation rates, and 100% occupancy is far superior to conventional net lease REITs as documented by Green Street. We capitalize on this sustained funding capability by developing investment opportunities that enable us to put capital out the door in a regular sustained cadence, with Q3 2024 being an example of a quarter in which we announced no new transactions but nonetheless put nearly $250 million of incremental capital to work through our property partner growth fund and lending initiatives. Sustainable capital allocation is integral to a subject that we are religious about. At VICI, we are religious about the power of compounding, the compounding of earnings growth, the compounding of dividend growth, the compounding of total return. One of the keys of compounding is not go backwards, not in earnings, not in dividends, not in total return. A key to sustained forward momentum is the ability to generate earnings and value growth through all cycles in all quadrants of our BG conditions map. We don't know what the coming quarters will bring in REIT capital market conditions or consumer economic conditions, but we work every day to be ready for what may come. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John and David, who will talk about our growth outlook and current performance. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed. Good morning to all of you on the call today. We're often asked where we spend most of our time and energy, and while we've built a team that can assess the wide range of opportunities across experiential sectors and various geographies in tandem, I have said many times that casino gaming will continue to be a major driver of our growth. The size and scale of gaming assets is one element contributing to this focus, and we also like gaming because of how experiences at these assets continue to evolve, specifically in Las Vegas. We believe the tailwinds around gaming in Las Vegas will continue to create investment opportunities for VICI, similar to the Venetian Partner Property Growth Fund investment we announced during the second quarter. A recent Financial Times article exemplifies our view of the future opportunities in Las Vegas. In the article, Barry Dillard, the Chairman of IAC, shared his thoughts on his company's stake in MGM Resorts. He said, you can't disintermediate a physical experience, which is why we are betting on Las Vegas. He then goes on to say, the amount of entertainment, sports, live performances, and every possible variety and combination in Las Vegas is unequaled anywhere in the world. This quote underlies the merits of VICI's experiential real estate strategy, as well as our significant ownership of Las Vegas real estate. VICI is positioned to be a prime partner of our operators as they seek to invest further in this one-of-a-kind city. An example we have often cited is the opportunity presented by the Sports Triangle at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip, with our ownership of all six MGM assets contained within and alongside Allegiant Stadium, T-Mobile Arena, and the potential A's Stadium on the former Tropicana site. Given the increased densification and foot traffic in the area, our partners at MGM may seek to reinvest in those assets over the coming years. The scale of investment opportunity within assets VICI already owns provides us with a very unique advantage. We have also utilized our partner property growth fund with regional tenants, including Century, who this week is hosting the grand opening of their land-based casino in Caruthersville, Missouri. In 2022, VICI announced an investment of $52 million to fund development of this new casino resort at Century Caruthersville to replace the last remaining Riverboat casino on Open Water in Missouri. We have taken great care in the selection of our partners and investments to ensure not only a best-in-class portfolio with quality income, but a portfolio of investments and partners we can grow with. This ethos is foundational to our capital allocation strategy and sets VICI up well for future pipeline opportunities and consistent capital deployment. In the third quarter, we deployed $230 million of capital through various loans and partner property growth fund agreements. This has been our 13th quarter of consecutive capital deployment. VICI has built a legacy of getting better as we grow bigger, and we believe our disciplined strategy will allow us to be situationally ready to continue to deliver consistent and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\nDavid Kieske: Great. Thanks, John. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. I'll touch on our balance sheet, liquidity, results, and our updated full-year guidance. Subsequent to quarter-end, we settled 7 million shares and received approximately $201 million under our forward sale agreements. These proceeds contributed to funding the Venetian Capital investment we announced in Q2. We currently have approximately $2.9 billion in total liquidity comprised of approximately $160 million in cash and cash equivalents, $430 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards, and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized third quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, is approximately 5.4x, within our target leverage range of 5x to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.3 years to maturity. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 4.9% compared to $0.54 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model, given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $16.5 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, which continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector, but across all REITs. Turning to guidance, we are updating our AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to now be between $2.36 billion and $2.37 billion, or between $2.25 and $2.26 per diluted common share. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other non-recurring transactions or items. With that, Adam, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities. Barry, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBarry Jonas: Wanted to start with Tribal Gaming, see if you had any updated views there. Maybe you could spell out any parameters you would look for to execute any loans or sale leasebacks. Thank you.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, good morning, Barry. I think the starting point for us, VICI, is that over our seven years, led by John and the team, we have developed very positive, powerful relationships with American tribal nations. We currently have four tribal relationships. As you know, Barry, they all obviously involve partnering with tribes in commercial gaming opportunities off of tribal land. And when it comes, again, to doing business with tribes, we love doing business with them. They're commercial, they're collaborative and great to do business with. When it comes to doing business on tribal land, it is, again, not about tribes being idiosyncratic. It's about the structure that applies to tribal gaming on tribal land that is idiosyncratic. And when you have an idiosyncratic situation, it's sometimes useful to create a counterfactual that enables you to better understand the idiosyncrasy, the risks associated with the idiosyncrasy, and perhaps a better understanding of how to price the risk of that idiosyncrasy. So to create a counterfactual, I'm going to ask you, Barry, to imagine a scenario in which we announce that we've done a deal with a commercial gaming operator on freehold commercial land. But in that deal, we tell you that that commercial gaming operator is the only party in the world entitled to operate the gaming floor at the center of the asset and likely the economic engine of the asset. And moreover, that same operator owns the land underneath everything and thus would be the ground less sore to us as the ground less sea. So that is by definition a sandwich lease. And from everything we've been able to learn, that is what applies to the transaction you're implicitly referring to that got announced last week by our peers and colleagues at GLPI. We give full credit to GLPI for announcing this, for doing the work that went behind it. But I would say we are still coming up the learning curve when it comes to understanding the risks associated with that structure and how to best price the risk. At VICI, we spend a lot of time focusing on tail risk. And in fact, there may be moments when some people feel both externally and internally, maybe we spend a little too much time focused on tail risk. But in this particular case, the tail risk, again, is so idiosyncratic and so unique to this situation that we're not at a point where we can say with any confidence, okay, the code has been cracked and the idiosyncratic risks that have always applied here have either been eliminated or have been minimized to a degree where we can confidently price the risk.\nBarry Jonas: Great. I really appreciate that. Maybe just for a follow up, I wanted to touch on Vegas. I'm curious if you looked at Caesars sale of the LINQ, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you had a roofer there. And then with that sale, wondering if we could see anything happen with those 26 adjacent acres that VICI owns. Thank you.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, just to be clear, Barry, we did not have a roofer on the LINQ promenade. The assets, we have a roofer on our casino assets and not the promenade, which is a distinct property unto itself. There is an idiosyncrasy. Well, I shouldn't call it an idiosyncrasy. The LINQ promenade is not technically a net lease property. But we're very glad to see TPG and especially [indiscernible] at Acadia led by Ken Bernstein go in there. I think there's a lot of potential to continue to make that a corridor that exactly to your point can become a very powerful corridor to the land that we own in back of the promenade in the area in and around Ceasar's Forum Convention Center.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Anthony, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: John, you mentioned in your comments, just a lot of opportunities for things like, you know, reinvestment into properties and such. So I mean, can you just talk about just as you look at the pipeline, how much of it is now, really focused on on those types of investments versus, new acquisitions and whether that's changed much in the last quarter or two?\nJohn Payne: Yes, Tony, good morning. Very good question. I don't think it's changed. What I like about what we've done is created these pillars of growth. We've got opportunities to continue to have real estate acquisitions, as you referred to in my comments, the ability to grow with our property partner growth funds with assets that we already own, particularly in Las Vegas. Although, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have some opportunities in our regional assets because they're large as well. And then we have this opportunity, as Ed mentioned, in his marks with VICI Experiential Credit Solutions, our credit book where it's open doors for us to come in, provide a credit solution and then over time, hopefully flip it into real estate ownership. So Tony, I wouldn't say we're focused more today on the property partner growth funds than the other two. I like the fact that we're spending time and I've got a team now that are spending time on all three of these, which will provide growth for us for the long-term.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks. And then just the follow up there, maybe for you, John, and also, Ed, you commented about the 70 basis point move in the 10 year over a pretty short period of time. Do you think that's had any effect on just the propensity of your counterparts to want to transact or on just where pricing might need to be?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, Tony, I wouldn't say that move over the last over the last month has necessarily by itself been highly impactful, but it's all been part of a period of volatility that has just been frankly, it's been kind of nauseating. And I do think it's led to a level of indecision and inaction that is reflected certainly for us and what we've been able to come forward and tell you about. And needless to say, we very much hope that this period of volatility will soon start to pass, just to dramatize that volatility, Tony. Back in 2018, the number of days in the trading year when the U.S. 10 year moved 10 basis points or more was three. In 2019, it was seven. In 2020, it was 16. In 2021, it was eight. In 2022, it was 46 days. It was 39 days last year. And given the volatility we've seen, crikey, even this week, I think we're in the 20s now. And this is really just an example of how a lot of people have really, a lot of people on both sides of the transaction table have just been trying to figure out where am I today and where the hell am I going to be next week? And, needless to say, we are among those many in both America and globally who hope things really kind of calm down next week. And that the kind of volatility we've especially seen in the move index starts to quiet down because it has definitely led to all kinds of different behaviors by investors. And I saw where NFL ratings are down over the last month and that's attributed to the election. It's like, man, people are just so distracted and stressed out that they can't even summon the time and focus to watch NFL games for crikey's sake.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Darling from Green Street. Chris, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris Darling: Maybe for Ed, can you talk about the potential opportunity to acquire gaming assets in off-strip Vegas locations? And to the extent there's opportunity and interest on your part in pursuing that, it'd be helpful if you could elaborate maybe on what you look for in terms of yield coverage, but also how you think about partnering with the right operator in that sort of scenario.\nEd Pitoniak: And just to be clear, Chris, when you say off-strip, you're referring to the locals and downtown markets in Las Vegas?\nChris Darling: Yes, exactly.\nEd Pitoniak: Or are you speaking about regional gaming?\nChris Darling: It could be either, honestly, but I'm more so referring to within the Vegas metro area itself, just off-strip.\nEd Pitoniak: I see. Yes, good. John, John and team are doing a lot of work in that area. John, over to you.\nJohn Payne: Yes. Chris, nice to talk to you this morning. If you've been following us as you have for the past couple of years, you've heard us talk about our love of Las Vegas. And obviously, we've got great assets on the strip, but we've been spending years meeting with operators, not only in the local downtown market, but as you said, in the regional market, where they're just some fabulous assets. And you ask what we do, we obviously spend time to understand the operator's quality, the asset quality, the credit quality, what a structure of a lease could look like, how we could potentially help an operator who has assets in the local, downtown or regional market grow, not only in their current assets, but if they have a plan to grow the number of assets, how our capital could help them grow. So it's definitely been a focus of me and my team, not only recently, but also over the past couple of years. And there really are some neat places that we would love to be partners with great operators there.\nChris Darling: All right, helpful thoughts. And then maybe just one more, and this is more so focused on the regional side, outside of Vegas.\nEd Pitoniak: This was given to me by a guy, some of you know, named Mike Simanovsky, the Founder of Conversant. And it's a book by Edward Chancellor, in which he collects the essays, sorry, not the essays, the investment memos of an asset management shop out of London called Marathon. And one of Marathon's main investment theses is to identify categories that are at lower risk of excess capital being invested in the category and creating excess capacity. And I think one of the things we are mindful of right now in American regional gaming is making sure we understand market by market, the degree to which a given regulatory regime is at risk of authorizing the creation of more capacity than the market really should be able to sustain. And I think there are areas, and I would say in particular, areas like Illinois and Indiana, where I think we all have to be mindful of, okay, when is enough, enough? But in terms of the current tone of the market, regional market, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Payne: Yes, Chris, and Ed hit on this very well, just about, as you underwrite regional gaming, you should understand some of the history of it, places like Pennsylvania that added new [licensers] [ph] or Illinois that added BLTs. You start to see new states add historical horse racing machines that now look very similar to slot machines. So to your point, as we look at regional assets, and in our lifetime, we will continue to buy real estate and buildings and regional assets, but we're very thoughtful in understanding the best we can at the time, the competition that is in the market that could impact the asset that we're buying, and then potential new markets that could open up. Because as someone who's been in the business, I don't like to date myself, but I'm almost going on 30 years, I don't think there is belief that states like Nebraska or Virginia or Kentucky, which has HHR machines, would really have gaming at the moment that they do now, the magnitude that they do now. So to answer your question, we are being thoughtful and disciplined in our underwriting as we look at regional assets.\nOperator: The next question comes from Smedes Roans from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: On your last call, you talked a little bit about some of your tenants were seeing weakness, especially on the lower end of the consumer spectrum. I'm wondering if you can [indiscernible] here that kind of feedback, and if you think that might impact their propensity to kind of reinvest or to participate in your funds that you've talked about previously.\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, Smedes, good to talk to you this morning. Probably the first part is a better question for our great operators that have extensive details on their databases and where they're seeing positive growth and where they're seeing some weakness. I think you've seen the earnings that have come out, and some have talked, particularly in the regional markets, that they are seeing a little bit of slowness in the lower segments of their business. But we continue to, this is the beauty of having great partners and having quite a few of them. We continue to meet with them, talk about how they're thinking about growth, and is there a way that our different pillars of capital that I talked about earlier could help them grow, and whether that's with a property partner growth fund, whether they have a credit opportunity, whether they're building, would like to build a new hotel, whether they'd like to build a casino on land instead of on a boat. Those are all type of conversations we'd like to have and are having with our partners, and we hope that leads to growth for us with all different types of our partners.\nSmedes Rose: Thanks. And then maybe just kind of bigger picture, I need to think about coming into 2025, would you be giving a reasonable on the external growth side to think about maybe you do more frequent deals with smaller scope, or are you guys still maybe chasing the big deal, maybe in the non-gaming space that will more meaningfully drive their earnings growth next year? I guess I'm so touched about the opportunity set now that you've had more time, I guess, to think about kind of non-gaming and gaming investment opportunities and how it might play out here.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I mean, it's something we think about every day. We have set forth goals and strategies at VICI that, like any goals and strategies, have trade-offs, and anyone who thinks their strategy doesn't involve trade-offs either doesn't have a strategy, doesn't understand it, or it is not truly a differentiated strategy. And in our focus on experiential and our dedication to experiential, both gaming and non-gaming, we have to accept the trade-off that it is not a category of real estate transaction that has an endless stream of marketed processes. So we've got to do a lot of work every day, and John and the team and David and the team do work every single day, and Samantha and the team, to identify and chase down opportunities that usually are not marketed, or if they are marketed at all, it's quite quietly. As we look ahead to next year, John and David and Samantha and the teams are working on some very exciting stuff, including bigger assets in gaming, and only time is going to tell if we can bring these to full fruition. We wish, again, there are times when we wish, geez, it'd be nice to have one of these stamping machines where we just stamp out every week a few deals where maybe we bought car washes or dry cleaners or convenience stores or whatever, but that's not what we focus on, that's not what we invest in, and we have to accept the trade-off that our deal flow will be more sporadic. But as we look at 2025, and given what we're working on, we remain confident that we are going to be bringing to the table both gaming and non-gaming deals, big and small. It will continue the growth profile we've had over our seven years.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Dave from CBRE. John, your line is open, please go ahead.\nJohn Dave: Ed, John, I wanted to go back to your response to an earlier question because it's something I've been thinking about a lot, and I apologize if your answer is going to be the same, but I wanted to talk about the regional gaming landscape and the trend where we're seeing maybe some new openings and some areas where there's been a lot more unit growth, some cannibalization or same-store sales declines. You mentioned you're being very cognizant of that, but I was curious if you could go into a little bit more detail about investments and some of the things that you'd consider in underwriting. Is it higher rent coverage? Is it unique or certain operators that perhaps have a competitive scale advantage? Would you maybe only consider larger assets that have a couple larger barriers to entry? I'm just curious how you think about deploying capital in regional gaming where maybe the markets, the regulatory environment, I think is a bit more predictable given history, but John, you pointed out some markets that have casinos today that we weren't thinking about before. So I'm curious how you underwrite some of the criteria you might look at.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I'll turn it over to John in just a moment, John, but I'd say as a starting point, you really have to look at every situation market-by-market to understand what the competitive marketplace is? And for a given asset and for a given operator, what is their opportunity to carve out a profitable position in that marketplace? It won't necessarily always be the big assets. It could be small assets that in the hands of the right smaller asset operator who knows how to compete and make money with smaller assets in a given market. Those can still be very attractive to us. But it really comes down so much to the degree to which a given operator has a really, really healthy competitive response function. That's something obviously we've always valued, but I think to your implicit point, John, at a time like this, you really want to understand a given operator's ability to compete profitably for market share. John, do you want to add to that? John Payne?\nJohn Payne: Yes, I will, John. When Ed and I started VICI back in 2017, one of the things I asked myself as I left my operating career was would the views from an operator make a difference inside a REIT in the way we underwrite our real estate? To your question, this is where my old job actually has some value in underwriting the business. We can dig into the business and the beauty of our operators is they have great detail on the consumer and where the consumer is coming. If we're looking at an asset that potentially gets their guests from hundreds of miles away, the chance of impact from a new casino is probably greater than an asset that gets their consumers from 15 miles away. That's just one example of how we are going to be disciplined as we go into regional markets. Of course, we'll weigh asset quality, operator quality, credit quality, structure of lease quality, those types of things, but we can also, with our operations background, go in and better understand could it get disrupted should the landscape change? Because remember, about being disciplined, we're not investing just for the near term. I think anyone could invest for the near term and look good. Our mission is for the long term, and I think you need to be disciplined in the environment we're in and understand what could ultimately impact the business, maybe it's not this year or next year, but over the next decade.\nJohn Dave: Thanks. I appreciate the incremental color there. That's helpful. And maybe a quick one. We talked a little bit earlier also about maybe some gaming investments and opportunities in the Las Vegas locals market off the Strip, but the city is just kind of thriving in all ways. I'm curious if some non-gaming stuff outside of the Las Vegas Strip but in the Las Vegas metro area is something that's on the radar and opportunities that are starting to maybe bubble up. I mean, it's becoming a massive sports town, and so thinking about some of the other assets in your portfolio, youth sports, et cetera, is that an area of focus, non-gaming in Las Vegas off the Strip that you're paying attention to or looking at in a meaningful way right now?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, I'll turn it over to John. Yes, I was just going to say it's interesting you bring that up. We've gotten to know Jose Bautista, Joey Batts, as some of you may remember, who is now the owner of the Las Vegas Lights, the soccer team in the USL. As he looks at how he gives his team a really good home in the Las Vegas basin, one of the things we've talked about is the degree to which projects like the Homefield project we've invested in in Kansas City make so much sense in an environment like that in terms of the demand for those kind of youth sport facilities, John would agree. But, John Payne, go ahead, please.\nJohn Payne: Yes, John, it's an excellent question, and when you spend as much time as we have not only on the strip but in the locals market, downtown, and the regional market, many of the operators are entrepreneurs. They're involved in things, not only casinos, which we love casinos, but other experiential assets, and so you're right on point. Ed's right on point. Not only are we studying the opportunity to own great real estate, casino real estate, in these locals regional market of Las Vegas, other opportunities have opened up, and we'll study them and see if there's something that we can get involved in in the near term or even in the long term. Great question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Kammert from Evercore. Jim, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJim Kammert: Ed, reflecting on your earlier comments, the rates backing up and obviously a lot of volatility, I would have thought naively, does that not potentially help the Experiential Credit Solutions book, given your ability to close certainty and scale of available capital?\nEd Pitoniak: It does, Jim. It does, and I would say we've got a lot of lines in the water right now on the lending side, but the uncertainty on a week-by-week basis can cause us and any potential borrower to just wonder, well, what is market this week, right? What's my spread this week? But if I commit to this spread, what's that spread going to look like next week? So again, I think it's all part and parcel of capital markets, consumer markets, and just about every other market having been here in a state of flux and volatility that has made decision making more challenging. Jim, I'll just share with you that we began preparation of our annual long-term goals and strategic plan on July 1. We ended up presenting it to our Board at Canyon Ranch in Lenox in mid-September. Over that 70-day period, our stock went from a point that was in two percentage points of our 52-week low and then went to a new 52-week high. And over that period, the U.S. 10-year went from 4.5 down to, I think, as low as 3.6. So again, now we're talking about a period of four months, July, August, September, and October, that have just been really tumultuous. And I think it definitely has affected deal flow and it's affected how we and everybody else underwrite. But I think we all have to hope and believe that things will calm down to a degree where everybody feels a bit more conviction in the visibility and certainty of what they can commit to.\nJim Kammert: That's fair enough. Good comments. And then back to your opening comments regarding the quadrant analysis, I would imagine VICI presumes we're in the top, above the horizontal line in terms of real estate and REIT capital markets. But where are you thinking in terms of the consumer sentiment, et cetera, and how is that potentially influencing how you're thinking about investing going into 2025?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I was hoping somebody would ask that question, Jim. Where do we think we are right now? I would say, yes, we're in the upper right quadrant. Obviously, the consumer generally looks good. But I think it was Smedes who asked a little bit earlier, what is going on across the entire consumer spectrum? And are we seeing signs of potential weakness, whether it be in credit card delinquency, car loan delinquency, footfalls into retail and other metrics? And it's a bit of a mixed picture, but I think overall consumer economic conditions are quite good. And I would say REIT capital market conditions have been generally good since mid-July, but they've certainly been volatile in the last few weeks. So I would say upper right. But what we always focus on, as I alluded to, Jim, is not only where we are, but what do we think the trajectory is in terms of where we might be going. Given the amount of time it takes us to pull a deal together, we need to know where we're likely to be in a period in the future as much as we need to know where we are today.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Kilichowski from Wells Fargo. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kilichowski: Last quarter, we spent a lot of time talking about the Harrah's Hoosier Park call option. And remind me if we've spoken about this before, but when I think about that asset and the forum, there's also put options attached to that that expire December of this year. How are you thinking about those put options? Is it likely or have you made any sort of commentary or have they made commentary to you about the likelihood of them exercising those put options? And does that keep capital sidelined as you wait to see what's going to happen there?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, actually, Caesars has stated very explicitly on a number of occasions they have no intention of putting the Indiana assets to us. So, no, that has not affected how we think about our capital and our funding capabilities.\nJohn Kilichowski: Okay, understood. And then maybe on just on the election here, anything on the ballot as it pertains to regional gaming that we should be thinking about?\nEd Pitoniak: Not that I'm aware of. John Payne, are you?\nJohn Payne: Yes, there's a couple things. I mean, there's Missouri, Arkansas and Virginia, New Casino, Virginia, Arkansas, Polk County. And then in Missouri, they are talking about online sports betting as well as in New Casino and Ozark. So, actually quite quiet for gaming, particularly when you compare it to other years.\nJohn Kilichowski: Okay. And then maybe last one for me, the capital that you put to work in the quarter, there was 150 million that went to Venetian. But the other 80 you mentioned loan, and I don't know if I caught the terms of that loan or what fund that was in. Could you give us a little more color on that capital?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, John, it's David. Good to talk to you. Those are the incremental 80 odd million is incremental draws primarily under the Great Wolf loans up in Foxwoods and then the Homefield development as well as some smaller fundings for Cabot and Canyon Ranch. So, previously announced loans that have continued draw schedules.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Guglielmo from Capital One. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDan Guglielmo: It's been a tough earnings for some operators and Vegas softness seems to be on investor minds. In your experience, do Vegas trends like this impact cap rates for the casino real estate there, or is it too short term and just kind of the nature of owning those assets?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, Dan, good to talk to you. I'm going to have John Payne just remind everybody what MGM's occupancy was on the strip in Q3. But when it comes to cap rates, I would say cap rates are probably much more dependent on real estate investment capital market conditions and general valuation trends than they are on operator performance quarter-to-quarter. John, you want to just talk a little bit about how to really understand what's going on in the strip.\nJohn Payne: Well, I am a recovering operator, Dan, as you know. So, I've seen the comments about the performance of our two largest tenants, MGM and Caesars. And you look at some of the numbers and they ran, as Ed was saying, MGM ran 94% occupancy in quarter three. ADR was up some single digits. So, I know as you dig in and as they talk about what's coming up, you see some critical comments about F1, which again, long term F1 is great for the city and short term, it's great for the city. It's driving a weekend that was very slow. It's down a tiny bit from last year. It looks like we'll have to wait and see. But as Ed and I talk about, I'm not sure if a hotel company reported that they had 94% occupancy in quarter three, that there'd probably be a huge party thrown for them. So, it's interesting. It's hard to measure these large assets on an every 90 day period. And these are the best operators in the world. Every time something is thrown at them, they figure out how to continue to grow the business. When every casino was shut down during COVID, they came back and ran them more profitably than they've ever run them before. So, again, if they have a tough 90 days, they'll figure it out over the next 90, 180 next couple years. So, we feel really good about Las Vegas and the teams that are running their businesses there.\nDan Guglielmo: Thank you. Appreciate all that, color. And that makes sense. And just around the experiential partners, it's tough from kind of RC to get a view of how the Great Wolfs, Cabot, and Canyon Ranches of the world are doing in kind of this complex time. So, high level, when you all talk with those partners, what are some of the tailwinds and headwinds that they're thinking about?\nEd Pitoniak: David, you want to take that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, sure. Happy to. Dan, good to speak with you. Look, when you drill into each of the partners, they have an offering that's very unique and part of the reason we partnered with them in the first place. And so, Great Wolfs is a casino without gaming. The performance continues to be solid, maybe a little bit of fall off in the weaker consumer, the lower end consumer, similar to gaming. But the drive to destination of that offering and the affordability of that offering, you can go for a day, you can go for five days, and you don't take vacations away from your kids. And so, their business continues to be strong. They've opened four assets, three assets this year with another one opening early next year up in Foxwoods. And so, the pipeline and the performance of those assets are great. And then we've talked about with Pilgrimage Golf and Cabot, the higher end consumer, the golfer is very, very avid of going out and trying new courses. Cabot does a phenomenal job of bringing in new guests and the marketing that they do for their assets and highlighting the quality of the golf experience that they're providing. And then we've talked about with you in the past around wellness and mindfulness and people's desire for longevity and better living. And so, the Canyon Ranches of the world are performing well and continue to attract customers and provide a level of service that is second to none.\nOperator: The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Caitlin, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Cohen: Hi, this is Jeremy Cohen for Caitlin. I know you guys mentioned that this was the start of the property growth agreement with the Venetian. Are there any other specific partner property growth opportunities in the pipeline you're considering or can approach by? Thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: We continuously look for opportunities to invest in our current assets, particularly the ones in Las Vegas. We don't have anything to announce, but as I said in my opening remarks, the Sports Triangle where we own six assets around an area of the town that is growing and becoming more dense, we hope over the coming years there'll be an opportunity for us to invest there, but nothing to announce at this time.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, Jeremy, I was just going to add for those of you who don't follow MGM, I'd encourage you to go look at their Q3 earnings deck, which does have a few pages talking about exactly what John Payne just talked about, which is the opportunity to intensify, densify the assets that MGM operates and that we own in the area defined by Allegiant, T-Mobile Arena, and the forthcoming A-Stadium. We stand to be, together with MGM, the biggest beneficiaries of the intensification of that area of Las Vegas. In fact, there's a credit analyst out there who speculated that MGM will actually be the greatest beneficiary when the A-Stadium comes into operation.\nJeremy Cohen: Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, one more question. As VICI continues to build relationships and explore opportunities to get recurring transactions and growth, would you say the majority of these new relationships are in the non-gaming space?\nEd Pitoniak: John or David, you want to take that?\nJohn Payne: I'll take that. I wouldn't necessarily say it's more non-gaming at all. There's still opportunities on the gaming side. As we said before, the non-gaming and experiential transactions most likely will be of smaller scale than the gaming side. So, we may have more frequent smaller, and that may lead to more non-gaming partners. But there's still many opportunities with new partners in the casino space, not only in the United States, but all over the world.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. And let me just add that, and because nobody's asked about it in a little while, and that, of course, has to do with the New York gaming license approval process. But when, well, I should say if the day comes, and when the day comes, we hope, that MGM is granted a full gaming license for the property that we own the real estate of in Yonkers, that will be a major property partner growth fund opportunity for VICI.\nOperator: Next question comes on David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: I think you may have answered this in part, but I do want to just double back on the non-gaming opportunities, which today are small. And John, I think you touched on the fact that they perhaps remain small. If we look out a little longer term and start thinking three to five years, can they become something that is more or less than 10% or 15%, or I don't expect you to necessarily put a number on it, but give us a vision for how those could become much larger and longer term, please.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I think, David, the way we think about it is really in the context of how do we build our rent base on a year-by-year basis with an ambition to grow the rent base at a base level about maybe three odd percent a year, right? And so that would represent on our current rent base a run rate of about 90 odd million bucks of new rent every year. And so we evaluate every opportunity, including non-gaming opportunities on the degree to which they can contribute to growing rent by a percentage point or two or three. And so when we speak about these smaller non-gaming deals, they are small by the standards of VICI deals. They are actually really large by the standards of conventional net lease deals, which tend to involve buying stores that might have between $200,000 and $400,000 of rent per box versus us doing deals that generally are going to have rents of many millions of dollars of rent per box.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Ronald, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Jenny on for Ron, and thank you for taking my question. I think the first is I want to dig a little deeper on youth sports or recreational sports sector. Can you talk a little bit more on the outlook of this sector? And not only in Vegas, but nationwide, do you see more opportunities for growth? And do you look to do more strategic investment in this area in the next three to five years? Thanks.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, Jenny. Well, we definitely do. And I think you can see how this is manifesting itself in certain private equity firm investments in youth sport. Harris Blitzer is obviously a very good example, or I should say David Blitzer's family office is a great example of a company that's really focused on youth sport. And you see that in a number of shops. And they're all capitalizing on the way in which youth sport has grown as a key, key component of youth and family culture. And it's a little hard to tell exactly right now, given the data, what the youth population is going to look like over the coming years. But I can tell you anecdotally, there are a lot of little kids out there right now. Again, I'm not sure the data totally picks it up. But we were comparing notes on Halloween trigger treating participation rates last night. And I know, and Samantha was just blown away by how many kids were roaming the streets of Westport, Connecticut. And there's a lot of kids out there, and a lot of them are going to play sports at a high level. And we think that the need for facilities is only going to grow.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, I agree. The data side is a little bit tricky to get for youth sports. I guess my second question is, I want to know if you want to discuss more on the talent diversification strategy, like acknowledging VICI already have a pretty diversified talent base. But is there any specific sector that you think you want to broaden the current talent base? Any specific sector that you prefer going forward? Do you have more exposure?\nEd Pitoniak: John or David?\nJohn Payne: Well, I'll talk. I think the question was about\nDavid Kieske: Go ahead, John.\nJohn Payne: Go ahead, David. No, go ahead. Go ahead.\nDavid Kieske: Yes, I think the question, Jenny, just to make sure I heard you, is about Canada, right? And we look at Canada, we look at the globe internationally. And John touched on this comment about gaming operators earlier, that there's both gaming and non-gaming opportunities across the globe. We've spoken with a lot of you about how our team has really mapped the globe and tried to focus on where we can buy real estate. And that's a function of currency markets, rule of law, tax regime. Certain countries have very, very high foreign taxes on foreign real estate ownership, so that negates some of the competitive opportunity. But specifically in Canada, we've obviously made our first foreign investment into Canada since then. We've gone into Scotland, into St. Lucia. We'd like to do both more gaming and non-gaming north of the border. And we think there's great operators up there, great economies up there, great parts of the experiential spectrum that we'd like to go into. And so we don't have anything immediate, as John would say, but hopefully there's more to come up there.\nOperator: I'll now hand the call back to Edward for some closing remarks.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Thank you, Adam. Thanks to everybody for joining us today. And hey, guess what? Guess where NAREIT is, this November in, I guess it's just a couple of weeks. It is in Las Vegas. We hope we see many of you there. We've got a lot of great events that are going to help showcase what's going on in Las Vegas and reach out to some of our respective banking partners if you're interested in those events because they're going to be fun. With that, bye for now.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. It's an interesting world we're currently living in, isn't it? I wish this was a video call so that I could ask for a show of hands on how many of you predicted that the Fed would lower the Fed funds rate 50 bps in mid-September and over the next six weeks, the U.S. 10-year yield would rise 70 bps. If you work at a hedge fund and bet that prediction, let me know if you need help spending all the money you just made. At VICI, we never tire of trying to make sense of the times we are living through so that we can be situationally ready for the future that may arise out of the present. To tell you about one of the means we use to make sense of the times we're living through, I need you to please grab that old-fashioned thing called a pen or pencil and that old-fashioned thing called a piece of paper. Draw a horizontal or latitude line on the paper. This axis will represent consumer economic conditions. At the left end of the latitude line, put lousy, and at the right end of the line, put great. Now, through the middle of the horizontal line, draw a vertical or longitude line. This axis will represent REIT capital market condition. At the top end of the latitude line, put great, and at the bottom end of the line, put lousy. You now have one of the key maps we use at VICI to determine at any given time where we are located latitudinally and longitudinally in relation to consumer economic conditions and REIT capital market conditions and where we might be headed. Over VICI's seven years of existence, we have operated in every quadrant on this grid, and we have successfully generated earnings growth and dividend growth during our journey through all these quadrants. Given 2024's volatility, we have operated in or verged on almost all of these quadrants year-to-date. We like where we currently are, in a good position to fund the opportunities we are working on, but as always at VICI, we remain situationally ready for whatever lat-long position we may be in or headed toward. We've worked hard to develop a philosophy, strategy, and practice of capital allocation that enables VICI to allocate capital no matter which quadrant we find ourselves in at any given time. We achieve the sustained and sustainable capital allocation through two key means, internal funding capability through all cycles and investments that fund over time. When access to or cost of capital is in a negative quadrant, we want to be capable of what we've come to call capital markets independence, meaning that we have internal capital resources available to us that we can use to generate accretive external growth. At VICI, capital markets independence is funded through both retained cash flow and what we call regained cash flow, meaning repayments of loans we've made through VICI experiential credit solutions. Depending on the loan repayments received in a given year, our annual internal cash resources available for allocation can be anywhere from $350 million to $500 million. When levered with debt, this can give us $500 million to nearly $1 billion of investing power, even when, again, overall capital market conditions are not positive. VICI's ability to fund external growth no matter what quadrant we're in builds off our foundation of same-store NOI growth that, thanks to our leases, rent escalation rates, and 100% occupancy is far superior to conventional net lease REITs as documented by Green Street. We capitalize on this sustained funding capability by developing investment opportunities that enable us to put capital out the door in a regular sustained cadence, with Q3 2024 being an example of a quarter in which we announced no new transactions but nonetheless put nearly $250 million of incremental capital to work through our property partner growth fund and lending initiatives. Sustainable capital allocation is integral to a subject that we are religious about. At VICI, we are religious about the power of compounding, the compounding of earnings growth, the compounding of dividend growth, the compounding of total return. One of the keys of compounding is not go backwards, not in earnings, not in dividends, not in total return. A key to sustained forward momentum is the ability to generate earnings and value growth through all cycles in all quadrants of our BG conditions map. We don't know what the coming quarters will bring in REIT capital market conditions or consumer economic conditions, but we work every day to be ready for what may come. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John and David, who will talk about our growth outlook and current performance. John? Yes, good morning, Barry. I think the starting point for us, VICI, is that over our seven years, led by John and the team, we have developed very positive, powerful relationships with American tribal nations. We currently have four tribal relationships. As you know, Barry, they all obviously involve partnering with tribes in commercial gaming opportunities off of tribal land. And when it comes, again, to doing business with tribes, we love doing business with them. They're commercial, they're collaborative and great to do business with. When it comes to doing business on tribal land, it is, again, not about tribes being idiosyncratic. It's about the structure that applies to tribal gaming on tribal land that is idiosyncratic. And when you have an idiosyncratic situation, it's sometimes useful to create a counterfactual that enables you to better understand the idiosyncrasy, the risks associated with the idiosyncrasy, and perhaps a better understanding of how to price the risk of that idiosyncrasy. So to create a counterfactual, I'm going to ask you, Barry, to imagine a scenario in which we announce that we've done a deal with a commercial gaming operator on freehold commercial land. But in that deal, we tell you that that commercial gaming operator is the only party in the world entitled to operate the gaming floor at the center of the asset and likely the economic engine of the asset. And moreover, that same operator owns the land underneath everything and thus would be the ground less sore to us as the ground less sea. So that is by definition a sandwich lease. And from everything we've been able to learn, that is what applies to the transaction you're implicitly referring to that got announced last week by our peers and colleagues at GLPI. We give full credit to GLPI for announcing this, for doing the work that went behind it. But I would say we are still coming up the learning curve when it comes to understanding the risks associated with that structure and how to best price the risk. At VICI, we spend a lot of time focusing on tail risk. And in fact, there may be moments when some people feel both externally and internally, maybe we spend a little too much time focused on tail risk. But in this particular case, the tail risk, again, is so idiosyncratic and so unique to this situation that we're not at a point where we can say with any confidence, okay, the code has been cracked and the idiosyncratic risks that have always applied here have either been eliminated or have been minimized to a degree where we can confidently price the risk. Yes, just to be clear, Barry, we did not have a roofer on the LINQ promenade. The assets, we have a roofer on our casino assets and not the promenade, which is a distinct property unto itself. There is an idiosyncrasy. Well, I shouldn't call it an idiosyncrasy. The LINQ promenade is not technically a net lease property. But we're very glad to see TPG and especially [indiscernible] at Acadia led by Ken Bernstein go in there. I think there's a lot of potential to continue to make that a corridor that exactly to your point can become a very powerful corridor to the land that we own in back of the promenade in the area in and around Ceasar's Forum Convention Center. Yes, Tony, I wouldn't say that move over the last over the last month has necessarily by itself been highly impactful, but it's all been part of a period of volatility that has just been frankly, it's been kind of nauseating. And I do think it's led to a level of indecision and inaction that is reflected certainly for us and what we've been able to come forward and tell you about. And needless to say, we very much hope that this period of volatility will soon start to pass, just to dramatize that volatility, Tony. Back in 2018, the number of days in the trading year when the U.S. 10 year moved 10 basis points or more was three. In 2019, it was seven. In 2020, it was 16. In 2021, it was eight. In 2022, it was 46 days. It was 39 days last year. And given the volatility we've seen, crikey, even this week, I think we're in the 20s now. And this is really just an example of how a lot of people have really, a lot of people on both sides of the transaction table have just been trying to figure out where am I today and where the hell am I going to be next week? And, needless to say, we are among those many in both America and globally who hope things really kind of calm down next week. And that the kind of volatility we've especially seen in the move index starts to quiet down because it has definitely led to all kinds of different behaviors by investors. And I saw where NFL ratings are down over the last month and that's attributed to the election. It's like, man, people are just so distracted and stressed out that they can't even summon the time and focus to watch NFL games for crikey's sake. And just to be clear, Chris, when you say off-strip, you're referring to the locals and downtown markets in Las Vegas? Or are you speaking about regional gaming? I see. Yes, good. John, John and team are doing a lot of work in that area. John, over to you. This was given to me by a guy, some of you know, named Mike Simanovsky, the Founder of Conversant. And it's a book by Edward Chancellor, in which he collects the essays, sorry, not the essays, the investment memos of an asset management shop out of London called Marathon. And one of Marathon's main investment theses is to identify categories that are at lower risk of excess capital being invested in the category and creating excess capacity. And I think one of the things we are mindful of right now in American regional gaming is making sure we understand market by market, the degree to which a given regulatory regime is at risk of authorizing the creation of more capacity than the market really should be able to sustain. And I think there are areas, and I would say in particular, areas like Illinois and Indiana, where I think we all have to be mindful of, okay, when is enough, enough? But in terms of the current tone of the market, regional market, I'll turn it over to John. John? Yes, I mean, it's something we think about every day. We have set forth goals and strategies at VICI that, like any goals and strategies, have trade-offs, and anyone who thinks their strategy doesn't involve trade-offs either doesn't have a strategy, doesn't understand it, or it is not truly a differentiated strategy. And in our focus on experiential and our dedication to experiential, both gaming and non-gaming, we have to accept the trade-off that it is not a category of real estate transaction that has an endless stream of marketed processes. So we've got to do a lot of work every day, and John and the team and David and the team do work every single day, and Samantha and the team, to identify and chase down opportunities that usually are not marketed, or if they are marketed at all, it's quite quietly. As we look ahead to next year, John and David and Samantha and the teams are working on some very exciting stuff, including bigger assets in gaming, and only time is going to tell if we can bring these to full fruition. We wish, again, there are times when we wish, geez, it'd be nice to have one of these stamping machines where we just stamp out every week a few deals where maybe we bought car washes or dry cleaners or convenience stores or whatever, but that's not what we focus on, that's not what we invest in, and we have to accept the trade-off that our deal flow will be more sporadic. But as we look at 2025, and given what we're working on, we remain confident that we are going to be bringing to the table both gaming and non-gaming deals, big and small. It will continue the growth profile we've had over our seven years. Yes, I'll turn it over to John in just a moment, John, but I'd say as a starting point, you really have to look at every situation market-by-market to understand what the competitive marketplace is? And for a given asset and for a given operator, what is their opportunity to carve out a profitable position in that marketplace? It won't necessarily always be the big assets. It could be small assets that in the hands of the right smaller asset operator who knows how to compete and make money with smaller assets in a given market. Those can still be very attractive to us. But it really comes down so much to the degree to which a given operator has a really, really healthy competitive response function. That's something obviously we've always valued, but I think to your implicit point, John, at a time like this, you really want to understand a given operator's ability to compete profitably for market share. John, do you want to add to that? John Payne? Yes, I'll turn it over to John. Yes, I was just going to say it's interesting you bring that up. We've gotten to know Jose Bautista, Joey Batts, as some of you may remember, who is now the owner of the Las Vegas Lights, the soccer team in the USL. As he looks at how he gives his team a really good home in the Las Vegas basin, one of the things we've talked about is the degree to which projects like the Homefield project we've invested in in Kansas City make so much sense in an environment like that in terms of the demand for those kind of youth sport facilities, John would agree. But, John Payne, go ahead, please. It does, Jim. It does, and I would say we've got a lot of lines in the water right now on the lending side, but the uncertainty on a week-by-week basis can cause us and any potential borrower to just wonder, well, what is market this week, right? What's my spread this week? But if I commit to this spread, what's that spread going to look like next week? So again, I think it's all part and parcel of capital markets, consumer markets, and just about every other market having been here in a state of flux and volatility that has made decision making more challenging. Jim, I'll just share with you that we began preparation of our annual long-term goals and strategic plan on July 1. We ended up presenting it to our Board at Canyon Ranch in Lenox in mid-September. Over that 70-day period, our stock went from a point that was in two percentage points of our 52-week low and then went to a new 52-week high. And over that period, the U.S. 10-year went from 4.5 down to, I think, as low as 3.6. So again, now we're talking about a period of four months, July, August, September, and October, that have just been really tumultuous. And I think it definitely has affected deal flow and it's affected how we and everybody else underwrite. But I think we all have to hope and believe that things will calm down to a degree where everybody feels a bit more conviction in the visibility and certainty of what they can commit to. Yes. I was hoping somebody would ask that question, Jim. Where do we think we are right now? I would say, yes, we're in the upper right quadrant. Obviously, the consumer generally looks good. But I think it was Smedes who asked a little bit earlier, what is going on across the entire consumer spectrum? And are we seeing signs of potential weakness, whether it be in credit card delinquency, car loan delinquency, footfalls into retail and other metrics? And it's a bit of a mixed picture, but I think overall consumer economic conditions are quite good. And I would say REIT capital market conditions have been generally good since mid-July, but they've certainly been volatile in the last few weeks. So I would say upper right. But what we always focus on, as I alluded to, Jim, is not only where we are, but what do we think the trajectory is in terms of where we might be going. Given the amount of time it takes us to pull a deal together, we need to know where we're likely to be in a period in the future as much as we need to know where we are today. Yes, actually, Caesars has stated very explicitly on a number of occasions they have no intention of putting the Indiana assets to us. So, no, that has not affected how we think about our capital and our funding capabilities. Not that I'm aware of. John Payne, are you? David? Yes, Dan, good to talk to you. I'm going to have John Payne just remind everybody what MGM's occupancy was on the strip in Q3. But when it comes to cap rates, I would say cap rates are probably much more dependent on real estate investment capital market conditions and general valuation trends than they are on operator performance quarter-to-quarter. John, you want to just talk a little bit about how to really understand what's going on in the strip. David, you want to take that? John? Yes, Jeremy, I was just going to add for those of you who don't follow MGM, I'd encourage you to go look at their Q3 earnings deck, which does have a few pages talking about exactly what John Payne just talked about, which is the opportunity to intensify, densify the assets that MGM operates and that we own in the area defined by Allegiant, T-Mobile Arena, and the forthcoming A-Stadium. We stand to be, together with MGM, the biggest beneficiaries of the intensification of that area of Las Vegas. In fact, there's a credit analyst out there who speculated that MGM will actually be the greatest beneficiary when the A-Stadium comes into operation. John or David, you want to take that? Yes. And let me just add that, and because nobody's asked about it in a little while, and that, of course, has to do with the New York gaming license approval process. But when, well, I should say if the day comes, and when the day comes, we hope, that MGM is granted a full gaming license for the property that we own the real estate of in Yonkers, that will be a major property partner growth fund opportunity for VICI. Yes. I think, David, the way we think about it is really in the context of how do we build our rent base on a year-by-year basis with an ambition to grow the rent base at a base level about maybe three odd percent a year, right? And so that would represent on our current rent base a run rate of about 90 odd million bucks of new rent every year. And so we evaluate every opportunity, including non-gaming opportunities on the degree to which they can contribute to growing rent by a percentage point or two or three. And so when we speak about these smaller non-gaming deals, they are small by the standards of VICI deals. They are actually really large by the standards of conventional net lease deals, which tend to involve buying stores that might have between $200,000 and $400,000 of rent per box versus us doing deals that generally are going to have rents of many millions of dollars of rent per box. Yes, Jenny. Well, we definitely do. And I think you can see how this is manifesting itself in certain private equity firm investments in youth sport. Harris Blitzer is obviously a very good example, or I should say David Blitzer's family office is a great example of a company that's really focused on youth sport.

And there's a lot of kids out there, and a lot of them are going to play sports at a high level. And we think that the need for facilities is only going to grow. John or David? Yes. Thank you, Adam. Thanks to everybody for joining us today. And hey, guess what? Guess where NAREIT is, this November in, I guess it's just a couple of weeks. It is in Las Vegas. We hope we see many of you there. We've got a lot of great events that are going to help showcase what's going on in Las Vegas and reach out to some of our respective banking partners if you're interested in those events because they're going to be fun. With that, bye for now."

            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning to all of you on the call today. We're often asked where we spend most of our time and energy, and while we've built a team that can assess the wide range of opportunities across experiential sectors and various geographies in tandem, I have said many times that casino gaming will continue to be a major driver of our growth. The size and scale of gaming assets is one element contributing to this focus, and we also like gaming because of how experiences at these assets continue to evolve, specifically in Las Vegas. We believe the tailwinds around gaming in Las Vegas will continue to create investment opportunities for VICI, similar to the Venetian Partner Property Growth Fund investment we announced during the second quarter. A recent Financial Times article exemplifies our view of the future opportunities in Las Vegas. In the article, Barry Dillard, the Chairman of IAC, shared his thoughts on his company's stake in MGM Resorts. He said, you can't disintermediate a physical experience, which is why we are betting on Las Vegas. He then goes on to say, the amount of entertainment, sports, live performances, and every possible variety and combination in Las Vegas is unequaled anywhere in the world. This quote underlies the merits of VICI's experiential real estate strategy, as well as our significant ownership of Las Vegas real estate. VICI is positioned to be a prime partner of our operators as they seek to invest further in this one-of-a-kind city. An example we have often cited is the opportunity presented by the Sports Triangle at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip, with our ownership of all six MGM assets contained within and alongside Allegiant Stadium, T-Mobile Arena, and the potential A's Stadium on the former Tropicana site. Given the increased densification and foot traffic in the area, our partners at MGM may seek to reinvest in those assets over the coming years. The scale of investment opportunity within assets VICI already owns provides us with a very unique advantage. We have also utilized our partner property growth fund with regional tenants, including Century, who this week is hosting the grand opening of their land-based casino in Caruthersville, Missouri. In 2022, VICI announced an investment of $52 million to fund development of this new casino resort at Century Caruthersville to replace the last remaining Riverboat casino on Open Water in Missouri. We have taken great care in the selection of our partners and investments to ensure not only a best-in-class portfolio with quality income, but a portfolio of investments and partners we can grow with. This ethos is foundational to our capital allocation strategy and sets VICI up well for future pipeline opportunities and consistent capital deployment. In the third quarter, we deployed $230 million of capital through various loans and partner property growth fund agreements. This has been our 13th quarter of consecutive capital deployment. VICI has built a legacy of getting better as we grow bigger, and we believe our disciplined strategy will allow us to be situationally ready to continue to deliver consistent and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David? Yes, Tony, good morning. Very good question. I don't think it's changed. What I like about what we've done is created these pillars of growth. We've got opportunities to continue to have real estate acquisitions, as you referred to in my comments, the ability to grow with our property partner growth funds with assets that we already own, particularly in Las Vegas. Although, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have some opportunities in our regional assets because they're large as well. And then we have this opportunity, as Ed mentioned, in his marks with VICI Experiential Credit Solutions, our credit book where it's open doors for us to come in, provide a credit solution and then over time, hopefully flip it into real estate ownership. So Tony, I wouldn't say we're focused more today on the property partner growth funds than the other two. I like the fact that we're spending time and I've got a team now that are spending time on all three of these, which will provide growth for us for the long-term. Yes. Chris, nice to talk to you this morning. If you've been following us as you have for the past couple of years, you've heard us talk about our love of Las Vegas. And obviously, we've got great assets on the strip, but we've been spending years meeting with operators, not only in the local downtown market, but as you said, in the regional market, where they're just some fabulous assets. And you ask what we do, we obviously spend time to understand the operator's quality, the asset quality, the credit quality, what a structure of a lease could look like, how we could potentially help an operator who has assets in the local, downtown or regional market grow, not only in their current assets, but if they have a plan to grow the number of assets, how our capital could help them grow. So it's definitely been a focus of me and my team, not only recently, but also over the past couple of years. And there really are some neat places that we would love to be partners with great operators there. Yes, Chris, and Ed hit on this very well, just about, as you underwrite regional gaming, you should understand some of the history of it, places like Pennsylvania that added new [licensers] [ph] or Illinois that added BLTs. You start to see new states add historical horse racing machines that now look very similar to slot machines. So to your point, as we look at regional assets, and in our lifetime, we will continue to buy real estate and buildings and regional assets, but we're very thoughtful in understanding the best we can at the time, the competition that is in the market that could impact the asset that we're buying, and then potential new markets that could open up. Because as someone who's been in the business, I don't like to date myself, but I'm almost going on 30 years, I don't think there is belief that states like Nebraska or Virginia or Kentucky, which has HHR machines, would really have gaming at the moment that they do now, the magnitude that they do now. So to answer your question, we are being thoughtful and disciplined in our underwriting as we look at regional assets. Yes, Smedes, good to talk to you this morning. Probably the first part is a better question for our great operators that have extensive details on their databases and where they're seeing positive growth and where they're seeing some weakness. I think you've seen the earnings that have come out, and some have talked, particularly in the regional markets, that they are seeing a little bit of slowness in the lower segments of their business. But we continue to, this is the beauty of having great partners and having quite a few of them. We continue to meet with them, talk about how they're thinking about growth, and is there a way that our different pillars of capital that I talked about earlier could help them grow, and whether that's with a property partner growth fund, whether they have a credit opportunity, whether they're building, would like to build a new hotel, whether they'd like to build a casino on land instead of on a boat. Those are all type of conversations we'd like to have and are having with our partners, and we hope that leads to growth for us with all different types of our partners. Yes, I will, John. When Ed and I started VICI back in 2017, one of the things I asked myself as I left my operating career was would the views from an operator make a difference inside a REIT in the way we underwrite our real estate? To your question, this is where my old job actually has some value in underwriting the business. We can dig into the business and the beauty of our operators is they have great detail on the consumer and where the consumer is coming. If we're looking at an asset that potentially gets their guests from hundreds of miles away, the chance of impact from a new casino is probably greater than an asset that gets their consumers from 15 miles away. That's just one example of how we are going to be disciplined as we go into regional markets. Of course, we'll weigh asset quality, operator quality, credit quality, structure of lease quality, those types of things, but we can also, with our operations background, go in and better understand could it get disrupted should the landscape change? Because remember, about being disciplined, we're not investing just for the near term. I think anyone could invest for the near term and look good. Our mission is for the long term, and I think you need to be disciplined in the environment we're in and understand what could ultimately impact the business, maybe it's not this year or next year, but over the next decade. Yes, John, it's an excellent question, and when you spend as much time as we have not only on the strip but in the locals market, downtown, and the regional market, many of the operators are entrepreneurs. They're involved in things, not only casinos, which we love casinos, but other experiential assets, and so you're right on point. Ed's right on point. Not only are we studying the opportunity to own great real estate, casino real estate, in these locals regional market of Las Vegas, other opportunities have opened up, and we'll study them and see if there's something that we can get involved in in the near term or even in the long term. Great question. Yes, there's a couple things. I mean, there's Missouri, Arkansas and Virginia, New Casino, Virginia, Arkansas, Polk County. And then in Missouri, they are talking about online sports betting as well as in New Casino and Ozark. So, actually quite quiet for gaming, particularly when you compare it to other years. Well, I am a recovering operator, Dan, as you know. So, I've seen the comments about the performance of our two largest tenants, MGM and Caesars. And you look at some of the numbers and they ran, as Ed was saying, MGM ran 94% occupancy in quarter three. ADR was up some single digits. So, I know as you dig in and as they talk about what's coming up, you see some critical comments about F1, which again, long term F1 is great for the city and short term, it's great for the city. It's driving a weekend that was very slow. It's down a tiny bit from last year. It looks like we'll have to wait and see. But as Ed and I talk about, I'm not sure if a hotel company reported that they had 94% occupancy in quarter three, that there'd probably be a huge party thrown for them. So, it's interesting. It's hard to measure these large assets on an every 90 day period. And these are the best operators in the world. Every time something is thrown at them, they figure out how to continue to grow the business. When every casino was shut down during COVID, they came back and ran them more profitably than they've ever run them before. So, again, if they have a tough 90 days, they'll figure it out over the next 90, 180 next couple years. So, we feel really good about Las Vegas and the teams that are running their businesses there. We continuously look for opportunities to invest in our current assets, particularly the ones in Las Vegas. We don't have anything to announce, but as I said in my opening remarks, the Sports Triangle where we own six assets around an area of the town that is growing and becoming more dense, we hope over the coming years there'll be an opportunity for us to invest there, but nothing to announce at this time. I'll take that. I wouldn't necessarily say it's more non-gaming at all. There's still opportunities on the gaming side. As we said before, the non-gaming and experiential transactions most likely will be of smaller scale than the gaming side. So, we may have more frequent smaller, and that may lead to more non-gaming partners. But there's still many opportunities with new partners in the casino space, not only in the United States, but all over the world. Well, I'll talk. I think the question was about Go ahead, David. No, go ahead. Go ahead."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, John. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. I'll touch on our balance sheet, liquidity, results, and our updated full-year guidance. Subsequent to quarter-end, we settled 7 million shares and received approximately $201 million under our forward sale agreements. These proceeds contributed to funding the Venetian Capital investment we announced in Q2. We currently have approximately $2.9 billion in total liquidity comprised of approximately $160 million in cash and cash equivalents, $430 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards, and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized third quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, is approximately 5.4x, within our target leverage range of 5x to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36% taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.3 years to maturity. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 4.9% compared to $0.54 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model, given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating non-cash items. Our G&A was $16.5 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, which continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector, but across all REITs. Turning to guidance, we are updating our AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to now be between $2.36 billion and $2.37 billion, or between $2.25 and $2.26 per diluted common share. And just as a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity, or other non-recurring transactions or items. With that, Adam, please open the line for questions. Yes, John, it's David. Good to talk to you. Those are the incremental 80 odd million is incremental draws primarily under the Great Wolf loans up in Foxwoods and then the Homefield development as well as some smaller fundings for Cabot and Canyon Ranch. So, previously announced loans that have continued draw schedules. Yes, sure. Happy to. Dan, good to speak with you. Look, when you drill into each of the partners, they have an offering that's very unique and part of the reason we partnered with them in the first place. And so, Great Wolfs is a casino without gaming. The performance continues to be solid, maybe a little bit of fall off in the weaker consumer, the lower end consumer, similar to gaming. But the drive to destination of that offering and the affordability of that offering, you can go for a day, you can go for five days, and you don't take vacations away from your kids. And so, their business continues to be strong. They've opened four assets, three assets this year with another one opening early next year up in Foxwoods. And so, the pipeline and the performance of those assets are great. And then we've talked about with Pilgrimage Golf and Cabot, the higher end consumer, the golfer is very, very avid of going out and trying new courses. Cabot does a phenomenal job of bringing in new guests and the marketing that they do for their assets and highlighting the quality of the golf experience that they're providing. And then we've talked about with you in the past around wellness and mindfulness and people's desire for longevity and better living. And so, the Canyon Ranches of the world are performing well and continue to attract customers and provide a level of service that is second to none. Go ahead, John. Yes, I think the question, Jenny, just to make sure I heard you, is about Canada, right? And we look at Canada, we look at the globe internationally. And John touched on this comment about gaming operators earlier, that there's both gaming and non-gaming opportunities across the globe. We've spoken with a lot of you about how our team has really mapped the globe and tried to focus on where we can buy real estate. And that's a function of currency markets, rule of law, tax regime. Certain countries have very, very high foreign taxes on foreign real estate ownership, so that negates some of the competitive opportunity. But specifically in Canada, we've obviously made our first foreign investment into Canada since then. We've gone into Scotland, into St. Lucia. We'd like to do both more gaming and non-gaming north of the border. And we think there's great operators up there, great economies up there, great parts of the experiential spectrum that we'd like to go into. And so we don't have anything immediate, as John would say, but hopefully there's more to come up there."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded today. August 1, 2024. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to Samantha Gallagher, General Counsel with VICI Properties. Samantha, please go ahead.\nSamantha Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Everyone should have access to the company's second quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. The release and supplemental information can be found in the Investors Section of the VICI Properties' website at www.viciproperties.com. Some of our comments today will be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by the use of words such as will, believe, expect, should, guidance, intends, outlook, projects or other similar phrases, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Therefore, you should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on them. I refer you to the company's SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact future operating results and financial conditions. During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available on our website, and our second quarter 2024 earnings release or supplemental information and filings with the SEC. For additional information with respect to non-GAAP measures of certain tenants and our counterparties discussed on this call, please refer to the respective company's public filings with the SEC. Hosting the call today, we have Ed Pitoniak, Chief Executive Officer; John Payne, President and Chief Operating Officer; David Kieske, Chief Financial Officer; Gabe Wasserman, Chief Accounting Officer; and Laurie McCluskey, Senior President of Capital Markets. Ed and team will provide some opening remarks, and then we'll open the call to questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone. As you may have figured out by now, I enjoyed putting my thoughts together for VICI's earnings call. I try to share through these opening remarks, not only what we've done, but what we're observing and learning from the marketplace. I may not always succeed in sharing anything genuinely fresh, but at the very least, I don't want my opening remarks to become repetitive. When I began putting these thoughts together in early July, the risk of repetitive remarks was high given that, until a couple of weeks ago, for REITs generally and net lease REIT specifically, not a lot had changed since last quarter's earnings call when I spoke of the big tech investing party that we REITs hadn't been invited to. In Bank of America's most recent fund manager survey, Michael Hart net showed that fund managers were underweight real estate at a level equal to and not being since the great -- the depth of the great financial crisis. Then came a welcome CPI print and REITs have begun to come back that we believe can endure. Before you hear from John and David, and before we field your questions, let me say a few words about the principles that guide us in a REIT marketplace like the ones we've been living through for a while now. We start by asking ourselves is what we're going through, whether for all REITs generally or net lease REIT specifically, cyclical or secular in nature. There are REIT sectors that have secular issues right now. Office is an obvious example of a sector with negative secular trends. Data centers is the obvious sector with positive secular trends. We strongly believe that experiential real estate is another real estate category with positive secular trends as evidenced by research recently published by McKinsey showing that indexed back to 1959, the share of consumer discretionary income spent on experiences has grown to an index level of nearly 160, while the share of consumer discretionary income spent on things has shrunk to less than 75. Capitalizing on positive secular trends is fun, addressing negative secular trends, not so much. Positive cycles for REITs are fun, negative cycles for our specific REIT sector not so much. But it's always key to remember that cycles begin and cycles end, almost always driven by factors that are beyond the control of a REIT management team and Board. In a period of lagging stock performance, driven by cyclical factors, it can be tempting for REIT management teams and boards to start deviating from the REIT's long-term goals and strategies in hopes that the deviation can somehow overcome the cycle. At VICI, we strive very hard not to deviate. Here's the strategic principle we strive to stay true to in all cycles. We dedicate ourselves to investing in experiential buildings that meet these three fundamental quality factors. Location quality, in other words, well located in markets that have sound fundamental demographics and economics. Asset quality, meaning designed and built to serve the distinct needs of experiential businesses that have high economic dynamism and economic durability. Operator quality, meaning occupied by an experiential operator that has high economic energy, ingenuity and expertise, and a strong balance sheet and credit profile. With every investment we make, we, of course, seek accretion as measured in AFFO per share. But that is not the only accretion we seek and measure. With every investment opportunity we evaluate, in addition to AFFO accretion, we ask, is a given investment opportunity accretive to asset quality. Is a given investment accretive to tenant diversity and tenant quality? Is a given investment accretive to geographic and potentially categorical diversity and quality? Finally, can it give an investment be accretive to balance sheet quality and, potentially, our credit ratings? We have not and will not grow for growth's sake, if that growth doesn't continuously improve the quality and intrinsic value of our portfolio and balance sheet. We will not, as some of our net lease peers do, tell you we spend x hundreds of millions of dollars and y percentage cap rate to generate z dollars of new rent, but then never tell you into what we invested that amount of money. We will tell you what we invest in so that you can know what you own. The very good news is that our business development team, led by John Payne, is identifying and developing opportunities to meet our broader accretion criteria. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John?\nJohn Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. We acted on the investment criteria Ed just spoke of when, in the second quarter, we made capital commitments of up to $950 million in the highly differentiated experiential buildings that have indispensable value to their occupants, namely the Venetian and a collection of Great Wolf Resorts. These are investments that live up to our quality criteria, and at the same time, the $650 million firmly committed to those investments will generate a blended investment yield of 7.9%. Our conviction that we can continue to identify and invest in experiential properties that are accretive against multiple quality factors is a key reason that we have decided that we will not be exercising our call right to acquire Harrah\u2019s Hoosier Park in Horseshoe, Indianapolis. We can and are making this decision because of our confidence and conviction that we are actively identifying and pursuing investment opportunities that enable us to generate future AFFO growth and accretion, while furthering the strength and diversity of our portfolio and tenant roster. At this time, we believe that we have the opportunity to create greater portfolio value by allocating VICI's capital to other gaming and nongaming opportunities the team is actively pursuing. This is an approach that we believe will produce 2024 AFFO [Indiscernible], bit higher in our net lease category. And with our newly [Indiscernible], we're in 2024 growth 2% at the midpoint is nearly 3 times the 2024 AFFO per growth rate guided into last week by our one gaming REIT peer. The factor that continues to accrue to our overall portfolio quality and structured tenant credit is the success of the dynamic city of Las Vegas, where VICI collects 45% of our rent from assets that we own. Over the years, I've cited on record-breaking [Indiscernible] in the first half of 2024. Harry Read International Airport had back-to-back record months reporting 5.1 million passengers arriving and parting in June. June was the third best month ever. Trailing May, the second best month ever. And October of 2023 was the best month ever. In May, international visitation of Vegas also jumped 23% year-over-year. And in June, it was reported that city officials are contemplating adding a second airport to Las Vegas, with executives from Southwest Airlines stating and I quote, \"It feels like any flight we add in a Vegas gets filled. It's almost this insatiable appetite for people wanting to come and see Vegas.\" Our Las Vegas tenants continue to benefit from this momentum as evidenced by our up to $700 million capital investment to fund extensive reinvestment projects at the Venetian in exchange for increased rent. The size and the success of our gaming properties allows us a unique opportunity to put large dollars to work into assets we already own. There continues to be a variety of opportunities on the horizon [Indiscernible] to the growth of our portfolio. Casino gaming assets continue to present the largest opportunity, both domestically and internationally, inclusive of investment opportunities into the casino resort properties we already own. The magnitude and consistency of gaming cash flows and the creativity of our gaming tenants continue to drive conviction in this section, and have set the blueprint REIT to extend our TAM and other experiential sectors. I now will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David?\nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. Based on balance sheet, liquidity, results and our updated full year guidance, which we are very excited about. As we work on the right side of the balance sheet, we are constantly focusing on VICI's balance sheet quality, bringing our leverage further down within our range of 5 times to 5.5 times, diligently working with the rating agencies to improve our credit ratings over time and ultimately lowering our cost of capital, balancing the right long-term leverage for the company, all while ensuring we have the dry powder to continue to fund accretive growth for our owners. In terms of dry powder, as of today, we have approximately $3.2 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $347 million in cash and cash equivalents, $566 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding cohorts and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold 4 million shares and received approximately $115 million under our forward sale agreements. These proceeds were used to partially fund the Venetian capital investment John mentioned earlier. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized second quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled foreign equity is approximately 4.4 times -- excuse me, 5.4 times, within our target leverage range of 5 times to 5.5 times. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%, taking into counter hedge portfolio at a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 5.9% compared to $0.54 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. We are very proud to deliver this continued consistent growth to our owners. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items, and we have the highest net income margin in the S&P 500 as noted in an article published by Barron's during the month of July. Our G&A was $15.8 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues, it was only 1.6%. This continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple-net sector, but across all REITs. Turning to guidance. We are raising our AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024, is expected to now be between $2.35 billion and $2.37 billion, or between $2.24 and $2.26 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance range, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4.7%. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. And as we have mentioned in the past, we reported noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis which was its inherent unpredictability leaves us enable forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of productivity on our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Well, thanks for the update on the plans to not execute options that you have this year. I guess just as you think bigger picture, on deals you might do going forward and the options that you might create, does the way that this one ended up kind of working out or turning out, and your decision-making process have any impact on, I guess, how you structure options in the future, what the details might be, how far in advance they are? Anything like that.\nEd Pitoniak: John or David, do you want to take a first crack at that in terms of how we think about options going forward?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it's a very good question. I do think it's important. I heard my comments were broken also a little bit. But it is important to understand that this was a strategic decision really based on capital allocation and portfolio management at this time. We have great conviction with opportunities that are in front of us that will further our tenant and geographical and category diversity. And as we continue to look at opportunities and we negotiate put calls or renegotiate [Indiscernible], we'll think about the length of those and the appropriate times of those. Again, it's important to understand that we have great conviction to continue to grow the business around the world.\nCaitlin Burrows: And just as a follow-up on that geographic diversity point, I noticed the prepared remarks also mentioned international potential opportunities. So just wondering if you comment further on kind of what sort of international opportunities for this side type of you think could come up over the medium term or where?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes. Another good question. We have been busy traveling, not only domestically, but internationally. And I think on other calls, we've talked about countries that we've been studying. We've spent some time in Australia, in New Zealand. We've spent some time in Europe and the U.K. and other parts of the world where it makes sense and our capital can work. I don't have anything to announce now obviously, but we see opportunities to continue to diversify not only in location, but with new tenants as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.\nBarry Jonas: As you look at that international opportunity set, just curious how that's split between gaming and non-gaming?\nEd Pitoniak: John, do you want to take that once again?\nJohn Payne: It seems like I am answering the first three questions today, Barry, but it's all good. I'm not sure we'll have the exact percentage of what's going to come in gaming and non-gaming. But I think you can imagine when we travel around the world, we spend time in countries with legalized gaming and understanding the real estate of those assets, while at the same time meeting with experiential operators. In my remarks, and I've said this for the past 7 years, the greatest opportunity we see is still in casino gaming, both domestically and internationally. But we do spend time with operators in both the experiential sectors in gaming when we travel around the world.\nEd Pitoniak: And Barry, I'll just add that -- Barry, I'll just add that pretty much by definition and by logic, the dollar percentage will always tend -- whether domestically or internationally, the dollar percentage will very much favor gaming investment given the magnitude of the assets and the capital required to acquire them.\nBarry Jonas: And then just as a follow-up, seriously how you're thinking about your strip land and just development these days. You obviously owned several acres on the strip and office strip, and then your -tenant caesars is now talking about maybe selling some noncore assets, which I presume include land.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. So Barry we -- as John talked about in his opening remarks, we are just great believers in the Las Vegas ecosystem, which is obviously got ganing at its center. But as we see with really almost each passing quarter, the amount of innovation that's going on in terms of the broadening and deepening of Las Vegas experiences truly makes it like no other place on earth. We obviously have a lot of exposure to Las Vegas right now as a percentage of our annual base rent. But we would -- we are and we will be very comfortable and continuing to invest incremental capital, much the way we did with the Venetian investment in Las Vegas, because it is, is truly one of a kind destination in the world. And that has implications, obviously, for putting incremental money into the assets we already own, with the Venetian, with our Caesar asset, and especially, obviously, given magnitude of MGM assets we own, particularly at the South end of the strip that's seeing more and more demand drivers. And then in addition to that, as you alluded to, we do have a vacant land that, over the coming years and decades, obviously represents further potential to invest capital and broaden and deepen our exposure to Las Vegas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird.\nWes Golladay: I know you target full cycle investments with high-quality partners, but there has been some pockets of weakness in the consumer. Has this led you to change how you're looking at the current acquisition pipeline?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. It's a very good question, Wes. And obviously, whether it's the McDonald's earnings report or other earnings reports, you are starting to hear about weakness, especially in the lower end consumer. And even recently, there's been some talk among gaming operators about seeing some weakness on -- at the lower end in the regionals. I would not say at this point it's yet affected how we are thinking about our investments going forward. We focusing on the categories of experiences that we do, focusing generally on middle to higher end, it hasn't caused concern for us yet. Especially when, of course, you take in the existential fact that we as a net lease asset owner are not exposed to the variability quarter-by-quarter in consumer spending.\nWes Golladay: And then you do have a highly predictable business model, but you have the Caesars lease coming up in November. It does have a variable component. That's a little bit harder to model. Could you maybe put some goalposts on that, how we should think of that?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Wes. It is a good question. We're entering lease year 8 with Caesars. Hard to believe it's -- we're getting the lease year 8. So it seems like yesterday we started this company. But November 1 will be the start of that year and there does -- start of that lease year and there does become a variable component and a base component. And we are -- the way that the calculation runs for the Vegas lease, 80% is based, 20% is variable for the regional lease, it's 70% based and 30% variable. It's based on a comparison of net revenues for years 5 through 7 versus year 0 through 1. We are still collecting the data of Caesars because the calculation period actually runs through September of 2024. But based on what we're seeing, it should be relatively neutral to no impact to our escalation in November 1, 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John DeCree from CBRE?\nJohn DeCree: Maybe one on your decision today to say that you're not going to move forward with Centaur. So I thought you may have had until the end of the year to make a decision, and so we certainly can appreciate being decisive and looking at your pipeline. But curious if you could talk a little bit about why make that announcement today with still maybe several months ahead to consider that?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. No, it's a very, very good question, John. The reason we decided to announce this today is that the strategic factors that went into making our decision are of a nature that they were not going to change over the ensuing, whatever it is now left in the year, 5 months of the year. And so in fairness, obviously, to our partners at Caesars, but also recognizing our need to always be as ruthlessly efficient as we can be with return on management time, we decided -- again, because the strategic decision factors will not change in the next 5 months, decided to announce it today. So that everyone can understand, our team can understand, Caesars can understand, you all can understand that we will not be calling it, and none of us have to spend time wondering if and when wee might between now and the very end at the end of the year.\nJohn DeCree: And that's probably but the last question from us get us on Centaur, although there's been many over the last 8 months or so. So I appreciate that. Maybe bigger picture, in terms of underwriting gaming assets today, so a lot has happened. We've talked about some of consumer trends. We've looked at where some recent deals have gone out. And just kind of curious if your -- any updated thoughts on how you think about full 4-wall coverage kind of cap rates in the gaming space now. There's a little bit more strict in how you think about 4-wall coverage and kind of where you think cap rates are going. And I know kind of every asset and transaction is a little different, but just high level, would be good to kind of get any kind of thinking on broad strokes.\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. Yes. So I think our starting point, John, is that we always want our capital investments to pass the test of if this was our last dollar capital, would this be the highest and best use of that capital. And as we have engaged in the continuous learning given at the heart of our creation of VICI is both a company and a culture, I think very much to the point of the question you're asking, we continue to refine our thinking on what will drive the strongest, continuous improvement in our access to and our cost of capital. And that really guides our decision-making in many different forms, including, obviously, tenant diversity, geographic diversity, tenant credit quality, strength of tenant balance sheet and, very much to your point, rent coverage. So as we look at that, that mosaic factors, we -- again, we feel very good about the discipline we've developed around capital allocation. And the degree to which it can, again, just to stress the point, lead ultimately to strongest comparative cost of capital advantage over the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi.\nNick Joseph: Maybe just following up on the [Indiscernible] question. Is this deal fully bedded? And I guess would -- is there any chance that the assets are put to you? Or is that all put to that as well?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: The way the contract reads, you are correct, that the assets could be put to us. But Tom Reeg at Caesars, I think, has been very vocal about this, at least over the past year, that they had no plans to put these two assets to us. But the contract does last until the end of the year, as we spoke about earlier today.\nNick Joseph: And then just as we look to November, I'm just curious if there's any legislative issues on any ballots that you're watching that could be important for regional gaming.\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: We all take that -- yes, I'll take that, Ed. We continue to look not only, I think you mentioned regional gaming, but I think we're looking all over the world where there are changes happening to the good, and I guess it could be to the bad, but where are there going to be opportunities to deploy capital with new tenants and new locations, possibly in new categories. And there are some places around the world that are going through quite a bit of change that we're better understanding. We'll continue to watch opportunities in the United States as well. Every year, I think you know the state of Texas and the state of Georgia, state of Kentucky often come out with some form of gaming. And then obviously, with online sports betting, which is spread across the United States, there will be other states that think about that. And usually, in some deals, they talk about the bricks-and-mortar casinos. So not specifically, but we stay in touch to see if there ultimately will be some opportunities for us to invest. And then I'll finally say, we continue to monitor New York, where that process continues to proceed into 2025. And we'll have a better understanding when 3 licenses will be awarded and to whom they are awarded.\nEd Pitoniak: Nick, I would just add that -- Nick, I'll just add that we obviously do monitor continuous -- continuing legislative change and, in many cases, the associated emergence of new supply across American regional gaming. And I do think we obviously need to take care, as capital allocators, that as we allocate capital into regional gaming assets, which we will continue to do. They were doing so aware of the supply-demand trends on a mark-to-market basis. Because in regional gaming, catchment areas for regional gaming, obviously tend to be more confined than we would find in Las Vegas, because the catchment area for Las Vegas is global. As John said in his opening remarks, international travel to Vegas has rebounded stronger than any place else in the U.S., probably one of the strongest international travel rebounds around the world. And so while new supply will come to Las Vegas, it will come into a market whose catchment area, again, is global. And we obviously need to be mindful in regional areas that the catchment areas are somewhat infinite, and we need to weigh our capital allocation decisions based upon supply/demand trends on a highly localized basis.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.\nRavi Vaidya: This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. Just had a couple of quick follow-ups here on the Indiana assets. Was the cap rate not attractive enough in the current rate environment? And did the emergence of Bala Chicago coming up the next 5 years' payroll as it could possibly impact casino operations throughout the midwest?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I'll let John take the second part of that. On the first part, the cap rate is perfectly fine cap rate. As we look across our array of investment opportunities and as we contemplated potentially investing more than $2 billion of capital or close to 5% of our total capital, we, again, wanted to be relentless in our scrutiny as what would this be the highest and best use of our capital both on a cap rate basis and the associated accretion, but also on the key, if you will, nonfinancial accretion factors of tenant diversity, geographic diversity and those secondary factors. So the cap rate by itself was not the gaining issue. And then I will turn it over to John for his thoughts on midwestern gaming.\nJohn Payne: Yes. The question about will the facility that ultimately is built in downtown Chicago will impact the Indianapolis to casinos, the answer is now on that. To Ed's comments earlier about where consumers go to regional gaming and how far do they drive, the Indianapolis market is considerably far away from downtown Chicago. In fact, there's many other casinos between Indianapolis and Chicago that consumers can choose from as well. So that was not a factor in our decision to not call the to Indianapolis asset.\nRavi Vaidya: How large do you forecast the experiential credit solution strategy to become? And we noticed you have a couple of deals with Great Wolf here over the years, how important is that as a defense and entertainment option in this recessionary environment?\nEd Pitoniak: David, do you want to take the first part of that?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Thanks, Ravi. Roughly, our credit book today is $2.2 billion, it's 4% to 5% of total assets, and we feel good in and around that area. We developed a credit book as a way to broaden our means and to expand our relationships. And you've heard us talk about, at the end of the day, our capital is relationship capital. And the credit book allows us to develop new partnerships, develop new relationships, ultimately through some of the deals that have call options at our discretion. But along the way, we learn about new segments and new businesses, and we've learned things that ultimately we may not like, we -- our loan gets repaid and we move on. But if we learn things we like, we continue to want to grow in those areas through either real estate ownership or deepening the existing relationships. So it's been a very, very effective tool and it's been something we're excited about, and something that we continue to use in our toolkit as we expand both domestically and internationally.\nEd Pitoniak: And Ravi, could you repeat the second half of that question?\nRavi Vaidya: Sure. We've had a couple of deals with the Great Wolf over the years, I just wanted to hear your comments on how this is particularly defensive and important entertainment source as we go into a recessionary environment here where the consumer is stretched?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. David, do you want to talk about what we have seen historically on Great Wolf's durability through all cycles?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. In the broader indoor water park sector or, broadly, Gabe Wasserman is in the room here and he did our first white paper back in '18 when we started looking at indoor water parks and the economic vitality of these businesses. When the original Great Wolf went public back in '04, '05, it was Thursday through Sunday, Thursday through Monday business. Now it's a 7-day a week business. And we call them casinos without gaming, because of the economic leverage they have and the multiple cash registers they have, both with the water park, the family entertainment center, the food and beverage, the lodging. And as an example, Perryville opened just earlier this year -- last year. And within 3 months, it was exceeding its initial underwriting and ultimately went into the broader refi package. So these things open, they open quick and they open producing a lot of cash flow. So we're excited about that. And hopefully, there's an opportunity someday to own the real estate of some of these indoor water park businesses.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: So a little bit of a different -- great, a little bit of a different kind of question for John, which is through our window past couple of days, we've seen a pretty consistent outlook shift to something more moderate or even down, specifically around leisure transient activities across hospitality. And not that it will impact your earnings stream imminently, but John, I assume in your travels, you have a finger on that pulse as well. I just would love a little bit of insight from what you're seeing and hearing through your window, please?\nJohn Payne: Yes, David. Nice to talk to you. And hopefully, I'll see you on the road while I'm traveling. Look, you are correct. We're hearing in some businesses some softness and hearing about the consumer, and Ed touched on this earlier in his comments, particularly around the lower-end consumer. I was telling my colleague, David, a story about I was in Scotland recently. And every person I met talked about visiting United States. And guess what city -- if they were only going 2 to 3 cities, they said they would have to go to, it was Las Vegas. And what's become so interesting traveling the world is that 10 years ago, that wouldn't have been the answer, right? Everyone has said, I flying to New York. When I hit Chicago, I'm going to go on to San Francisco and the West Coast, and you probably wouldn't hear about Las Vegas. The beauty about what our tenants have done is diversifying the reasons to come to Las Vegas. And no matter what sector, whether you're in the high-end sector that comes by private jet, or where you're a sector that, like myself, travels by Southwest Airlines, they continue to attract different folks to that city. So I'm not giving you a macro answer about the whole world of the United States, I'm giving you an answer about where we look to put our money and where our money is right now, and that's why we're so bullish on Las Vegas. As we study other sectors, as we study other parts of the world, we will definitely make sure we understand what the consumer is doing up and down with spending tree. But I will tell you, in my travels, I'm excited about where we have our money and continue to put money in because that people are traveling to that destination of Las Vegas.\nEd Pitoniak: And that -- operator, before we go to the next question, I'd just like to add to David Katz's question. In a time like this, where we could be potentially looking at a period of economic volatility as measured in consumer spending, it really highlights the value of dividend-paying stocks when it comes to reducing the volatility of the equity versus the volatility of the consumer economy. And that is why, again, we're so careful in what we investing because we want to make sure we're investing in assets and partner relationships that we believe very strongly can endure up and down cycles in consumer spending. We do not go seeking C guard but real estate, to use the old Benjamin Graham term. We are seeking real estate that we know can endure a cycle and cycle out and has positive secular trends, such that we can feel very confident in our ability to continually pay a dividend and steadily grow the dividend ideally at a rate that is equal to or exceed inflation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Herring from Green Street.\nMichael Herring: My question on balance sheet. Your [Indiscernible] $2 billion in notes coming due in the first half of next year. How did that factor into the decision to not exercise those call rights, particularly as you look to potentially reduce your leverage and earn a better investment-grade rating?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. I'll turn it over to David in a moment, Michael. But I would say it really factored in, virtually not at all. And not that we're not mindful of the obligation we have to refinance as effectively as we can in the coming year. But we, again, made the decision we made on those call rights because of how compelling our other investment opportunities are, which you should be hearing about in due course. And so that was not a constraining factor. And Dave, I don't know if you want to add anything in terms of how we're thinking about leverage and the ratings curve.\nDavid Kieske: Yes. No, you touched on it, Ed. It's portfolio management around not exercising the book call. Michael, in terms of the balance sheet, we've got 3 maturities next year, February, May and June. And as you saw us actively and very successfully refi our 2024 maturity with a well, well, well oversubscribed refinancing that we did back in March, we're working and planning towards refi those maturities that, again, come due first part -- in the first quarter and then in late second quarter of '25. And then you saw our peer, GLPI, had a very, very successful refi or a debt offering 2 days ago. And being investment-grade rated, having a very deep liquid investment-grade credit profile accrues to our benefit. And we're -- we feel very good about our ability to refi those maturities and continue to extend and ladder our maturity profile. And ultimately, over time, my data the BBB curve, lowering our cost of capital being able to continue to compete for asset acquisitions across the globe.\nMichael Herring: Maybe just one more, switching gears a little bit. As there's been some M&A chatter on the operator side, can you just speak broadly -- maybe this is more for John on just the practical protection that VICI has on its master leases in the event there is a change of control on the operator side.\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it's a very good question, Michael. It's a hard one to answer simply because we have -- we used to be a company when we started that had 1 or 2 leases, now we've got over double digits. But in all our leases, we do have protection. Samantha Gallagher, our General Counsel is on the line, that could add to that. But we feel good. We're staying in touch with our operators to better understand what's going on in the market. I think you used the word chatter, I think that's probably the best word out there right now. But we do have protection in our many leases that we have. Sam, I don't know if you would like to add anything to the question?\nSamantha Gallagher: Yes, John, you did a great job. I think just to John's point, while we do have a number of different leases, all of our leases are mined. What happens in a change of control and have strong protections to ensure. And just as a reminder, we have gone through a change of control with one of our tenants already, where -- we see the Caesars Eldorado merger. So we feel very comfortable with how our leases are structured to address any change and control.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Kammert from Evercore.\nJim Kammert: David, was there anything in particular that led you to bump the guidance at this point? I mean the acquisition investing activity has been well disclosed and you don't include prospective activity and guidance. So I was just curious there are 1 or 2 factors that motivated to do it at this time?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: I mean, Jim, you touched on that. I think when we lapped our first quarter earnings call, the thing -- the funding timing and some of the -- how we were going to fund some of the announcements that we had previously made weren't finalized. And so as we talked about in our guidance, we don't project any unknown capital markets activities or any unidentified or unknown activities. So those announcements plus the continued funding through our loan book has led us to feel very confident about the increase in guidance and feel very good about achieving that guidance. And a lot of it came from the Great Wolf impact, which closed slightly after our earnings.\nJim Kammert: And then the second question, please. Ed, you almost get -- I've obviously enthused about you said your alternatives to invest capital other than the Caesar option properties. Obviously not going to give us a whole lot of color, but are they -- these future opportunities, is this a ramp in the tools of bucket or opportunity set in dollar value in your mind? What would the split maybe be between further credit book or more fee interest?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes. It will very much predominantly be fee interested, Jim. And I think one thing you can expect is that as we continue to allocate capital it will be on a cadence that is not necessarily as heavily weighted to one single investment, as would have been the case with the Indiana assets. Again, that -- just to reiterate, that would have been almost 5% of capital into one deal. And I do think as a REIT from both a return and a risk management point of view, we will always be very happy to achieve a sustained and sustainable capital allocation cadence, which, again, will be principally in gaming and principally fee over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kilichowski from Wells Fargo.\nJohn Kilichowski: Kind of going back to the embedded growth pipe, maybe if we can jump down to the experiential side following the comments of Heros and Caesars. I'm just curious, and I know that these are a little less pressing in terms of time line, but how are you thinking about the call options for Canyon Ranch and Cabot and home field to market retail?\nEd Pitoniak: Yes, John, I'm happy to start with that. And before I do, I just wanted to add one last comment to the last question that Jim Kammert asked. And that has to do with not only a sustained and sustainable capital allocation cadence, that lends itself to a more sustained and sustainable funding cadence as opposed to the need to draw a whole lot of funding at one time for one deal. Anyway, to go on to your question about Cabot, Canyon Ranch and the others, we obviously -- we're talking here about assets that are under development or otherwise ramping. So we will obviously take the time we need and the time the operator needs to get the assets to where they can best sustain the opco/propco model, none of which at this point are immediately imminent. We were very excited about, obviously, what Cabot is doing in Cabot Citrus Farms. They have really created some session there. And I think, Samantha, we're pretty confident in saying that we look forward to the day when we can exercise our call right at Cabot Citrus Farms. But in the meantime, Samantha, do you want to add any color to what we're seeing in terms of mind share and market share.\nSamantha Gallagher: Yes -- no, thanks, Ed. Just as some may know, when we follow and we talk about the Cabot relationship, they continue to expand their global portfolio. We're excited about that and we're excited about our opportunities in the future to exercise our call rights. No changes in our commitment there.\nJohn Kilichowski: And then maybe just jumping quickly to your guidance. And there was a sentence there that reflects the dilutive effect of the roughly 90 million shares, under your for sale agreements. Just wondering what the -- like the impact of that dilutive effect for the rest of the year?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes, John, it's David. Yes, it's very minimal. If we've got to account for the forwards under the treasury stock dilution method, and it's a very, very minimal impact to the share count that shows up in our guidance range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from R.J. Milligan from Raymond James.\nR.J. Milligan: I think John was probably a little early calling the last question on Centaur. I just have one follow-up. There was some overhang on the stock given the uncertainty, the Centaur assets. And I'm curious how much of an impact that had on your decision to announce today that you wouldn't be calling the assets? I'm just curious if we can interpret that as doing other opportunities between now and the end of the year that you may pursue and don't want this overhang on your cost of equity?\nEd Pitoniak: R.J., Good to hear be from you. That was not a deciding factor by any means. Obviously, we are aware, we're aware of the perception of overhang on the stock, and that was obviously -- it felt like a more significant factor through much of Q2 and even into the first couple of weeks of Q3 given the general state of the REIT equity market. But no, that wasn't a deciding factor and are deciding to announce it now. Again, the real driving factor was just to make sure everybody understood we've made a decision. And we're comfortable -- very comfortable announcing the decision. Very comfortable that we have very compelling other opportunities to allocate capital. And again, I would just go back to the point of our desire -- and we won't achieve it every time, but our desired capital allocation and capital funding strategies are based on being sustained and sustainable. We obviously spent a good number of our early years doing very big deals that had very big funding requirements, that generally needed to happen all in one day. And as VICI matures and as we achieve a sustained and sustainable cadence in AFFO growth, we want that to be driven by a sustained and sustainable cadence in both capital allocation activity, i.e., acquisitions and funding.\nR.J. Milligan: Should we interpret that funding comment as you're likely to be a bigger user of the ATM going forward versus overnights?\nEd Pitoniak: I'll turn that over to David. But before I do, we obviously want to take care that the market never develops VICI ATM fatigue. And with that, I'll turn it over to David for any further color he wants to add.\nDavid Kieske: No. Ed, you stole my line. That's exactly right. You've heard us say, under Mo\u2019's leadership, we have a balanced approach to raising equity, whether that be an ATM, blocks, overnights, smart deals in connection with larger transactions. So we want to ensure that we raise capital the most efficiently, but also ensure that we are not developing or becoming stale in our style and then developing fatigue out there with our owners.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Guglielmo from Capital One Securities.\nDan Guglielmo: Just one from me on the credit solution investments. Most of the recent growth has been in the mezz and preferred investments, which do historically carry more risk. How are you all monitoring those investments? And could you pull future funding commitments if the macro economy does get choppy?\nEd Pitoniak: David?\nDavid Kieske: Yes. Gabe is the envy of the VICI experiential credit solutions. He's here in the room, our Chief Accounting Officer. So for this Credit Solutions head on and answer that.\nGabe Wasserman: Dan, thanks for the question. So we're very and thoughtful with our underwriting. Even though those certain investments are structured as mezz and preferred equity, we're very thoughtful about where our attachment point is and our last dollar. Looking at the operating history of the property kind of future underwriting projections and strength and sophistication of the sponsor, so that all goes into our underwriting. We have quarterly investment loan reviews, where we're working at the property performance and discuss it as a management team. And then in terms of contractual rights, if there's something that went sideways in the macro economy, generally, that wouldn't allow us to have funding. But we certainly have protections under all of our loan agreements, that the borrowers have to meet certain conditions precedent in order for us to fund.\nEd Pitoniak: And Dan -- Dan, this is Ed. I would just add that we are always lending against experiential assets, that, in a worst-case scenario, would meet our strategic investment criteria. If again, in the worst case, the asset ever came into our hands, we would want -- we always want these to be assets that, in the worst case, we would be willing to own.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: You guys a few times have highlighted the strength in Las Vegas, some of the stats in terms of visitation, which is obviously being driven by the casino assets, but also the growth in sports and entertainment that we've seen out there, that gets a lot of people who don't visit the casino to still come to the city. So with that in mind, you obviously benefit from the visitation. But has anything changed in terms of you looking to do deals with some of those live entertainment, concert event stadium types of businesses? And how do you think about the durability and pricing of that sector?\nEd Pitoniak: John?\nJohn Payne: Yes, it's a great question, Chad. And I think you've heard us over the years talk about the sectors that we're looking at. And obviously, we've made investments in Pilgrim's Golf, indoor water parks, wellness sports. I think you're asking us a question about would we make an investment in the live entertainment, real estate and facilities. I know you're asking that question about Las Vegas, but would we also -- I think filters out into the rest of the United States. It is a sector that we have been spending some time and better understanding. We love what has happened in the city of Las Vegas with the growth of sports and entertainment. We're better understanding the economics of what happens inside those big buildings. They're absolutely beautiful and the shows are great, but can they support our model. And we're continuing to study that. And could there be an investment over time? There could be. But we want to make sure that the cash flows are durable and that the operator is a tenant that we want to be partners with for a long time. But it sure is exciting how Las Vegas has diversified its revenue stream and attracting new consumers by adding sports and entertainment, not just gambling and food and nightlife.\nOperator: And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand over to Edward Pitoniak for any final remarks.\nEd Pitoniak: Thank you, Carla. And we'll just thank all of you for your time on today's call. And wish you, once earnings season is over, an enjoyable rest of the summer. Bye for now.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ed Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha. Good morning, everyone. As you may have figured out by now, I enjoyed putting my thoughts together for VICI's earnings call. I try to share through these opening remarks, not only what we've done, but what we're observing and learning from the marketplace. I may not always succeed in sharing anything genuinely fresh, but at the very least, I don't want my opening remarks to become repetitive. When I began putting these thoughts together in early July, the risk of repetitive remarks was high given that, until a couple of weeks ago, for REITs generally and net lease REIT specifically, not a lot had changed since last quarter's earnings call when I spoke of the big tech investing party that we REITs hadn't been invited to. In Bank of America's most recent fund manager survey, Michael Hart net showed that fund managers were underweight real estate at a level equal to and not being since the great -- the depth of the great financial crisis. Then came a welcome CPI print and REITs have begun to come back that we believe can endure. Before you hear from John and David, and before we field your questions, let me say a few words about the principles that guide us in a REIT marketplace like the ones we've been living through for a while now. We start by asking ourselves is what we're going through, whether for all REITs generally or net lease REIT specifically, cyclical or secular in nature. There are REIT sectors that have secular issues right now. Office is an obvious example of a sector with negative secular trends. Data centers is the obvious sector with positive secular trends. We strongly believe that experiential real estate is another real estate category with positive secular trends as evidenced by research recently published by McKinsey showing that indexed back to 1959, the share of consumer discretionary income spent on experiences has grown to an index level of nearly 160, while the share of consumer discretionary income spent on things has shrunk to less than 75. Capitalizing on positive secular trends is fun, addressing negative secular trends, not so much. Positive cycles for REITs are fun, negative cycles for our specific REIT sector not so much. But it's always key to remember that cycles begin and cycles end, almost always driven by factors that are beyond the control of a REIT management team and Board. In a period of lagging stock performance, driven by cyclical factors, it can be tempting for REIT management teams and boards to start deviating from the REIT's long-term goals and strategies in hopes that the deviation can somehow overcome the cycle. At VICI, we strive very hard not to deviate. Here's the strategic principle we strive to stay true to in all cycles. We dedicate ourselves to investing in experiential buildings that meet these three fundamental quality factors. Location quality, in other words, well located in markets that have sound fundamental demographics and economics. Asset quality, meaning designed and built to serve the distinct needs of experiential businesses that have high economic dynamism and economic durability. Operator quality, meaning occupied by an experiential operator that has high economic energy, ingenuity and expertise, and a strong balance sheet and credit profile. With every investment we make, we, of course, seek accretion as measured in AFFO per share. But that is not the only accretion we seek and measure. With every investment opportunity we evaluate, in addition to AFFO accretion, we ask, is a given investment opportunity accretive to asset quality. Is a given investment accretive to tenant diversity and tenant quality? Is a given investment accretive to geographic and potentially categorical diversity and quality? Finally, can it give an investment be accretive to balance sheet quality and, potentially, our credit ratings? We have not and will not grow for growth's sake, if that growth doesn't continuously improve the quality and intrinsic value of our portfolio and balance sheet. We will not, as some of our net lease peers do, tell you we spend x hundreds of millions of dollars and y percentage cap rate to generate z dollars of new rent, but then never tell you into what we invested that amount of money. We will tell you what we invest in so that you can know what you own. The very good news is that our business development team, led by John Payne, is identifying and developing opportunities to meet our broader accretion criteria. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. John? John or David, do you want to take a first crack at that in terms of how we think about options going forward? John? John, do you want to take that once again? And Barry, I'll just add that -- Barry, I'll just add that pretty much by definition and by logic, the dollar percentage will always tend -- whether domestically or internationally, the dollar percentage will very much favor gaming investment given the magnitude of the assets and the capital required to acquire them. Yes. So Barry we -- as John talked about in his opening remarks, we are just great believers in the Las Vegas ecosystem, which is obviously got ganing at its center. But as we see with really almost each passing quarter, the amount of innovation that's going on in terms of the broadening and deepening of Las Vegas experiences truly makes it like no other place on earth. We obviously have a lot of exposure to Las Vegas right now as a percentage of our annual base rent. But we would -- we are and we will be very comfortable and continuing to invest incremental capital, much the way we did with the Venetian investment in Las Vegas, because it is, is truly one of a kind destination in the world. And that has implications, obviously, for putting incremental money into the assets we already own, with the Venetian, with our Caesar asset, and especially, obviously, given magnitude of MGM assets we own, particularly at the South end of the strip that's seeing more and more demand drivers. And then in addition to that, as you alluded to, we do have a vacant land that, over the coming years and decades, obviously represents further potential to invest capital and broaden and deepen our exposure to Las Vegas. Yes. It's a very good question, Wes. And obviously, whether it's the McDonald's earnings report or other earnings reports, you are starting to hear about weakness, especially in the lower end consumer. And even recently, there's been some talk among gaming operators about seeing some weakness on -- at the lower end in the regionals. I would not say at this point it's yet affected how we are thinking about our investments going forward. We focusing on the categories of experiences that we do, focusing generally on middle to higher end, it hasn't caused concern for us yet. Especially when, of course, you take in the existential fact that we as a net lease asset owner are not exposed to the variability quarter-by-quarter in consumer spending. David? Yes. No, it's a very, very good question, John. The reason we decided to announce this today is that the strategic factors that went into making our decision are of a nature that they were not going to change over the ensuing, whatever it is now left in the year, 5 months of the year. And so in fairness, obviously, to our partners at Caesars, but also recognizing our need to always be as ruthlessly efficient as we can be with return on management time, we decided -- again, because the strategic decision factors will not change in the next 5 months, decided to announce it today. So that everyone can understand, our team can understand, Caesars can understand, you all can understand that we will not be calling it, and none of us have to spend time wondering if and when wee might between now and the very end at the end of the year. Yes. Yes. So I think our starting point, John, is that we always want our capital investments to pass the test of if this was our last dollar capital, would this be the highest and best use of that capital. And as we have engaged in the continuous learning given at the heart of our creation of VICI is both a company and a culture, I think very much to the point of the question you're asking, we continue to refine our thinking on what will drive the strongest, continuous improvement in our access to and our cost of capital. And that really guides our decision-making in many different forms, including, obviously, tenant diversity, geographic diversity, tenant credit quality, strength of tenant balance sheet and, very much to your point, rent coverage. So as we look at that, that mosaic factors, we -- again, we feel very good about the discipline we've developed around capital allocation. And the degree to which it can, again, just to stress the point, lead ultimately to strongest comparative cost of capital advantage over the long term. John? John? Nick, I would just add that -- Nick, I'll just add that we obviously do monitor continuous -- continuing legislative change and, in many cases, the associated emergence of new supply across American regional gaming. And I do think we obviously need to take care, as capital allocators, that as we allocate capital into regional gaming assets, which we will continue to do. They were doing so aware of the supply-demand trends on a mark-to-market basis. Because in regional gaming, catchment areas for regional gaming, obviously tend to be more confined than we would find in Las Vegas, because the catchment area for Las Vegas is global. As John said in his opening remarks, international travel to Vegas has rebounded stronger than any place else in the U.S., probably one of the strongest international travel rebounds around the world. And so while new supply will come to Las Vegas, it will come into a market whose catchment area, again, is global. And we obviously need to be mindful in regional areas that the catchment areas are somewhat infinite, and we need to weigh our capital allocation decisions based upon supply/demand trends on a highly localized basis. Yes. I'll let John take the second part of that. On the first part, the cap rate is perfectly fine cap rate. As we look across our array of investment opportunities and as we contemplated potentially investing more than $2 billion of capital or close to 5% of our total capital, we, again, wanted to be relentless in our scrutiny as what would this be the highest and best use of our capital both on a cap rate basis and the associated accretion, but also on the key, if you will, nonfinancial accretion factors of tenant diversity, geographic diversity and those secondary factors. So the cap rate by itself was not the gaining issue. And then I will turn it over to John for his thoughts on midwestern gaming. David, do you want to take the first part of that? And Ravi, could you repeat the second half of that question? Yes. David, do you want to talk about what we have seen historically on Great Wolf's durability through all cycles? And that -- operator, before we go to the next question, I'd just like to add to David Katz's question. In a time like this, where we could be potentially looking at a period of economic volatility as measured in consumer spending, it really highlights the value of dividend-paying stocks when it comes to reducing the volatility of the equity versus the volatility of the consumer economy. And that is why, again, we're so careful in what we investing because we want to make sure we're investing in assets and partner relationships that we believe very strongly can endure up and down cycles in consumer spending. We do not go seeking C guard but real estate, to use the old Benjamin Graham term. We are seeking real estate that we know can endure a cycle and cycle out and has positive secular trends, such that we can feel very confident in our ability to continually pay a dividend and steadily grow the dividend ideally at a rate that is equal to or exceed inflation. Yes. I'll turn it over to David in a moment, Michael. But I would say it really factored in, virtually not at all. And not that we're not mindful of the obligation we have to refinance as effectively as we can in the coming year. But we, again, made the decision we made on those call rights because of how compelling our other investment opportunities are, which you should be hearing about in due course. And so that was not a constraining factor. And Dave, I don't know if you want to add anything in terms of how we're thinking about leverage and the ratings curve. John? David? Yes. It will very much predominantly be fee interested, Jim. And I think one thing you can expect is that as we continue to allocate capital it will be on a cadence that is not necessarily as heavily weighted to one single investment, as would have been the case with the Indiana assets. Again, that -- just to reiterate, that would have been almost 5% of capital into one deal. And I do think as a REIT from both a return and a risk management point of view, we will always be very happy to achieve a sustained and sustainable capital allocation cadence, which, again, will be principally in gaming and principally fee over time. Yes, John, I'm happy to start with that. And before I do, I just wanted to add one last comment to the last question that Jim Kammert asked. And that has to do with not only a sustained and sustainable capital allocation cadence, that lends itself to a more sustained and sustainable funding cadence as opposed to the need to draw a whole lot of funding at one time for one deal. Anyway, to go on to your question about Cabot, Canyon Ranch and the others, we obviously -- we're talking here about assets that are under development or otherwise ramping. So we will obviously take the time we need and the time the operator needs to get the assets to where they can best sustain the opco/propco model, none of which at this point are immediately imminent. We were very excited about, obviously, what Cabot is doing in Cabot Citrus Farms. They have really created some session there. And I think, Samantha, we're pretty confident in saying that we look forward to the day when we can exercise our call right at Cabot Citrus Farms. But in the meantime, Samantha, do you want to add any color to what we're seeing in terms of mind share and market share. David? R.J., Good to hear be from you. That was not a deciding factor by any means. Obviously, we are aware, we're aware of the perception of overhang on the stock, and that was obviously -- it felt like a more significant factor through much of Q2 and even into the first couple of weeks of Q3 given the general state of the REIT equity market. But no, that wasn't a deciding factor and are deciding to announce it now. Again, the real driving factor was just to make sure everybody understood we've made a decision. And we're comfortable -- very comfortable announcing the decision. Very comfortable that we have very compelling other opportunities to allocate capital. And again, I would just go back to the point of our desire -- and we won't achieve it every time, but our desired capital allocation and capital funding strategies are based on being sustained and sustainable. We obviously spent a good number of our early years doing very big deals that had very big funding requirements, that generally needed to happen all in one day. And as VICI matures and as we achieve a sustained and sustainable cadence in AFFO growth, we want that to be driven by a sustained and sustainable cadence in both capital allocation activity, i.e., acquisitions and funding. I'll turn that over to David. But before I do, we obviously want to take care that the market never develops VICI ATM fatigue. And with that, I'll turn it over to David for any further color he wants to add. David? And Dan -- Dan, this is Ed. I would just add that we are always lending against experiential assets, that, in a worst-case scenario, would meet our strategic investment criteria. If again, in the worst case, the asset ever came into our hands, we would want -- we always want these to be assets that, in the worst case, we would be willing to own. John? Thank you, Carla. And we'll just thank all of you for your time on today's call. And wish you, once earnings season is over, an enjoyable rest of the summer. Bye for now."

Even though those certain investments are structured as mezz and preferred equity, we're very thoughtful about where our attachment point is and our last dollar. Looking at the operating history of the property kind of future underwriting projections and strength and sophistication of the sponsor, so that all goes into our underwriting. We have quarterly investment loan reviews, where we're working at the property performance and discuss it as a management team.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "John Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. We acted on the investment criteria Ed just spoke of when, in the second quarter, we made capital commitments of up to $950 million in the highly differentiated experiential buildings that have indispensable value to their occupants, namely the Venetian and a collection of Great Wolf Resorts. These are investments that live up to our quality criteria, and at the same time, the $650 million firmly committed to those investments will generate a blended investment yield of 7.9%. Our conviction that we can continue to identify and invest in experiential properties that are accretive against multiple quality factors is a key reason that we have decided that we will not be exercising our call right to acquire Harrah's Hoosier Park in Horseshoe, Indianapolis. We can and are making this decision because of our confidence and conviction that we are actively identifying and pursuing investment opportunities that enable us to generate future AFFO growth and accretion, while furthering the strength and diversity of our portfolio and tenant roster. At this time, we believe that we have the opportunity to create greater portfolio value by allocating VICI's capital to other gaming and nongaming opportunities the team is actively pursuing. This is an approach that we believe will produce 2024 AFFO [Indiscernible], bit higher in our net lease category. And with our newly [Indiscernible], we're in 2024 growth 2% at the midpoint is nearly 3 times the 2024 AFFO per growth rate guided into last week by our one gaming REIT peer. The factor that continues to accrue to our overall portfolio quality and structured tenant credit is the success of the dynamic city of Las Vegas, where VICI collects 45% of our rent from assets that we own. Over the years, I've cited on record-breaking [Indiscernible] in the first half of 2024. Harry Read International Airport had back-to-back record months reporting 5.1 million passengers arriving and parting in June. June was the third best month ever. Trailing May, the second best month ever. And October of 2023 was the best month ever. In May, international visitation of Vegas also jumped 23% year-over-year. And in June, it was reported that city officials are contemplating adding a second airport to Las Vegas, with executives from Southwest Airlines stating and I quote, \"It feels like any flight we add in a Vegas gets filled. It's almost this insatiable appetite for people wanting to come and see Vegas.\" Our Las Vegas tenants continue to benefit from this momentum as evidenced by our up to $700 million capital investment to fund extensive reinvestment projects at the Venetian in exchange for increased rent. The size and the success of our gaming properties allows us a unique opportunity to put large dollars to work into assets we already own. There continues to be a variety of opportunities on the horizon [Indiscernible] to the growth of our portfolio. Casino gaming assets continue to present the largest opportunity, both domestically and internationally, inclusive of investment opportunities into the casino resort properties we already own. The magnitude and consistency of gaming cash flows and the creativity of our gaming tenants continue to drive conviction in this section, and have set the blueprint REIT to extend our TAM and other experiential sectors. I now will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David? Yes, it's a very good question. I do think it's important. I heard my comments were broken also a little bit. But it is important to understand that this was a strategic decision really based on capital allocation and portfolio management at this time. We have great conviction with opportunities that are in front of us that will further our tenant and geographical and category diversity. And as we continue to look at opportunities and we negotiate put calls or renegotiate [Indiscernible], we'll think about the length of those and the appropriate times of those. Again, it's important to understand that we have great conviction to continue to grow the business around the world. Yes. Another good question. We have been busy traveling, not only domestically, but internationally. And I think on other calls, we've talked about countries that we've been studying. We've spent some time in Australia, in New Zealand. We've spent some time in Europe and the U.K. and other parts of the world where it makes sense and our capital can work. I don't have anything to announce now obviously, but we see opportunities to continue to diversify not only in location, but with new tenants as well. It seems like I am answering the first three questions today, Barry, but it's all good. I'm not sure we'll have the exact percentage of what's going to come in gaming and non-gaming. But I think you can imagine when we travel around the world, we spend time in countries with legalized gaming and understanding the real estate of those assets, while at the same time meeting with experiential operators. In my remarks, and I've said this for the past 7 years, the greatest opportunity we see is still in casino gaming, both domestically and internationally. But we do spend time with operators in both the experiential sectors in gaming when we travel around the world. The way the contract reads, you are correct, that the assets could be put to us. But Tom Reeg at Caesars, I think, has been very vocal about this, at least over the past year, that they had no plans to put these two assets to us. But the contract does last until the end of the year, as we spoke about earlier today. We all take that -- yes, I'll take that, Ed. We continue to look not only, I think you mentioned regional gaming, but I think we're looking all over the world where there are changes happening to the good, and I guess it could be to the bad, but where are there going to be opportunities to deploy capital with new tenants and new locations, possibly in new categories. And there are some places around the world that are going through quite a bit of change that we're better understanding. We'll continue to watch opportunities in the United States as well. Every year, I think you know the state of Texas and the state of Georgia, state of Kentucky often come out with some form of gaming. And then obviously, with online sports betting, which is spread across the United States, there will be other states that think about that. And usually, in some deals, they talk about the bricks-and-mortar casinos. So not specifically, but we stay in touch to see if there ultimately will be some opportunities for us to invest. And then I'll finally say, we continue to monitor New York, where that process continues to proceed into 2025. And we'll have a better understanding when 3 licenses will be awarded and to whom they are awarded. Yes. The question about will the facility that ultimately is built in downtown Chicago will impact the Indianapolis to casinos, the answer is now on that. To Ed's comments earlier about where consumers go to regional gaming and how far do they drive, the Indianapolis market is considerably far away from downtown Chicago. In fact, there's many other casinos between Indianapolis and Chicago that consumers can choose from as well. So that was not a factor in our decision to not call the to Indianapolis asset. Yes, David. Nice to talk to you. And hopefully, I'll see you on the road while I'm traveling. Look, you are correct. We're hearing in some businesses some softness and hearing about the consumer, and Ed touched on this earlier in his comments, particularly around the lower-end consumer. I was telling my colleague, David, a story about I was in Scotland recently. And every person I met talked about visiting United States. And guess what city -- if they were only going 2 to 3 cities, they said they would have to go to, it was Las Vegas. And what's become so interesting traveling the world is that 10 years ago, that wouldn't have been the answer, right? Everyone has said, I flying to New York. When I hit Chicago, I'm going to go on to San Francisco and the West Coast, and you probably wouldn't hear about Las Vegas. The beauty about what our tenants have done is diversifying the reasons to come to Las Vegas. And no matter what sector, whether you're in the high-end sector that comes by private jet, or where you're a sector that, like myself, travels by Southwest Airlines, they continue to attract different folks to that city. So I'm not giving you a macro answer about the whole world of the United States, I'm giving you an answer about where we look to put our money and where our money is right now, and that's why we're so bullish on Las Vegas. As we study other sectors, as we study other parts of the world, we will definitely make sure we understand what the consumer is doing up and down with spending tree. But I will tell you, in my travels, I'm excited about where we have our money and continue to put money in because that people are traveling to that destination of Las Vegas. Yes, it's a very good question, Michael. It's a hard one to answer simply because we have -- we used to be a company when we started that had 1 or 2 leases, now we've got over double digits. But in all our leases, we do have protection. Samantha Gallagher, our General Counsel is on the line, that could add to that. But we feel good. We're staying in touch with our operators to better understand what's going on in the market. I think you used the word chatter, I think that's probably the best word out there right now. But we do have protection in our many leases that we have. Sam, I don't know if you would like to add anything to the question? Yes, it's a great question, Chad. And I think you've heard us over the years talk about the sectors that we're looking at. And obviously, we've made investments in Pilgrim's Golf, indoor water parks, wellness sports. I think you're asking us a question about would we make an investment in the live entertainment, real estate and facilities. I know you're asking that question about Las Vegas, but would we also -- I think filters out into the rest of the United States. It is a sector that we have been spending some time and better understanding. We love what has happened in the city of Las Vegas with the growth of sports and entertainment. We're better understanding the economics of what happens inside those big buildings. They're absolutely beautiful and the shows are great, but can they support our model. And we're continuing to study that. And could there be an investment over time? There could be. But we want to make sure that the cash flows are durable and that the operator is a tenant that we want to be partners with for a long time. But it sure is exciting how Las Vegas has diversified its revenue stream and attracting new consumers by adding sports and entertainment, not just gambling and food and nightlife."

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Based on balance sheet, liquidity, results and our updated full year guidance, which we are very excited about. As we work on the right side of the balance sheet, we are constantly focusing on VICI's balance sheet quality, bringing our leverage further down within our range of 5 times to 5.5 times, diligently working with the rating agencies to improve our credit ratings over time and ultimately lowering our cost of capital, balancing the right long-term leverage for the company, all while ensuring we have the dry powder to continue to fund accretive growth for our owners. In terms of dry powder, as of today, we have approximately $3.2 billion in total liquidity, comprised of $347 million in cash and cash equivalents, $566 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding cohorts and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold 4 million shares and received approximately $115 million under our forward sale agreements. These proceeds were used to partially fund the Venetian capital investment John mentioned earlier. In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized second quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled foreign equity is approximately 4.4 times -- excuse me, 5.4 times, within our target leverage range of 5 times to 5.5 times. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%, taking into counter hedge portfolio at a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity. Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 5.9% compared to $0.54 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. We are very proud to deliver this continued consistent growth to our owners. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple-net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue. Our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items, and we have the highest net income margin in the S&P 500 as noted in an article published by Barron's during the month of July. Our G&A was $15.8 million for the quarter, and as a percentage of total revenues, it was only 1.6%. This continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple-net sector, but across all REITs. Turning to guidance. We are raising our AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024, is expected to now be between $2.35 billion and $2.37 billion, or between $2.24 and $2.26 per diluted common share. Based on the midpoint of our updated guidance range, VICI expects to deliver year-over-year AFFO per share growth of 4.7%. As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not closed, interest from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items. And as we have mentioned in the past, we reported noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis which was its inherent unpredictability leaves us enable forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of productivity on our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Wes. It is a good question. We're entering lease year 8 with Caesars. Hard to believe it's -- we're getting the lease year 8. So it seems like yesterday we started this company. But November 1 will be the start of that year and there does -- start of that lease year and there does become a variable component and a base component. And we are -- the way that the calculation runs for the Vegas lease, 80% is based, 20% is variable for the regional lease, it's 70% based and 30% variable. It's based on a comparison of net revenues for years 5 through 7 versus year 0 through 1. We are still collecting the data of Caesars because the calculation period actually runs through September of 2024. But based on what we're seeing, it should be relatively neutral to no impact to our escalation in November 1, 2024. Yes. Thanks, Ravi. Roughly, our credit book today is $2.2 billion, it's 4% to 5% of total assets, and we feel good in and around that area. We developed a credit book as a way to broaden our means and to expand our relationships. And you've heard us talk about, at the end of the day, our capital is relationship capital. And the credit book allows us to develop new partnerships, develop new relationships, ultimately through some of the deals that have call options at our discretion. But along the way, we learn about new segments and new businesses, and we've learned things that ultimately we may not like, we -- our loan gets repaid and we move on. But if we learn things we like, we continue to want to grow in those areas through either real estate ownership or deepening the existing relationships. So it's been a very, very effective tool and it's been something we're excited about, and something that we continue to use in our toolkit as we expand both domestically and internationally. Yes. In the broader indoor water park sector or, broadly, Gabe Wasserman is in the room here and he did our first white paper back in '18 when we started looking at indoor water parks and the economic vitality of these businesses. When the original Great Wolf went public back in '04, '05, it was Thursday through Sunday, Thursday through Monday business. Now it's a 7-day a week business. And we call them casinos without gaming, because of the economic leverage they have and the multiple cash registers they have, both with the water park, the family entertainment center, the food and beverage, the lodging. And as an example, Perryville opened just earlier this year -- last year. And within 3 months, it was exceeding its initial underwriting and ultimately went into the broader refi package. So these things open, they open quick and they open producing a lot of cash flow. So we're excited about that. And hopefully, there's an opportunity someday to own the real estate of some of these indoor water park businesses. Yes. No, you touched on it, Ed. It's portfolio management around not exercising the book call. Michael, in terms of the balance sheet, we've got 3 maturities next year, February, May and June. And as you saw us actively and very successfully refi our 2024 maturity with a well, well, well oversubscribed refinancing that we did back in March, we're working and planning towards refi those maturities that, again, come due first part -- in the first quarter and then in late second quarter of '25. And then you saw our peer, GLPI, had a very, very successful refi or a debt offering 2 days ago. And being investment-grade rated, having a very deep liquid investment-grade credit profile accrues to our benefit. And we're -- we feel very good about our ability to refi those maturities and continue to extend and ladder our maturity profile. And ultimately, over time, my data the BBB curve, lowering our cost of capital being able to continue to compete for asset acquisitions across the globe. I mean, Jim, you touched on that. I think when we lapped our first quarter earnings call, the thing -- the funding timing and some of the -- how we were going to fund some of the announcements that we had previously made weren't finalized. And so as we talked about in our guidance, we don't project any unknown capital markets activities or any unidentified or unknown activities. So those announcements plus the continued funding through our loan book has led us to feel very confident about the increase in guidance and feel very good about achieving that guidance. And a lot of it came from the Great Wolf impact, which closed slightly after our earnings. Yes, John, it's David. Yes, it's very minimal. If we've got to account for the forwards under the treasury stock dilution method, and it's a very, very minimal impact to the share count that shows up in our guidance range. No. Ed, you stole my line. That's exactly right. You've heard us say, under Mo''s leadership, we have a balanced approach to raising equity, whether that be an ATM, blocks, overnights, smart deals in connection with larger transactions. So we want to ensure that we raise capital the most efficiently, but also ensure that we are not developing or becoming stale in our style and then developing fatigue out there with our owners. Yes. Gabe is the envy of the VICI experiential credit solutions. He's here in the room, our Chief Accounting Officer. So for this Credit Solutions head on and answer that."

The first quarter of 2024 was, shall we say, an interesting quarter in the American equity marketplace. A fair part of the S&P 500 packed into a house and held a magnificent party. One Wall Street shop went so far as to say the party reached the rarified state of euphoria. Euphoria, that sounds kind of fun. But to be clear, American REITs were not invited to this party.\n Those of us who work within REITs were out on the curb outside that party house. From the outside, one could wonder if this was a party in which new monarchs were being coronated for perpetual rule or the kind of party that eventually ends with ambulances and/or cops being called and a few of the partygoers fleeing naked down the street out of their minds like Will Ferrell in Old School.\n The first quarter of 2024 is now over. The ambulances or cops haven't necessarily showed up yet, but the party inside that magnificent house seems to be running out of steam. The MOVE Index, which measures U.S. treasury market volatility, was relatively high but relatively steady through much of the first quarter and even fell a bit in late March in a flight to safety, but in early April, started acting rowdy again. And it's much the same with the VIX equity volatility index, which having slept through much of the magnificent party, recently spiked almost 50% since the start of the year before settling back down.\n Amidst all this noise, the general investment marketplace is having a hard time focusing on the income and capital appreciation dynamics of good REITs. At VICI, we can deal with all of this. We don't spend a lot of time standing on curbs wondering or complaining about parties we're not invited to. We just keep doing what we do at VICI, and that's working within our resources and capabilities to keep improving and growing our company for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders. That's what we did in Q1 2024.\n The first quarter of 2024 was a quarter in which we produced 6.1% growth in AFFO per share over Q1 2023 and continued to flow our revenue growth through to the EBITDA line at what we believe is one of the higher rates among S&P 500 REITs. The first quarter of 2024 was also a quarter in which we focused on 3 key strategic imperatives: imperative number one, expanding our scope and TAM in investment with our investment in Homefield Kansas City, a market-leading sports training complex that will also soon feature a Margaritaville resort. This is an investment that builds on our initial entry into the sports and recreation sector with a late 2023 acquisition of the primary leasehold interest in Chelsea Piers, an investment that validates the use of our lending platform to ultimately acquire a real estate interest, in this case, 780,000 magnificent square feet of New York recreational and entertainment space on the Hudson River.\n Imperative number two, being ready to refinance our maturing 2024 debt at an opportune time, debt that would have come due on May 1; yesterday, in other words. During Q1, May 1st seemed a fair way off, but given the volatility of market conditions, we didn't want to wait too long. We went to market on March 7 and did so on what turned out the second lowest point in March for U.S. 10-year yields. Yes, our timing was fortunate, but our good fortune relied on us being ready to go.\n Imperative #3, which we've just announced, capitalizing on the scale and rarity of our existing assets by working throughout Q1 with our partners at Apollo to develop a property enhancement plan for The Venetian, which gives VICI the opportunity to invest up to $700 million of capital into this magnificent Las Vegas Strip asset.\n In a moment, John and David will give you more color on each of these 3 Q1 2024 imperatives.\n I'll close out my opening remarks by saying the obvious. The first 16 or so weeks of 2024 haven't been a lot of fun for REIT investors. It's not clear at this point when the marketplace will recognize what we believe to be the total return value that REITs can and do represent at this point.  Most, not all, but most REIT categories currently offer dividend yields that are materially in excess of current inflation rates. And REIT dividends, unlike money market or bond interest payments, have the potential to grow over time, as VICI's has, with VICI posting a dividend growth CAGR of 7.9% since the first quarter of 2018 following our IPO.\n We've been living through a period in the equity marketplace in which the power of compounding has been somewhat ignored or forgotten. REITs can be powerful compounding tools. As a VICI shareholder, I haven't forgotten or ignored that compounding dynamic and benefit. I look forward to answering your questions, but first, a few words from John and David. John? \nJohn W. Payne: Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. Relationships are at the core of what we do at VICI and the quality of the relationships we have sets us apart. Our team works hard to strengthen existing ones and develop new ones so that we are best positioned for future growth opportunities, whether or not we are invited to what Ed has called the party. \n Our focus on trust in finding mutually beneficial solutions with our partners multiplies the beneficial impact of each relationship and we believe lays the groundwork for future growth through both good and bad market environments. One of the best examples of this is our relationship with Apollo and the team at The Venetian. The opportunity to acquire The Venetian originated during the COVID pandemic, another period of uncertainty with a challenging market backdrop.\n Since that time, the team at The Venetian has outperformed all expectations as Las Vegas has continued to solidify itself as the entertainment center of the world. We are thrilled to further expand our close relationship with Apollo and announced our opportunity to invest up to $700 million at The Venetian through VICI's Partner Property Growth Fund. This capital investment will fund several projects that seek to improve the overall guest experience and enhance the value of the property.\n The impact of our increasingly dynamic Las Vegas has continued to accrue to the benefit of The Venetian since we acquired the property together with Apollo in 2022, particularly with the neighboring Sphere, events like F1 and Super Bowl and an active convention schedule. The Venetian is set to celebrate its 25th anniversary this Saturday, and we're thrilled to partner with Apollo once again in their efforts to maximize the economic potential of this amazing iconic Strip asset.\n Gaming remains at VICI's core with over 98% of rent coming from our gaming partners, and the sector remains broadly healthy from a tenant credit perspective. Las Vegas continues to enjoy healthy growth with GGR up low single digits following the Super Bowl this quarter, and that is on top of an already impressive baseline, given gaming revenue increased 12% in the first quarter of 2023 over 2022.\n Since the market emerged from the pandemic, there has been 12 straight quarters, I'm going to repeat that, there has been 12 straight quarters of GGR growth in Las Vegas. Additionally, Las Vegas visitation numbers were up 4.2% in the first quarter, demonstrating the continued diversity of the revenue streams and the vast array of consumers enjoying this amazing city. In fact, based on a recent study from the University of Toronto that evaluated North American cities pre and post pandemic, Las Vegas is the only city that has surpassed pre-pandemic unique visitation numbers.\n In the regional gaming markets, while we recognize idiosyncratic weather headwinds this winter, we believe fundamentals remain sound, and we see steady consumer discretionary spend driven by the middle and high-end consumers on the casino floor. Although interest rate volatility has impacted transaction volume in the gaming market, we are active in dialogue around real estate opportunities in the gaming sector. Outside of our embedded growth pipeline, our relationships and gaming focus put us in a strong position when transactions or opportunities to invest in our existing properties arise.\n We continue to monitor the performance of Harrah's Hoosier Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis, for which we have a call right to acquire the real estate and buildings of these unique assets. This call right expires at the end of 2024 and we continue to work through the process with the appropriate Indiana regulatory agencies to gain the necessary gaming approvals should we elect to execute this option. \n VICI is also well positioned for incremental opportunities outside the gaming space as we've continued to expand our scope and our TAM of investments. We are committed to ensuring that each experiential sector and potential partner meets our investment criteria of low cyclicality, low secular threat, improving track record of growth and favorable supply and demand dynamics.\n In January of this year, VICI expanded its investment in the youth sports sector with the announcement of the up to $105 million construction loan agreement with affiliates of Homefield Kansas City to fund the development of a Margaritaville resort that will be embedded within Homefield's broader youth sports complex. The youth sports training center hosted 115 teams this last weekend for a basketball tournament and the baseball facility is open and in use. The Margaritaville resort is expected to be completed in 2025. Having visited the area a few weeks ago, I can tell you all the facilities are truly amazing.\n The Homefield partnership adds to our youth sports investment, as Ed said, which we initiated with our 2020 mortgage loan to Chelsea Piers in New York City. And at the end of 2023, we acquired the leasehold interest in the property and converted the initial loan into real estate ownership.\n While REITs were broadly excluded from, as Ed put it, the party that took place in the first quarter of 2024, the effects of the transactions and relationships announced at the end of last year and the beginning of this year contributed to our 6.1% growth in AFFO per share. As I stated earlier, our relationships are at the foundation of our business and drive our growth. Our standard for prudent underwriting gives us confidence in our roster of existing partners with whom we believe we have many growth opportunities. We look forward to developing new relationships with best-in-class operators so that VICI can continue to grow its quality experiential real estate portfolio.\n Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David? \nDavid Kieske: Thanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today, and we greatly appreciate your time. Starting with our balance sheet, as Ed mentioned, in the first quarter, we successfully -- I'll say, very successfully executed our first refinancing of the $1.50 billion May 2024 notes that came -- that would have come due yesterday.\n On March 7, we launched a bond offering and at its peak, we are 12x oversubscribed. We ultimately issued $550 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 5.75% and $500 million of 30-year notes at a coupon of 6.125%, for a blended yield of 5.9% before the impact of our forward interest rate swaps.  When compared to the coupon of 5.625% that we refinanced, we feel really good about the all-in coupon we were able to achieve and at the same time, extend the duration of our maturity profile.\n During the quarter, we also bolstered our liquidity and sold 9.7 million shares, raising $305 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward. Currently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $515 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, $683 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards, and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility.\n In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we sit here today, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current macro environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital.\n In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized first quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, is approximately 5.4x, within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%, taking into account our hedge portfolio, and a weighted average 6.8 years to maturity.\n Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.56 for the quarter, an increase of 6.1% compared to the $0.53 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong, in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\n Our G&A was $16.2 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, and continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector but across all REITs.\n Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As we originally highlighted on our Q4 earnings call, AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to be between $2.32 billion and $2.355 billion, or between $2.22 and $2.25 per diluted common share.\n As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not yet closed, interest income from any loans that do not have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items.\n And as we have previously mentioned, we recorded noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused, and we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Caitlin Burrows at Goldman Sachs. \nCaitlin Burrows: I guess one of the ways for VICI to identify and complete deals is when your partners are growing and expanding. So can you give some color on how your partners are doing and to what extent they're in the position to be expanding right now? I guess we can see the opportunity with The Venetian, but what else should we consider? \nEdward Pitoniak: John, do you want to start? \nJohn W. Payne: I will start, and I'll start first in our portfolio in Las Vegas because I think that's been a real center of where we've grown our company, and we have great operators there. We obviously announced The Venetian today, and you heard in my opening remarks that I believe, and maybe I'm a little bit biased, but this is the fastest-growing or the best city in hospitality in the world as it continues to attract a wide variety of consumers. So that provides opportunities for our partners, whether that's MGM, Caesars, we announced with Venetian. We've got a partner in Hard Rock that owns the Mirage that are all studying ways to continue to reinvent their business and add additional amenities to these amazing assets.\n The beauty of the assets in Las Vegas is the magnitude of opportunities that they have and the magnitude of square footage that they have in these assets to continue to not only remodel, but there are large parts of these assets that are unused at this time that could be brought either back to life or have never been in life with new concepts. So I can't give you any details that we haven't announced, but our operators have all talked about the development of their Las Vegas assets.\n Outside Las Vegas, there are some regional markets that continue to grow. We own some of the best assets out there, and we continue to talk to our partners about how we could potentially use our capital to grow their businesses. And we've announced previously some opportunities with Century, and I think there'll be some opportunities with some of our larger and our smaller operators. So Ed, I'll start with that if you want to add anything to that answer. \nEdward Pitoniak: I would only add, John, and Caitlin, good to hear from you, that obviously, depending on the outcome of the New York gaming licensing process, were the MGM asset in Yonkers, which we own the real estate of, to gain one of the full licenses, that would obviously be an opportunity for us to invest substantial capital in the recreation of that asset. \nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. And then you guys were talking about the Homefield partnership. I was wondering if you could just maybe remind us the status of your current construction loan there, which I don't think itself is a huge exposure for VICI, but as we think about the potential growth and scope of that relationship, what it could be like? \nEdward Pitoniak: David? \nDavid Kieske: Yes, Caitlin, we started funding that upon an announcement. And so that's an 18-odd-month development builds, but it's really the proceeds that are going into the Margaritaville Hotel to use to build the Margaritaville Hotel, excuse me. As John mentioned, the team was out there a week or so ago and saw the sports facilities that are ultimately part of our real estate that we do have the option to call in the future once everything is up and running and stabilized. But they are a best-in-class youth sports operator, and while there's no immediate intentions to grow, they are realizing the benefits of what they're creating and may have opportunities in the future to expand what they are successfully building in Kansas City. \nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. \nAnthony Paolone: I guess my first question is, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking about return requirements and your cost of capital and any sort of spread? When I look at Venetian, it's obviously a tremendous asset and a strong relationship, and you talked about the importance of that. Then the flip is, I guess you got some flat term for a little bit, and it's also more of a CapEx investment as opposed to new assets. So maybe just help us with putting some dimensions around how you're thinking about the right levels of return in your own cost of capital. \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Tony, good to hear from you. The starting point is that, over time, we are obviously solving for blended yield on our investments. When we have the opportunity to put capital into an asset as rarefied as The Venetian and still maintain an accretive spread, to the point of your note, not a vast accretive spread and not our targeted blended rate of return. But if we can match an investment like The Venetian with investments, whether acquisitions or property or lending investments that give us more substantial yields, more substantial spreads, we feel, on a net-net basis, we're creating a lot of value for shareholders. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just my second one, John, you mentioned on the Centaur assets going through some regulatory process right now. Does that mean that if you do exercise the option, the close would be pretty immediate? Is that what to read there? Or just wondering what that meant. \nJohn W. Payne: Tony, I don't think that's necessary. It's funny. First of all, it's funny we still call them the Centaur assets. It is Harrah's Hoosier Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis. We do the same the same thing. But no, Tony, I mean we're going through the process with the appropriate Indiana regulatory agencies. And should we elect to execute this option, we will make sure that we follow all the rules and the regulations. But to your question about timing, really no position on that other than we're going through and spending the appropriate time with those agencies. \nOperator: Our next question is from Barry Jonas from Truist. \nBarry Jonas: I was curious, how deep is the pipeline for additional partner property growth investments? And then I guess, as we think about those investments like Venetian, how should we think about the potential for those ROI improvements converting to sale leaseback at some point? \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. So I think as a starting point, Barry, it's valuable to remember that from what we can determine, we are the largest owner of hotel room real estate in America. We're the largest private sector owner of convention space in America, one of the largest owners of restaurants, theaters, other kinds of entertainment spaces. What are we right now, David, about 130 million square feet? \nDavid Kieske: Just under that. That's right. \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. So Barry, when you think about having 130 million square feet of existing property, 1% and 2% of that number as potential reinvestment opportunities is a pretty compelling opportunity unto itself. As John mentioned, The Strip obviously represents a very compelling opportunity. We're particularly excited about the opportunities that could be at the south end of The Strip. We're in partnership with MGM. We own 5 assets, I believe it is. And that is an end of The Strip that, as you know, Barry, has taken on a vitality in recent years that it didn't have before.\n The T-Mobile obviously added to the vitality at that end of The Strip, Allegiant definitely added a lot and the A's stadium could potentially add a lot of vitality. And so when you look at assets like MGM Grand, New York, New York Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and Park MGM, we, with our partners, MGM, who obviously reported a very good quarter last night, are excited about what the densification opportunities could be over the coming years. \nJohn W. Payne: Barry, can I add just one thing to that. Not only are -- do I agree 100% with Ed on the assets, it's also the operators that run these assets, that they are constantly looking at ways to attract more consumers and to generate more business. So you can have a great asset, but if the operator doesn't want to change it and wants to sit on their hands, the gaming operators, particularly in Las Vegas, are the best in the world in the hospitality space, and they are constantly looking at ways to build, reinvent their business. And so those 2 things combined, not only the assets are incredible, but having operators that want to change and grow and innovate is a formula for us to be able to continue to grow with the Property Growth Fund. \nEdward Pitoniak: And Barry, before we move to your second question, Samantha wants to clarify an assumption that you made in your question that, in fact, isn't quite right. \nSamantha Gallagher: Yes. Thanks, Barry. So you asked if we will have the opportunity to convert that via sale leaseback. And we actually don't need to do that because we own the capital improvement and that reverts to us via rent. So it's not something that we need to then, in the future, convert via sale leaseback. That's one of the benefits we think of the Property Growth Fund. \nBarry Jonas: But do you have a chance, I guess, to -- I think like if you look at the predecessor MGP, there are instances where they acquired an additional improvement and that drove increased rent. Does that opportunity exist, just so I'm sure I understand? \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. I mean it's in essence what we're doing, yes, exactly. We're investing incremental capital and in return for incremental capital, we get incremental rent. \nBarry Jonas: Okay, okay. Understood. And then just quickly as a follow-up, curious as you're looking at deals if the competitive environment is the same or if you're seeing kind of any new spaces at those parties, as it's called? \nJohn W. Payne: It continues to remain -- it's the same, Barry. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John DeCree from CBRE. \nJohn DeCree: Maybe one to start on Las Vegas. John, I think in your prepared remarks, you've mentioned what a great hospitality market Las Vegas is, and we certainly agree. Curious how you guys think about your net exposure to the market following The Venetian investment. And in the context of -- if you could remind us if you have officially committed to anything at the Mirage yet. Obviously, Hard Rock is considering a pretty big rebrand there. And you've mentioned a number of partners possibly considering activating space. So when you think about all the potential opportunities, are you kind of comfortable with that? Do you kind of have a ceiling in which you'd like to go to and how much capital you deploy to Las Vegas, how do you kind of think about your exposure to that market over the near to medium term? \nJohn W. Payne: Ed, do you want me to take that? \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Yes, he was asking you, John. \nJohn W. Payne: Yes. John, so let's talk a little bit about all the different areas of Las Vegas. So today, we have an incredible amount of assets in -- on The Strip. We have 10 assets on the Las Vegas Strip that we're very excited about. Where we do not have any investments yet, where we see potential for growth is in the regional market of Las Vegas and in the downtown market of Las Vegas. So you could see VICI continue to grow in the Las Vegas market, and it could be on The Strip, but it also could be in these other areas. And those are great segments of the business that we simply don't have real estate or partners yet along the way.\n So -- and then I think you also asked about the Mirage and our work with -- we continue to speak with the Hard Rock team who's running the Mirage on ways that we can help them grow, but we have not made any announcement on that yet, John. \nJohn DeCree: Got it. Maybe a high-level follow-up for whoever wants to take it. It's kind of an observation first that a lot of the casino industry, your partners and others' preference for development or project CapEx right now. We see that with The Venetian. Interest rate volatility is probably a part of the answer to the question, but why do you think we've seen more capital deployed in existing properties or new development relative to M&A, assuming your kind of cost of capital as a financing source for casino industry participants is still pretty competitive? So we would think M&A could still be a logical option yet we've seen kind of all developments. So just curious if you guys have a view why that might be other than maybe just interest rates. \nEdward Pitoniak: And just so we're clear, John DeCree, here's being about M&A among the gaming operators themselves? Are you speaking more narrowly about the trading of assets? \nJohn DeCree: Yes. I guess it's probably more amongst the strategic buyers of your partners, buying and selling, which would maybe pull you in as a financing source. So the casino industry developing and investing in properties rather than acquiring. It seems like we're in a different part of the cycle. Presumably, if we saw more M&A amongst your partners, that would create more opportunities for you as well. \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. Yes, you're right. And honestly, you probably have -- you'd have to ask the operators as to why they believe there isn't more M&A right now. I could speculate, and that's all I'm doing. Obviously, the operators, so many of them are trading so cheaply right now, bafflingly, bafflingly so, however you want to measure the valuation, including obviously, free cash flow yield. And so it could be a time when people say, I'm not going to sell, not at this point. \n But again, you really have to ask them. And it could also be the fact that the economic performance of the operators has been so strong coming out of COVID. I think one open question could obviously be okay, are these peak earnings? Are we going to sustain them? We believe that the earnings power of our operating partners is going to continue, but one could reasonably ask, okay, I don't want to be the guy who buys at what turned out to be a peak only to see economic performance normalize as the COVID effect wears away. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. \nDavid Katz: And I wanted to just get your take on some of the non-gaming initiatives and pursuits. Obviously, they're exciting in terms of TAM. But can you just talk about the -- how you view the durability, the long-term durability of those asset classes such as Bowlero or Canyon Ranch, et cetera, and how that compares with your initial core in Las Vegas? \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. No, it's a very good question, David. And it's an essential question we're continually asking ourselves as we investigate new experiential categories. And you've heard us talk in the past about our 4 key criteria of healthy supply/demand balance, low to no secular, threat the durability of the end-user experience and lower-than-average cyclicality.\n I would add to that, that we're looking for businesses that have an economic dynamism to them, which tends to really center on a certain amount of revenue complexity, or as we've come to like to say, cash register intensity. And we want that to be coupled with an operator who knows how to make the most of that economic dynamism. They're energetic operators and they're very economically astute operators.\n And I would say that one of the key criteria among those is the durability question. Is it an asset class that has been around for decades? Has it proven itself through every economic cycle and through all the different demographic cycles? And I will give you an example right now of a category that we would be nervous about. And that is the -- I guess if you want to call it a category into itself, that would be pickleball, right? It's an incredibly popular sport right now. It hasn't been around long. And the supply/demand balance question is very much an open one because it's not hard to put pickleball courts just about anywhere, public parks, parking lots, you name it.\n And I am old enough to remember a sport called racketball, which was a very popular sport in the '70s and the '80s. And I don't know about you, David. I don't see a lot of racketball courts around anymore. I have no idea why they're not around, it was a fun game. You didn't have to be terribly highly skilled to play it and have fun, but it's kind of gone. So we take very, very seriously the question of durability. And there is really no better evidence of durability than durability, that it has been around a while and it has succeeded through all cycles. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. \nBennett Rose: John, I wanted to follow up with something John said and you -- I think you said in your opening remarks that in the regional market, revenues are being driven by the middle and the high end of the market. And my question is, is that kind of always the case? Or are your operators starting to see some weakness with a lower-end consumer? And do you have any concerns about that, I guess, as you sort of think about the portfolio overall? \nJohn W. Payne: Yes, Smedes, good to talk to you. Probably a better question for the operating side of our business or the operators, but I'll give it a go here a little bit. In my comments, we're about in the regional markets, like you said, the middle and the high-end consumers are still coming in their frequency based on the information from our tenants. I think you're asking or do we believe that those lower segments will come back. I think that really depends on the operator. Is the operator pulling back incentives to those consumers and they've elected not to come because they find more ways to spend their marketing dollars in a more efficient way? So again, more an operator conversation.\n But Smedes, again, you're asking how does that affect VICI?  As I always like to say, and you know this well, even with every casino closed in the world during the pandemic, VICI collected 100% of our rent on time and in cash. So if segments of the business see a little bit of a downturn, not even negative, VICI is going to collect our rent or historically has collected our rent. \n So we monitor these things. I stay on top of it because I'm a recovering operator, but in the core business of what we do, those downturns, upturns don't have a huge change in our look at the business. We look much more big picture, longer-term, years out. Does that make sense, Smedes? \nBennett Rose: Yes. No, absolutely. I just -- it sounds like maybe it's more of a strategic goal from the operator side. And just -- we're just hearing on other calls, there just seems to be a sense that maybe consumers are starting to pull back a little bit. There's some weakness in different leisure segments. So I'm just kind of curious if you guys had insight there.\n I wanted to ask you as well, there's been press reports that MGM Resorts is looking to I guess, sell their operating rights at the MGM Springfield. And whether or not they do or not, I don't know if -- you probably can't comment on that, but I'm just -- could you talk about sort of what VICI's role would be in that process and how you guys are thinking about it from your perspective, if that were to move forward? \nEdward Pitoniak: John, do you want to take that? Or do you want Samantha to take that? \nJohn W. Payne: Samantha. \nSamantha Gallagher: Yes. As you know, obviously, we wouldn't comment on any of our operators' sale transactions. But to the extent they were to sell an operating business, we obviously retain the asset and would enter into a lease with any transferring of that asset. \nEdward Pitoniak: And you've seen that happen in a few -- yes, and Smedes, I'll just add that you've seen that in a few instances with our assets, Southern Indiana being one, Gold Strike being another. So we have definitely figured out how to work through those processes with existing tenants and new. \nOperator: Our next question is from Daniel Guglielmo from Capital One. \nDaniel Guglielmo: You all have a diverse group of partners and tenants, both large and small. This earnings season, there have been some questions around the health of the U.S. and Canadian consumers from a risk perspective. And just acknowledging that you all are well fortified at the lease level, but are there certain areas of the portfolio you're thinking about more trying to understand better in this environment? \nEdward Pitoniak: I wouldn't say, Daniel, it's so much about particular assets or even particular geographies. But I do think it goes back to the question Smedes asked a moment ago, which is what kind of behaviors you're seeing for consumer segment and their income and their spending power. And I do think one of the more -- one of the elements of cognitive dissonance right now is this disparity between lower-income consumers and higher-end consumers and the degree to which you are seeing some degree of stress and/or at least less liquidity for these lower-end consumers than you might have a year or 2 ago when we were seeing the benefits of so many of the stimulus plans that came out of COVID.\n So we obviously -- we monitor it closely. We monitor it for the impact it can obviously have on our partners. But we also monitor it as part of our overall monitoring of the economy and the credit markets. And the degree to which the remarks that Jerome Powell made yesterday when he was kind of nice Jerome as opposed to scary Jerome, I think there's a recognition even at the Fed that despite a lot of our macro measures appearing to be very robust, there are some tensions in the economy right now. \nDaniel Guglielmo: Great. Yes. I appreciate the detailed response, and that makes sense. And then just real quick around some of the development financing in the loans and securities bucket. I'm sure you all talk with those teams on a regular basis. Can you just give us an idea if there have been any recent headwinds or tailwinds that you're hearing about from them? \nDavid Kieske: Yes, Dan, it's David. Good to hear from you. No, we have a very thorough asset management loan administration process and we monitor both our tenants and our loan investments very closely. And we talk to, as John mentioned, we talk to the operators and we also talk to our borrowers, and they are not seeing any headwinds in terms of development completion or asset performance where we do have these loan investments. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Herring from Green Street. \nMichael Herring: Just looking at the Venetian deal, it obviously looks like a win-win from our perspective, at least just in the sense of Apollo's cost of finance and then the yield that VICI gets to invest on The Strip in Vegas. I was wondering, could you guys walk through maybe how those negotiations kind of transpired and how you came to that final yield number given that it is favorable or it looks favorable on both sides? And how that might look for future similar investments on The Strip with other partners that you guys have? \nEdward Pitoniak: Sure. Yes, Michael, good question. John? \nJohn W. Payne: Michael, it's nice to talk to you this morning. And we agree that this is a win-win for both companies. You initially asked when did these discussions started. They actually started when we initially did the lease back in -- during the pandemic. And when we bought the real estate with Apollo or we bought the real estate and they bought the operation of Venetian, we knew that they were going to grow the business. We didn't know they were going to grow it as fast as they hadn't been so successful there, and we're very, very proud of them. But we talked about the Property Growth Fund and where there could be opportunities for us to grow.  So the discussion started, and we do this often when we're doing deals to not only think about the deal that's in front of us, but where there are opportunities for us to grow, particularly with great assets like The Venetian.\n And then as it comes to the pricing, like anything, we -- since we started the company, we tried to create beneficial deals for both sides. If one side kind of wins, it's not great for a long-term relationship. So I opened up my remarks today and I -- someone may have rolled their eyes about that this is about relationships, but it really is about relationships. And when you can look across the table from a good partner, you get to a price that they feel good about, we feel good about and the transaction happens. And as you said, it's been a win-win, and we're just excited to help them add these great new amenities and upgrade the amenities that they have. \nMichael Herring: Got it. And just sticking with the Venetian deal. Obviously, you laid out the terms of the initial disbursements and the $400 million [ tallied ] can be up to $700 million. Is the entire scope of the project that Apollo is looking to take on, is that included in the initial $400 million? Or will they eventually need that $300 million eventually, it's just whether or not they want to use that option? \nDavid Kieske: Michael, it's David. One of the things you should look at is the Venetian press release that they put out yesterday where they, ahead of a 25th anniversary of the asset this Saturday, actually, where they have laid out extensive value enhancement plans well in excess of $700 million actually.  So it's just a little bit of timing on their side as they work through the initial $400 million this year. They've got a lot of things in the hopper and things that they've already done. And then just a bit of as that all comes together, what their pace of potentially drawing that incremental $300 million, where that falls in and how they use that capital going forward. \nEdward Pitoniak: And Michael, just to add to that, I believe you'll see the press release talks about a total of about $1.5 billion of total investment into The Venetian, of which we may end up being about half of that. But I want to stress the point that I don't know of another REIT category where tenants put more capital into the REIT's asset than ours. If you look across our portfolio, both our Las Vegas portfolio and our regional portfolio, any given year, our tenants are putting hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars into our assets, making our assets more valuable. That obviously doesn't get captured in the models per se, given that obviously, the transparency around the exact capital that our tenants put into each one of our assets is not necessarily there. But we can tell you, based on what we know of their investment activities, that no other REIT that we know enjoys greater benefit from tenant reinvestment into our properties. \nOperator: The next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. \nGreg McGinniss: So given that the Venetian deal originally had potential to be up to $1 billion, does that mean there remains another $300 million here down the line? Or does this exhaust that initial agreement?\n And in general, for the Partner Property Growth Fund, is there -- could there potentially be more concrete agreements ahead of time like in the case of The Venetian or for situations like you're talking about in terms of the south side of The Strip and MGM where there might be something? Is it more likely to just have an actual investment be announced as opposed to, again, the potential for one? \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes. David or John? \nDavid Kieske: Greg, I can start, and John can maybe chime in. Yes, potentially, there could be more than $700 million that comes out of our agreement here. The original $1 billion announcement back in 2022, we modified that as the team worked through and got in under the hood, so to speak, of the asset and realize what they wanted to do or what they want to undertake. So there's some tweaks to the original agreement on our side. And as Ed just laid out, the announcement that The Venetian put out yesterday has up to $1.5 billion or their plan is to invest $1.5 billion into the assets. So there could be incremental capital. But what we've documented and announced with our great partners at Apollo and Patrick and team and Rob into The Venetian is this incremental $700 million investment today.\n And to the second part of your question, there could be incremental dollars that we put in across the portfolio. It was because of the uniqueness of our assets versus any other REITs out there. \nJohn W. Payne: Yes, Greg, I think you should hear that we like these opportunities. And as Ed just pointed out a few minutes ago, there aren't many REITs that have this unique lever to pull to grow. I mean there aren't many REITs that are going to say, \"Hey, we're going to put $700 million into an asset.\" There are some REITs that can't even say I want to put $700 million into my whole portfolio. We're talking one of our 93 assets. So we like this opportunity to help our partners grow, and that's one of the uniqueness that VICI has that we have the -- and we were talking earlier, we can go to M&A. We can help buy other assets, but we also have this lever that we've been talking about for years that is coming to life today with The Venetian. \nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And David, just on the maintained guidance real quick. Was there no additional drawdown on loans without final draw structure in Q1? Or is it just at an immaterial level to have no impact on the full year guide? \nDavid Kieske: No -- sorry, the first part of your -- around the draw schedules, Greg? I mean we still feel really good about our guidance -- sorry, go ahead. \nGreg McGinniss: Yes. So I understand that for loans without draw schedules, that's not included in future guidance. And I'm not exactly sure what was drawn, if anything. Assumption would be that there was. \nDavid Kieske: Yes, it's immaterial if there were any, so we feel really good about our guidance range where we sit here today. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. \nRonald Kamdem: Just 2 quick ones. Just first, just looking for some qualitative comments starting with the annual letter about sort of higher rates and the impact of activity, just as you've seen sort of this recent spate of movements on the rate front, just qualitative comments on what that's doing to the pipeline, where the decisions are taking longer and so on and so forth, or if anything's falling out? \nEdward Pitoniak: Yes, it's a timely question, Ron. I mean it's definitely having a fairly chilling effect on trading activity really across most all asset classes. And that's why we really value having levers to pull or tools in our toolbox where we can generate growth during periods when it would otherwise be difficult to do through conventional asset trading activity. Those obviously include things like our property partner growth fund, The Venetian being an example, through our credit book, through our expansion of existing relationships. And then again, too, having the tool in the toolbox of non-gaming and being able to do things with partners like Chelsea Piers, Homefield, Cabot and Canyon Ranch when, again, the trading of assets would otherwise be difficult -- and is difficult, frankly. \nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then just the second question, just staying on the pipeline, is there sort of more activity on the gaming side, non-gaming side, all of the above? Just any sort of color there would be helpful. \nJohn W. Payne: We continue to spend time... \nEdward Pitoniak: John? \nJohn W. Payne: Yes, we continue to spend time in a lot of different sectors on the non-gaming side, whether that's wellness, indoor water parks, pilgrimage golf, youth sports, you've heard us make an investment. But at the same time, let's remember, as I said in my opening remarks, we get 98% of our rent from our gaming assets, and we continue to spend time with our current partners and others to grow. So for us, I know we get asked a fair amount about our non gaming, but it shouldn't be forgotten that we're also spending a lot of time in gaming. So the answer is both, spending time in both. \nOperator: Okay. We have no further questions on the call. So I'll hand the floor back to Ed for the final closing remarks. \nEdward Pitoniak: All right. Thanks, everybody. So I want to close out the call by just reiterating how much value we believe we're creating with the announcement we made yesterday afternoon of our investment in The Venetian with our partner, Apollo. And I'm going to actually read from somebody's note because, frankly, this note expresses it better than I ever could.\n And in this note, the author says we view the Venetian cap rate spread as attractive, especially considering how tight spreads are elsewhere in net lease. Bigger picture, we view this as VICI capitalizing on its relationships to double down on a winning hand. In parenthesis, The Venetian may be VICI's best acquisition to date, close parenthesis. Despite higher interest rates, there's just nowhere else in today's triple net lease market where you can put that amount of money, $700 million up to, to work into that kind of irreplaceable real estate at a 7.25% cap rate. Then in parenthesis, delusional sellers are still looking for sub-7 cap rates on their poorly-located Red Lobsters. I could not have said it better myself.\n And again, we just want to thank you for your time today and reemphasize that as noisy as it is out there and confusing at times in the marketplace, the VICI team is a team that continues to get good things done. Again, thanks for your time today, and we'll see you again in the next quarter. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all very much for joining.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Edward Pitoniak",
            "content": "Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter of 2024 was, shall we say, an interesting quarter in the American equity marketplace. A fair part of the S&P 500 packed into a house and held a magnificent party. One Wall Street shop went so far as to say the party reached the rarified state of euphoria. Euphoria, that sounds kind of fun. But to be clear, American REITs were not invited to this party.\n Those of us who work within REITs were out on the curb outside that party house. From the outside, one could wonder if this was a party in which new monarchs were being coronated for perpetual rule or the kind of party that eventually ends with ambulances and/or cops being called and a few of the partygoers fleeing naked down the street out of their minds like Will Ferrell in Old School.\n The first quarter of 2024 is now over. The ambulances or cops haven't necessarily showed up yet, but the party inside that magnificent house seems to be running out of steam. The MOVE Index, which measures U.S. treasury market volatility, was relatively high but relatively steady through much of the first quarter and even fell a bit in late March in a flight to safety, but in early April, started acting rowdy again. And it's much the same with the VIX equity volatility index, which having slept through much of the magnificent party, recently spiked almost 50% since the start of the year before settling back down.\n Amidst all this noise, the general investment marketplace is having a hard time focusing on the income and capital appreciation dynamics of good REITs. At VICI, we can deal with all of this. We don't spend a lot of time standing on curbs wondering or complaining about parties we're not invited to. We just keep doing what we do at VICI, and that's working within our resources and capabilities to keep improving and growing our company for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders. That's what we did in Q1 2024.\n The first quarter of 2024 was a quarter in which we produced 6.1% growth in AFFO per share over Q1 2023 and continued to flow our revenue growth through to the EBITDA line at what we believe is one of the higher rates among S&P 500 REITs. The first quarter of 2024 was also a quarter in which we focused on 3 key strategic imperatives: imperative number one, expanding our scope and TAM in investment with our investment in Homefield Kansas City, a market-leading sports training complex that will also soon feature a Margaritaville resort. This is an investment that builds on our initial entry into the sports and recreation sector with a late 2023 acquisition of the primary leasehold interest in Chelsea Piers, an investment that validates the use of our lending platform to ultimately acquire a real estate interest, in this case, 780,000 magnificent square feet of New York recreational and entertainment space on the Hudson River.\n Imperative number two, being ready to refinance our maturing 2024 debt at an opportune time, debt that would have come due on May 1; yesterday, in other words. During Q1, May 1st seemed a fair way off, but given the volatility of market conditions, we didn't want to wait too long. We went to market on March 7 and did so on what turned out the second lowest point in March for U.S. 10-year yields. Yes, our timing was fortunate, but our good fortune relied on us being ready to go.\n Imperative #3, which we've just announced, capitalizing on the scale and rarity of our existing assets by working throughout Q1 with our partners at Apollo to develop a property enhancement plan for The Venetian, which gives VICI the opportunity to invest up to $700 million of capital into this magnificent Las Vegas Strip asset.\n In a moment, John and David will give you more color on each of these 3 Q1 2024 imperatives.\n I'll close out my opening remarks by saying the obvious. The first 16 or so weeks of 2024 haven't been a lot of fun for REIT investors. It's not clear at this point when the marketplace will recognize what we believe to be the total return value that REITs can and do represent at this point.  Most, not all, but most REIT categories currently offer dividend yields that are materially in excess of current inflation rates. And REIT dividends, unlike money market or bond interest payments, have the potential to grow over time, as VICI's has, with VICI posting a dividend growth CAGR of 7.9% since the first quarter of 2018 following our IPO.\n We've been living through a period in the equity marketplace in which the power of compounding has been somewhat ignored or forgotten. REITs can be powerful compounding tools. As a VICI shareholder, I haven't forgotten or ignored that compounding dynamic and benefit. I look forward to answering your questions, but first, a few words from John and David. John? John, do you want to start? I would only add, John, and Caitlin, good to hear from you, that obviously, depending on the outcome of the New York gaming licensing process, were the MGM asset in Yonkers, which we own the real estate of, to gain one of the full licenses, that would obviously be an opportunity for us to invest substantial capital in the recreation of that asset. David? Yes. Tony, good to hear from you. The starting point is that, over time, we are obviously solving for blended yield on our investments. When we have the opportunity to put capital into an asset as rarefied as The Venetian and still maintain an accretive spread, to the point of your note, not a vast accretive spread and not our targeted blended rate of return. But if we can match an investment like The Venetian with investments, whether acquisitions or property or lending investments that give us more substantial yields, more substantial spreads, we feel, on a net-net basis, we're creating a lot of value for shareholders. Yes. So I think as a starting point, Barry, it's valuable to remember that from what we can determine, we are the largest owner of hotel room real estate in America. We're the largest private sector owner of convention space in America, one of the largest owners of restaurants, theaters, other kinds of entertainment spaces. What are we right now, David, about 130 million square feet? Yes. So Barry, when you think about having 130 million square feet of existing property, 1% and 2% of that number as potential reinvestment opportunities is a pretty compelling opportunity unto itself. As John mentioned, The Strip obviously represents a very compelling opportunity. We're particularly excited about the opportunities that could be at the south end of The Strip. We're in partnership with MGM. We own 5 assets, I believe it is. And that is an end of The Strip that, as you know, Barry, has taken on a vitality in recent years that it didn't have before.\n The T-Mobile obviously added to the vitality at that end of The Strip, Allegiant definitely added a lot and the A's stadium could potentially add a lot of vitality. And so when you look at assets like MGM Grand, New York, New York Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and Park MGM, we, with our partners, MGM, who obviously reported a very good quarter last night, are excited about what the densification opportunities could be over the coming years. And Barry, before we move to your second question, Samantha wants to clarify an assumption that you made in your question that, in fact, isn't quite right. Yes. I mean it's in essence what we're doing, yes, exactly. We're investing incremental capital and in return for incremental capital, we get incremental rent. Yes. Yes, he was asking you, John. And just so we're clear, John DeCree, here's being about M&A among the gaming operators themselves? Are you speaking more narrowly about the trading of assets? Yes. Yes, you're right. And honestly, you probably have -- you'd have to ask the operators as to why they believe there isn't more M&A right now. I could speculate, and that's all I'm doing. Obviously, the operators, so many of them are trading so cheaply right now, bafflingly, bafflingly so, however you want to measure the valuation, including obviously, free cash flow yield. And so it could be a time when people say, I'm not going to sell, not at this point. \n But again, you really have to ask them. And it could also be the fact that the economic performance of the operators has been so strong coming out of COVID. I think one open question could obviously be okay, are these peak earnings? Are we going to sustain them? We believe that the earnings power of our operating partners is going to continue, but one could reasonably ask, okay, I don't want to be the guy who buys at what turned out to be a peak only to see economic performance normalize as the COVID effect wears away. Yes. No, it's a very good question, David. And it's an essential question we're continually asking ourselves as we investigate new experiential categories. And you've heard us talk in the past about our 4 key criteria of healthy supply/demand balance, low to no secular, threat the durability of the end-user experience and lower-than-average cyclicality.\n I would add to that, that we're looking for businesses that have an economic dynamism to them, which tends to really center on a certain amount of revenue complexity, or as we've come to like to say, cash register intensity. And we want that to be coupled with an operator who knows how to make the most of that economic dynamism. They're energetic operators and they're very economically astute operators.\n And I would say that one of the key criteria among those is the durability question. Is it an asset class that has been around for decades? Has it proven itself through every economic cycle and through all the different demographic cycles? And I will give you an example right now of a category that we would be nervous about. And that is the -- I guess if you want to call it a category into itself, that would be pickleball, right? It's an incredibly popular sport right now. It hasn't been around long. And the supply/demand balance question is very much an open one because it's not hard to put pickleball courts just about anywhere, public parks, parking lots, you name it.\n And I am old enough to remember a sport called racketball, which was a very popular sport in the '70s and the '80s. And I don't know about you, David. I don't see a lot of racketball courts around anymore. I have no idea why they're not around, it was a fun game. You didn't have to be terribly highly skilled to play it and have fun, but it's kind of gone. So we take very, very seriously the question of durability. And there is really no better evidence of durability than durability, that it has been around a while and it has succeeded through all cycles. John, do you want to take that? Or do you want Samantha to take that? And you've seen that happen in a few -- yes, and Smedes, I'll just add that you've seen that in a few instances with our assets, Southern Indiana being one, Gold Strike being another. So we have definitely figured out how to work through those processes with existing tenants and new. I wouldn't say, Daniel, it's so much about particular assets or even particular geographies. But I do think it goes back to the question Smedes asked a moment ago, which is what kind of behaviors you're seeing for consumer segment and their income and their spending power. And I do think one of the more -- one of the elements of cognitive dissonance right now is this disparity between lower-income consumers and higher-end consumers and the degree to which you are seeing some degree of stress and/or at least less liquidity for these lower-end consumers than you might have a year or 2 ago when we were seeing the benefits of so many of the stimulus plans that came out of COVID.\n So we obviously -- we monitor it closely. We monitor it for the impact it can obviously have on our partners. But we also monitor it as part of our overall monitoring of the economy and the credit markets. And the degree to which the remarks that Jerome Powell made yesterday when he was kind of nice Jerome as opposed to scary Jerome, I think there's a recognition even at the Fed that despite a lot of our macro measures appearing to be very robust, there are some tensions in the economy right now. Sure. Yes, Michael, good question. John? And Michael, just to add to that, I believe you'll see the press release talks about a total of about $1.5 billion of total investment into The Venetian, of which we may end up being about half of that. But I want to stress the point that I don't know of another REIT category where tenants put more capital into the REIT's asset than ours.

            "name": "David Kieske",
            "content": "Thanks, John. It's great to speak with everyone today, and we greatly appreciate your time. Starting with our balance sheet, as Ed mentioned, in the first quarter, we successfully -- I'll say, very successfully executed our first refinancing of the $1.50 billion May 2024 notes that came -- that would have come due yesterday.\n On March 7, we launched a bond offering and at its peak, we are 12x oversubscribed. We ultimately issued $550 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 5.75% and $500 million of 30-year notes at a coupon of 6.125%, for a blended yield of 5.9% before the impact of our forward interest rate swaps.  When compared to the coupon of 5.625% that we refinanced, we feel really good about the all-in coupon we were able to achieve and at the same time, extend the duration of our maturity profile.\n During the quarter, we also bolstered our liquidity and sold 9.7 million shares, raising $305 million in gross proceeds under our ATM via the forward. Currently, we have approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity comprised of $515 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31, $683 million of estimated proceeds available under our outstanding forwards, and $2.3 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility.\n In addition, our revolving credit facility has an accordion option, allowing us to request additional lender commitments of up to $1 billion. As we sit here today, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current macro environment and do not need to raise any incremental capital.\n In terms of leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion. Our net debt to annualized first quarter adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, is approximately 5.4x, within our target leverage range of 5 to 5.5x. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.36%, taking into account our hedge portfolio, and a weighted average 6.8 years to maturity.\n Touching on the income statement, AFFO per share was $0.56 for the quarter, an increase of 6.1% compared to the $0.53 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue, and our margins continue to run strong, in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items.\n Our G&A was $16.2 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, and continues to be one of the lowest ratios in not only the triple net sector but across all REITs.\n Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2024 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. As we originally highlighted on our Q4 earnings call, AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024 is expected to be between $2.32 billion and $2.355 billion, or between $2.22 and $2.25 per diluted common share.\n As a reminder, our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any transactions that have not yet closed, interest income from any loans that do not have final draw structures, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions or items.\n And as we have previously mentioned, we recorded noncash CECL allowance on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused, and we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, Caitlin, we started funding that upon an announcement. And so that's an 18-odd-month development builds, but it's really the proceeds that are going into the Margaritaville Hotel to use to build the Margaritaville Hotel, excuse me. As John mentioned, the team was out there a week or so ago and saw the sports facilities that are ultimately part of our real estate that we do have the option to call in the future once everything is up and running and stabilized. But they are a best-in-class youth sports operator, and while there's no immediate intentions to grow, they are realizing the benefits of what they're creating and may have opportunities in the future to expand what they are successfully building in Kansas City. Just under that. That's right. Yes, Dan, it's David. Good to hear from you. No, we have a very thorough asset management loan administration process and we monitor both our tenants and our loan investments very closely. And we talk to, as John mentioned, we talk to the operators and we also talk to our borrowers, and they are not seeing any headwinds in terms of development completion or asset performance where we do have these loan investments. Michael, it's David. One of the things you should look at is the Venetian press release that they put out yesterday where they, ahead of a 25th anniversary of the asset this Saturday, actually, where they have laid out extensive value enhancement plans well in excess of $700 million actually.  So it's just a little bit of timing on their side as they work through the initial $400 million this year. They've got a lot of things in the hopper and things that they've already done. And then just a bit of as that all comes together, what their pace of potentially drawing that incremental $300 million, where that falls in and how they use that capital going forward. Greg, I can start, and John can maybe chime in. Yes, potentially, there could be more than $700 million that comes out of our agreement here. The original $1 billion announcement back in 2022, we modified that as the team worked through and got in under the hood, so to speak, of the asset and realize what they wanted to do or what they want to undertake. So there's some tweaks to the original agreement on our side. And as Ed just laid out, the announcement that The Venetian put out yesterday has up to $1.5 billion or their plan is to invest $1.5 billion into the assets. So there could be incremental capital. But what we've documented and announced with our great partners at Apollo and Patrick and team and Rob into The Venetian is this incremental $700 million investment today.\n And to the second part of your question, there could be incremental dollars that we put in across the portfolio. It was because of the uniqueness of our assets versus any other REITs out there. No -- sorry, the first part of your -- around the draw schedules, Greg? I mean we still feel really good about our guidance -- sorry, go ahead. Yes, it's immaterial if there were any, so we feel really good about our guidance range where we sit here today."

            "name": "John W. Payne",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. Relationships are at the core of what we do at VICI and the quality of the relationships we have sets us apart. Our team works hard to strengthen existing ones and develop new ones so that we are best positioned for future growth opportunities, whether or not we are invited to what Ed has called the party. \n Our focus on trust in finding mutually beneficial solutions with our partners multiplies the beneficial impact of each relationship and we believe lays the groundwork for future growth through both good and bad market environments. One of the best examples of this is our relationship with Apollo and the team at The Venetian. The opportunity to acquire The Venetian originated during the COVID pandemic, another period of uncertainty with a challenging market backdrop.\n Since that time, the team at The Venetian has outperformed all expectations as Las Vegas has continued to solidify itself as the entertainment center of the world. We are thrilled to further expand our close relationship with Apollo and announced our opportunity to invest up to $700 million at The Venetian through VICI's Partner Property Growth Fund. This capital investment will fund several projects that seek to improve the overall guest experience and enhance the value of the property.\n The impact of our increasingly dynamic Las Vegas has continued to accrue to the benefit of The Venetian since we acquired the property together with Apollo in 2022, particularly with the neighboring Sphere, events like F1 and Super Bowl and an active convention schedule. The Venetian is set to celebrate its 25th anniversary this Saturday, and we're thrilled to partner with Apollo once again in their efforts to maximize the economic potential of this amazing iconic Strip asset.\n Gaming remains at VICI's core with over 98% of rent coming from our gaming partners, and the sector remains broadly healthy from a tenant credit perspective. Las Vegas continues to enjoy healthy growth with GGR up low single digits following the Super Bowl this quarter, and that is on top of an already impressive baseline, given gaming revenue increased 12% in the first quarter of 2023 over 2022.\n Since the market emerged from the pandemic, there has been 12 straight quarters, I'm going to repeat that, there has been 12 straight quarters of GGR growth in Las Vegas. Additionally, Las Vegas visitation numbers were up 4.2% in the first quarter, demonstrating the continued diversity of the revenue streams and the vast array of consumers enjoying this amazing city. In fact, based on a recent study from the University of Toronto that evaluated North American cities pre and post pandemic, Las Vegas is the only city that has surpassed pre-pandemic unique visitation numbers.\n In the regional gaming markets, while we recognize idiosyncratic weather headwinds this winter, we believe fundamentals remain sound, and we see steady consumer discretionary spend driven by the middle and high-end consumers on the casino floor. Although interest rate volatility has impacted transaction volume in the gaming market, we are active in dialogue around real estate opportunities in the gaming sector. Outside of our embedded growth pipeline, our relationships and gaming focus put us in a strong position when transactions or opportunities to invest in our existing properties arise.\n We continue to monitor the performance of Harrah's Hoosier Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis, for which we have a call right to acquire the real estate and buildings of these unique assets. This call right expires at the end of 2024 and we continue to work through the process with the appropriate Indiana regulatory agencies to gain the necessary gaming approvals should we elect to execute this option. \n VICI is also well positioned for incremental opportunities outside the gaming space as we've continued to expand our scope and our TAM of investments. We are committed to ensuring that each experiential sector and potential partner meets our investment criteria of low cyclicality, low secular threat, improving track record of growth and favorable supply and demand dynamics.\n In January of this year, VICI expanded its investment in the youth sports sector with the announcement of the up to $105 million construction loan agreement with affiliates of Homefield Kansas City to fund the development of a Margaritaville resort that will be embedded within Homefield's broader youth sports complex. The youth sports training center hosted 115 teams this last weekend for a basketball tournament and the baseball facility is open and in use. The Margaritaville resort is expected to be completed in 2025. Having visited the area a few weeks ago, I can tell you all the facilities are truly amazing.\n The Homefield partnership adds to our youth sports investment, as Ed said, which we initiated with our 2020 mortgage loan to Chelsea Piers in New York City. And at the end of 2023, we acquired the leasehold interest in the property and converted the initial loan into real estate ownership.\n While REITs were broadly excluded from, as Ed put it, the party that took place in the first quarter of 2024, the effects of the transactions and relationships announced at the end of last year and the beginning of this year contributed to our 6.1% growth in AFFO per share. As I stated earlier, our relationships are at the foundation of our business and drive our growth. Our standard for prudent underwriting gives us confidence in our roster of existing partners with whom we believe we have many growth opportunities. We look forward to developing new relationships with best-in-class operators so that VICI can continue to grow its quality experiential real estate portfolio.\n Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results and guidance. David? I will start, and I'll start first in our portfolio in Las Vegas because I think that's been a real center of where we've grown our company, and we have great operators there. We obviously announced The Venetian today, and you heard in my opening remarks that I believe, and maybe I'm a little bit biased, but this is the fastest-growing or the best city in hospitality in the world as it continues to attract a wide variety of consumers. So that provides opportunities for our partners, whether that's MGM, Caesars, we announced with Venetian. We've got a partner in Hard Rock that owns the Mirage that are all studying ways to continue to reinvent their business and add additional amenities to these amazing assets.\n The beauty of the assets in Las Vegas is the magnitude of opportunities that they have and the magnitude of square footage that they have in these assets to continue to not only remodel, but there are large parts of these assets that are unused at this time that could be brought either back to life or have never been in life with new concepts. So I can't give you any details that we haven't announced, but our operators have all talked about the development of their Las Vegas assets.\n Outside Las Vegas, there are some regional markets that continue to grow. We own some of the best assets out there, and we continue to talk to our partners about how we could potentially use our capital to grow their businesses. And we've announced previously some opportunities with Century, and I think there'll be some opportunities with some of our larger and our smaller operators. So Ed, I'll start with that if you want to add anything to that answer. Tony, I don't think that's necessary. It's funny. First of all, it's funny we still call them the Centaur assets. It is Harrah's Hoosier Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis. We do the same the same thing. But no, Tony, I mean we're going through the process with the appropriate Indiana regulatory agencies. And should we elect to execute this option, we will make sure that we follow all the rules and the regulations. But to your question about timing, really no position on that other than we're going through and spending the appropriate time with those agencies. Barry, can I add just one thing to that. Not only are -- do I agree 100% with Ed on the assets, it's also the operators that run these assets, that they are constantly looking at ways to attract more consumers and to generate more business. So you can have a great asset, but if the operator doesn't want to change it and wants to sit on their hands, the gaming operators, particularly in Las Vegas, are the best in the world in the hospitality space, and they are constantly looking at ways to build, reinvent their business. And so those 2 things combined, not only the assets are incredible, but having operators that want to change and grow and innovate is a formula for us to be able to continue to grow with the Property Growth Fund. It continues to remain -- it's the same, Barry. Ed, do you want me to take that? Yes. John, so let's talk a little bit about all the different areas of Las Vegas. So today, we have an incredible amount of assets in -- on The Strip. We have 10 assets on the Las Vegas Strip that we're very excited about. Where we do not have any investments yet, where we see potential for growth is in the regional market of Las Vegas and in the downtown market of Las Vegas. So you could see VICI continue to grow in the Las Vegas market, and it could be on The Strip, but it also could be in these other areas. And those are great segments of the business that we simply don't have real estate or partners yet along the way.\n So -- and then I think you also asked about the Mirage and our work with -- we continue to speak with the Hard Rock team who's running the Mirage on ways that we can help them grow, but we have not made any announcement on that yet, John. Yes, Smedes, good to talk to you. Probably a better question for the operating side of our business or the operators, but I'll give it a go here a little bit. In my comments, we're about in the regional markets, like you said, the middle and the high-end consumers are still coming in their frequency based on the information from our tenants. I think you're asking or do we believe that those lower segments will come back. I think that really depends on the operator. Is the operator pulling back incentives to those consumers and they've elected not to come because they find more ways to spend their marketing dollars in a more efficient way? So again, more an operator conversation.\n But Smedes, again, you're asking how does that affect VICI?  As I always like to say, and you know this well, even with every casino closed in the world during the pandemic, VICI collected 100% of our rent on time and in cash. So if segments of the business see a little bit of a downturn, not even negative, VICI is going to collect our rent or historically has collected our rent. \n So we monitor these things. I stay on top of it because I'm a recovering operator, but in the core business of what we do, those downturns, upturns don't have a huge change in our look at the business. We look much more big picture, longer-term, years out. Does that make sense, Smedes? Samantha. Michael, it's nice to talk to you this morning. And we agree that this is a win-win for both companies. You initially asked when did these discussions started. They actually started when we initially did the lease back in -- during the pandemic. And when we bought the real estate with Apollo or we bought the real estate and they bought the operation of Venetian, we knew that they were going to grow the business. We didn't know they were going to grow it as fast as they hadn't been so successful there, and we're very, very proud of them. But we talked about the Property Growth Fund and where there could be opportunities for us to grow.  So the discussion started, and we do this often when we're doing deals to not only think about the deal that's in front of us, but where there are opportunities for us to grow, particularly with great assets like The Venetian.\n And then as it comes to the pricing, like anything, we -- since we started the company, we tried to create beneficial deals for both sides. If one side kind of wins, it's not great for a long-term relationship. So I opened up my remarks today and I -- someone may have rolled their eyes about that this is about relationships, but it really is about relationships. And when you can look across the table from a good partner, you get to a price that they feel good about, we feel good about and the transaction happens. And as you said, it's been a win-win, and we're just excited to help them add these great new amenities and upgrade the amenities that they have. Yes, Greg, I think you should hear that we like these opportunities. And as Ed just pointed out a few minutes ago, there aren't many REITs that have this unique lever to pull to grow. I mean there aren't many REITs that are going to say, \"Hey, we're going to put $700 million into an asset.\" There are some REITs that can't even say I want to put $700 million into my whole portfolio. We're talking one of our 93 assets. So we like this opportunity to help our partners grow, and that's one of the uniqueness that VICI has that we have the -- and we were talking earlier, we can go to M&A. We can help buy other assets, but we also have this lever that we've been talking about for years that is coming to life today with The Venetian. We continue to spend time... Yes, we continue to spend time in a lot of different sectors on the non-gaming side, whether that's wellness, indoor water parks, pilgrimage golf, youth sports, you've heard us make an investment. But at the same time, let's remember, as I said in my opening remarks, we get 98% of our rent from our gaming assets, and we continue to spend time with our current partners and others to grow. So for us, I know we get asked a fair amount about our non gaming, but it shouldn't be forgotten that we're also spending a lot of time in gaming. So the answer is both, spending time in both."
