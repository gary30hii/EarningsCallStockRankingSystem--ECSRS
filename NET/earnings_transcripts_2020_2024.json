Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew. \nMatthew Prince: Thank you Jason. We had an excellent quarter to top off a remarkable year. We achieved $125.9 million in revenue of 50% year-over-year. For the year our revenue was a bit over $430 million up 50% over 2019. I wanted to pause and thank all our team at Cloudflare for the hard work that resulted in another year of extraordinary growth. Beyond revenue are other business metrics in the quarter were very strong. Our paying customer account grew to over a 111,000 up 10% quarter-over-quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in several years. Large customers those that spend over a hundred thousand dollars per year with us continue to be our strongest growth area adding 92 new customers in Q4 and bringing our total large customer account to 828. Revenue from these large customers increased sequentially to 49% up from 47% in Q3 as our sales team continues to close larger and larger enterprise accounts. As you look across customer segments by side our large customer segment is growing the fastest. This is because of new logo wins and also because our land and expand motion is picking up steam. We saw initial evidence of this earlier in the year but are now seeing it reflected in lagging indicators like dollar-based net retention which increased 300 basis points sequentially to 119% in Q4. While there may be some volatility in that number going forward I'm encouraged that when you dig into what's behind that improvement it's being driven primarily by customer adoption of our expanding product portfolio. In particular we're seeing more of our existing customers adopt cloud corporate teams our zero trust network security solution as well as Magic Transit. Customers see that they can use the full range of Cloudflare's products to achieve the corporate network of the future. This is the vision we articulate with Cloudflare 1 and it's resonating with customers. In other words our sales team is more successful in part because our R&D teams keep delivering more products and features our customers need. Innovation is the energy the fuels Cloudflare. One thing that kept coming up over the course of the quarter was how our pace of innovation is cabinet for developers. This is something I plan to talk more about tomorrow at our Investor Day but to give you a preview from our earliest days developers were our core audience. We made it easy for them to sign up and get started using our services without having to go through a traditional sales process. If the feature didn't work exactly how they wanted we let them have full control through our workers development platform and while we augment our developer first sign-up process with a terrific sales team every product we launch is designed to be adopted by developers first. One way of measuring this is the rate at which developers are adopting our Cloudflare workers edge computing platform. In Q4 more than 50,000 new developers wrote and deployed their first Cloudflare worker. That rate of new developers building on workers for the first time in a quarter has more than doubled since we last reported it in Q2. But it's not just workers that brings developers to Cloudflare platforms. That's why one of my favorite stories from the quarter was not one of our biggest wins on a dollar basis but rather one that I think evidences how developers see the broader Cloudlflare platform.  The engineering team at one of the leading software companies themselves building tools for developers approached us about better securing their own development environment. This project wasn't imposed by the IT organization from the top down but instead led by developers of the company from the bottom up. They knew having seen increasing threats and attacks like the one that impacted solar wind they needed better access control. They led the process define the best solution and they chose CloudFlare access, part of our Cloudflare team suite in our conversations with them one seemed kept coming up. Cloudflare is the only company with a zero trust solution that really understands and is built for the needs of developers. It's a 70,000 annual deal to start and we expect we'll be able to grow with this customer but I think it's an indication of something more important. Developers are the future of IT and having won their trust we expect will help us win, retain and expand more and more customers over time. To that end here are some of our more traditional big wins for the quarter. A Fortune 500 oil and gas conglomerate signed a three-year $1 million deal to implement a portion of our Cloudflare 1 architecture including Magic Transit, DDOS mitigation, firewall and DNS, replace spend they had with legacy telecom providers. They had faced serious technical challenges trying to integrate the telecoms network services with third-party offerings. We also beat out a number of point cloud solutions. The customer appreciated our ease of use, technical innovation and the way multiple products fit together into a unified solution. A fortune 500 U.S. financial provider signed a three-year $1.6 million deal to replace legacy telecom spends and moved towards the Cloudflare 1 architecture. They were particularly impressed with our product roadmap and our pace of innovation. Sticking with financial services for a second a Fortune 500 Asian financial services company signed a four-year $8.5 million deal with us. They too are implementing our Cloudflare 1 architecture to modernize their corporate network. While we often win deals that are driven by developer team this is an example of a classic IT led RFP our sales team engaged with the customer, built the relationship and won the business. As part of the win our solutions engineering team was able to use our Cloudflare workers platform to seamlessly migrate the customer from their previous provider. A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company leaning into their Cloudflare implementation further adopting the Cloudflare 1 architecture. They signed a $450,000 per year deal to add our Magic Transit service. The company had received the threat from a hacker targeting their network. We received a call from the customer on a Friday and had them onboarded over the weekend. I think this speaks both to the nimbleness of our solution and also to the fact that when existing customers have security needs Cloudflare is increasingly their first call. A fortune 500 semiconductor provider signed a three-year $1.4 million deal to replace a legacy network provider. The buyer appreciated our technical innovation, the way our products seamlessly work together and our performance. They said their previous fender solution \u201cworks but it's clunky and slow with bolted on parts\u201d as for Cloudflare he described this as \u201cmuch more agile\u201d and \u201cthe company of the future\u201d that really made me smile. A fortune 1000 enterprise software provider signed a three-year $2.6 million deal to implement Cloudflare across their organization. They initially came to us in order to improve their performance in China something they struggled to be able to do with any other provider. They were also impressed with our workers edge computing platform. They are fast growing technically savvy organization and we look forward to growing with them on their path to joining our other Fortune 500 customers. Before I hand it over to Thomas I wanted to take a second to reflect back on 2020. It was a remarkable year for Cloudflare for the internet and well for all of humanity. We were proud to be there when the world needed the internet more than ever before. Helping our customers shift to remote work ensuring the network itself could scale to handle a massive increase in traffic providing the Athenian project and Cloudflare for campaigns to ensure cyber attacks didn't disrupt the 2020 election and most recently launching project Fair Shot to help governments municipalities, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies around the world more fairly distribute the COVID-19 vaccine. As one of the hundreds of organizations that has reached out to implement project Fair Shot said the other day \u201cCloudflare has literally helped save lives\u201d. It was incredible to watch our team rapidly build the technology behind project Fair Shot on our workers platform and deploy it at tremendous scale in a matter of weeks. We're incredibly proud of how our technology and expertise helped make a challenging year a little bit better. But it wasn't easy. We had to shift to working remotely while continuing to recruit, hire, innovate, deliver, scale and sell our services. While there were some tailwinds there were a lot of headwinds too. In April for instance traffic grew across our network more in two weeks than we had expected it to over two years. That put pressure on our business. Less than 5% of our revenue comes from usage-based products. So when traffic spikes our associated cost spikes but our revenue doesn't automatically follow. Now customers love the predictability of this. The last thing anyone wanted in 2020 was a surprise bill and our consistent pricing is one of the things that differentiates us but that means our team has to do the hard work; renegotiating bandwidth agreements, inventing new technologies and continuing to wring out every penny of efficiency. That's why I was particularly impressed that our gross margin was 78.1% in Q4 it's actually down 60 basis points year-over-year. I'm proud of the fact however that we could do all the things to keep the internet working the way it needed to in 2020 and it only cost us 60 basis points. We didn't raise prices on our customers when they needed us most. We didn't sacrifice the quality of our service. We did what we do, invented new technology and got more efficient and going in 2021 look out we're a lean, mean innovation machine and we have no intention of slowing down. With that I'll turn it over to Thomas.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you Matthew and thank you to everyone for joining us. Well, it has been a year of challenges I'm extremely proud of our team's performance and unrelenting execution in serving our customers in global communities with an outstanding fourth quarter where we again exceeded the high end of our guidance wrapping up an exceptional year across the board. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 50% year-over-year to $125.9 million. Total revenue for fiscal 2020 also increased 50% year-over-year to $431.1 million. Since 2016 we've grown at a compound annual growth rate of 50% demonstrating our continued growth at scale. From a geographic perspective we saw noteworthy strengths in the U.S. and EMEA. The U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 54% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 60% year-over-year. The Asia-Pacific represented 16% of revenue and increased 33% year-over-year. As you know [indiscernible] signed a three-year deal last year to build out 150 points of presence in China and we excited to say that the relationship is off to an excellent start. I do renew this contract in the fourth quarter for the next six months. We're in the process of transitioning from Baidu to JD is our primary partner in China. This transition might result in temporary short-term headwinds to growth in that region. Expanding internationally remains a priority. We open three new international offices in 2020. The first in Tokyo, followed by Paris and Toronto. With our inverted go to market strategy we invest behind the demand we are seeing and the success of the customers we acquire helping to remove risks as we continue to expand internationally. Turning to our customer metrics. We exited the quarter with more than $3.5 million total free and paying customers representing an increase of 38% year-over-year. In Q4 we had a record quarter of paying customer editions adding over 10,000 paying customers sequentially and over 27,000 paying customers year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 111,183 paying customers representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. The acceleration in paying customer growth was primarily driven by increased new product adoption from free to paying customers. We ended the quarter with 828 large customers which we defined as paying customers with greater than a $100,000 in annualized revenue representing an increase of 57% year-over-year. We added 92 large customers sequentially and over 300 in 2020. We saw significant expansion from our large enterprise customers which helped to drive a dollar based net retention rate of 119% representing a 3 point increase sequentially. Our enterprise total market efforts generated significant ROI which we look forward to providing additional insight on during our investor day tomorrow. Efficiency remains at the core of our business and is demonstrated in the consistently high gross margin we generate from growing revenue and in the low CapEx we need to deploy and build out the footprint and capacity of our network. Fourth quarter gross margin was 78.1% representing an increase of 80 bases points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 9% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 12% for the year in line with the guidance shared last quarter. We expect to see continued variability in how we deploy network traffic over the year but we expect that we'll continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue. Turning to the operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased 18% year-over-year to 82%. We had another strong hiring quarter with an increase of 41% year-over-year bringing our total number of employees to 1788 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $58.2 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 46% from 52% in the same quarter last year. We continue to invest in our go-to-market efforts to add sales capacity and expand our global footprint. Research and development expenses were $25.7 million in the quarter. R&D as the percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially and decreased to 20% from 26% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $19.9 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and decreased to 16% from 22% in the same quarter last year. Scaling our business efficiently remains a top priority and we continue to see strong operating leverage in the fourth quarter with operating margin improving 1750 basis points year-over-year. Operating loss was $5.5 million compared to $18.3 million in the same period last year. Net loss in the quarter was $7.4 million to a net loss per share of $0.02. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 28%. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $23.5 million or 19% of revenue compared to negative $23.5 million or 28% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was negative $8.8 million in the fourth quarter or 7% of revenue which decreased $10.8 million sequentially in a slight decrease of roughly $200,000 year-over-year. The Q4 decrease in operating cash flow was driven primarily by an increase in DSO due to seasonality. Collections, however, have come in strong in January. We expect to see some level of variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital, the growth in our large enterprise business and seasonal factors. Additionally, we expect to see cash flow impacts due to investments and leasehold improvements as we think towards the future of how we use our offices and reinvent our spaces to support a new hybrid work environment. Before moving to guidance for the first quarter and full year I would like to provide a brief update on COVID related impacts and associated provisions we shared last quarter. Throughout 2020 we've disclosed the percentage of revenue represented by customers in COVID macro-sensitive industries such as transportation, hospitality and retail. This cohort represented 8% of revenue in the first quarter, 7% in the second and third quarter and we are pleased to share that this percentage remain consistent at 7% in the fourth quarter. Customer concessions and bad debts also came in well below expectations again this quarter and have remained consistent with historical levels. In Q4 we saw another strong quarter of new ACV growth increasing average customer spend in high sales productivity. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO rpo remains strong in Q4 coming in at $384 million representing an increase of 12% sequentially and 75% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. Given the strong growth and momentum we are seeing we remain optimistic about the demand for our product and confident in the continued growth of our business. As such we are pleased to again raise our outlook for both the quarter and full year. For the first quarter we expect revenue in the range of $130 million to $131 million representing an increase of 42% to 44% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $9 million to $8 million and we expect net loss per share in the range of $0.03 to $0.02 assuming approximately 306 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of negative 20%. For the full year 2021 we expect revenue in the range of $589 million to $593 million representing an increase of 37% to 38% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $25 million to $21 million and we expect net loss per share over that period in the range of $0.09 to $0.08 assuming approximately 309 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2021 of negative 60%. In closing, it was another very strong quarter closing out an extraordinary year. I again want to thank our employees for delivering these great results and for their continued dedication. We hope to see many of you tomorrow as we'll be hosting our first Investor Day where we look forward to sharing a detail on our products and platform as well as providing an update on our financial progress and targets. And with that I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator please call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of the Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nPhil Winslow: Hey thanks guys for taking my question. Congrats on a great closer really this great year. In a quarter where a lot of numbers obviously jumped off the page the one that really stood out to us was the customer account the 10,000 plus that were added quarter to quarter and Q4 I mean that's almost as many as you added in all of 2019. What if you provide us you just more color on what's driving that? Is the new products like teams? Is it sort of area of your products that like security driving that just more color on that would be awesome and just have one follow-up.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Phil thanks for the question. We were very excited to see that the paying customer count was up as strong as it was and that's our strongest quarter-over-quarter growth we've had in some time. I think there's not one specific thing that I would point to. I think that we've built what is a strong machine sort of a strong horse plowing through a snow field, a quiet field if you will but I think that we're always looking for ways that we can get either our existing customers that are on the free version of our service to pay us or to get more people to come into the funnel. And so I think there are three different areas that I would point out. The first is that our total customer account had really strong performance as we saw people just adopting Cloudflare as a whole a lot of those customers start out as free customers and migrate up but some percentage will start as paying customers from day one and so as the total customer account grows it was the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth we had in in all of 2020 last quarter as well and that total customer account. That feeds that. I think the second thing was we launched a new feature which we call Automatic Platform Optimization or APO that had real appeal for a lot of our existing free customers where they could with one click of a button and a payment to us get substantial improvement on especially Wordpress driven sites. And so I think that that drove some potential additional attention and additional usage and then we also saw some of the customers that were using the free versions of our teams product and if you remember at the beginning of the pandemic we made Cloudfare for teams a free product. A lot we had very good very strong conversion of that and that translated into paying customers some of which showed up in the quarter. So I think it was those three things plus us just continuing to execute and again really proud of our team.\nPhil Winslow: Great and then just to follow up on that both Thomas and you highlighted gross margin not just this quarter but this year and really kind of a case study so to speak of converting variable cost to fixed or no cost but I kind of want to take the other side of that sort of using it as a competitive weapon versus other players in the space that might charge on a variable basis. Do you think about using that in \u201821 and beyond sort of as a way to think about displacements talking to folks who maybe have these variable spikes and then had obviously variable change in their cost to their providers. How do you think about using sort of your fixed or no cost model as sort of what weapon in terms of competitive placement.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, we had seen for quite some time that there is a lot of angst over that surprise bill that variable based billing leads to and I think that especially as you are trying to sell service like a security service if you get a cyber attack and all of a sudden you get a bigger bill from your provider than the provider not much different than the attacker themselves, both of them are costing you and so from the beginning we really believed that it was important to keep our port services on a fixed predictable basis and so team that we were hearing already in Q4 and coming through now into Q1 is that company after the craziness of 2020 are looking for a level of predictability and we definitely see our ability to use our strong gross margin performance to potentially display some of those providers that really surprise customers over the course of 2020.\nThomas Seifert: What I would add is I mean there two really good examples that all come to my mind where you can see, how we can use margin as strategic weapon one more [indiscernible] for the very first time, you saw this last year when we gave our team\u2019s product await for free for pretty much most of the year and then we had other products when we supported the election platform so, we have done that in the past and this will be [indiscernible] stay with that strategy moving forward.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJames Fish: Hey guys congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. Matthew you actually just mentioned the free to paid conversion of teams is strong. Can you guys provide any more colors to really how much of that free base you've now converted versus kind of what's left to go chase in \u201821 and any other new kind of pipeline you've got in Q4 for teams.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So I think that we have two different ways that we look at that. So there first of all there have been companies that started out on a small portion of their team using that team's product and so that the team's product grows naturally with the number of steeps that adopt it and so our team right now is focused on a lot of we had a lot of success which we talked about last quarter in converting those free customers to being paying customers and now I think what we're trying to do largely for those is take them from being small customers and grow them into larger and larger customers over time. And so that's one bit of focus. I think we have continued to try to be really empathetic to the customers that continue to be in either industries or segments that are tough and so we have continued to extend for those businesses that are still being hampered by the pandemic, their payment terms and continue to extend that free offer. We want to be focused on the long term and we think we're building a relationship with those customers, the feedback is that they're very positive and well that's a small percentage of that overall base that's something which we do think there's opportunity around but the bigger one is we think that once an organization starts using the team's product and we make that super easy for them to use for a small part of their organization that gives us an opportunity to really expand that product over time and that's really where our team is focused. \nJames Fish: Makes sense and on the go to market side you list off a lot of wins especially with Cloudflare 1 this quarter. Our reps leading with this or the individual solutions that still kind of comprise it and just any sense of how much of new bookings that really drove this quarter?\nMatthew Prince: Yes I think that it depends. I think that the usual motion to adopting the full Cloudflare 1 suite remains that a customer will come to us with a very specific need. They will need to put in new access controls around some of their applications or services. They will need to defend against a new vulnerability or cyber threat that they've become aware of but once we get into the selling motion what we see is that customers really care about the overall platform and how it fits together and that's what Cloudflare 1 represents and one of the things that Thomas will be talking about tomorrow during our investor day is how we have continued to see real strength in getting customers not just to adopt any one solution or any one product of ours but to adopt that overall solution and as we talked about in our IPO what we think about is that once a customer is using four or more of our products it's very-very difficult to compete with us because of the broad suite and so we are definitely working with customers to try to get them to that four more number and Thomas we'll talk about tomorrow a little bit more of the success we've had doing that.\nJames Fish: That's very helpful. Thanks guys. Congrats.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Matthew you mentioned the largest customer segment is growing the fastest. I'm curious if you could shed a little more light on that topic and for Thomas just tying into that when you look at the quarter carrying reps that you'll add to meet the demand you're seeing in this large enterprise build out into \u201821 are you accelerating your growth? Are you digesting some of the [indiscernible] that you made last year to address this segment of the market? Thank you very much.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks Brent. So I'll start and then and Thomas can add more color. So the first thing is and again not to have to keep plugging Thomas's segment tomorrow but I was just looking over the slide and we're going to provide a lot more color on exactly how the various customer segments are working and how the growth at the strongest then and the largest customers is the fastest growing portion of our business. I think that's driven by two different things. I think the half of that is coming from our increasing ability at landing big deals early and so we are seeing more and more that when there is a sort of traditional multi-million dollar RFI or RFP which is submitted that we have the team to be able to respond to that and win those deals and the product is in place and we're winning more of those deals at the very beginning and I think that's a really good sign. I think the other part is a really good sign is that our land and expand motion continues to pick up steam and we're seeing more customers grow into those larger categories and again tomorrow Thomas will provide more clarity on that but I think that what we see across our entire organization is that we're adding the support in order to really make sure that those customers have a terrific experience and that means bringing on great sales people. We're not one of the companies that believe that you can get away without having sales people. If you have customers who are spending $1 million to $10 million with you they want to have someone that they can really build a relationship with and so tomorrow we will outline a lot of some of those sales leaders who have joined our team and the really incredible kind of enterprise DNA that they're bringing with us and I think that's making us a better and better company.\nThomas Seifert: [indiscernible] your second question [indiscernible] heavily insert last year in terms [indiscernible] reps but also leadership with higher great talent. I think the real positive over the last year was that we are able to keep our failed productivity extremely high both in terms of our on-board people and [indiscernible]. But also in terms of how much they retire once they ramped on. And we will continue to invest into capacity and moving into this year. I think we always said that our commitment to send salesman marketing both continuous longer returns though it\u2019s a period of [indiscernible] and really balanced successfully and [indiscernible] outstanding job and will continue to peruse this path for this year too.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Very very nice quarter. Very nice year. I disagree with my colleague I think the most impressive number I saw on the page was that expansion in, dollar expansion rate up to [190] I think it really highlights both kind of your retention has remained rock solid and you've been expanding really well within particular with those large customers. Can you talk to us a little bit about it may help us sort of understand the quantification of when a customer is buying Cloudflare 1 and getting the whole platform what kind of upload do you see on a typical customer when they're kind of going all in with the platform?\nPhil Winslow: Yes Keith, I really \u2013[indiscernible] \u2013 [audio gap] pretty conservative dollar-based net retention definition. And I think that's been something that we\u2019ve grown [Indiscernible]. What I think is important to know is that it's a real indication of how our R&D\u2019s ability to deliver new products, really supplements the ability for our sales team to be able to shell more to our customers over time. And so what we're seeing is that with half of our teams and with the broader sort of definition of -- one that that we're able to go to customers and get them to oftentimes significantly increase their spend with Cloudflare. And then over time, expensive Cloudflare products are sold based on fee based. We think that they will be able to continue to expand with them over time in ways that many of our traditional products haven't been. So we're excited about this and we do some significance from it. And I think that that's something that we have to really track in a mode of response.\nUnidentified Analyst: I made an assumption in the question that the question that the retention rate was remaining solid. Can you give us some visibility in terms of that expansion the net dollar expansion rate, are you? Is this only on the up sell portion or is there any change in the underlying kind of gross retention? \nMatthew Prince: Yes, we\u2019ve had some very strong number for quite some time. And I don\u2019t think that there is anything, there hasn\u2019t been anything that has changed that underlying gross retention number it\u2019s continued to trend at a very strong level and so most of the improvement in dollar based net retention is actually in our ability to better upsell to customers.\nUnidentified Analyst: You saw an impact pipeline perhaps could it lead to more free teams conversion just sort of curious on that aspect. I have to imagine you guys are a pretty good spot to help a lot of your customers and potential future customers with those sorts of issues. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. And as a reminder, please make sure that your lines are not on speaker phone when asking questions. Mr. Hedberg, your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks so much guys and congrats on the quarter and really the year. I wanted to ask about the SolarWind or SUNBURST breach. Kind of curious if you saw the impact pipeline, perhaps could it be two more three teams conversion, just sort of curious on that aspect, that have to \u2013 had a previous spot to help a lot of your customers and potential future customers with those special issues?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks Matt. I think it's early for us to be able to indicate clearly whether that had a significant impact yet. I think that the first thing that was the question that we got from our customers was were we impacted? And the answer was no, we weren't SolarWind customer. I think the more important thing and a story that I think that the market is waking up to is how a zero trust approach to security like the one that Cloudflare can help with really acts almost as almost bulk heads in a ship. There are going to be flaws in software overtime and SolarWind was impacted this time but the real challenge is that because an attacker was able get them through SolarWind, they were then able to once they were in move across the entire organization and that is a symptom of the previous sort of castle and mode approach. Once you find one more across one mode, you have access in higher capital. And that\u2019s talent whereas I think the real, the real brilliance of a zero cost approach is that it put those natural bulkheads in place, so that if there is some sort of breach in one part of an organization, then the attacker then can\u2019t move laterally across the rest of that. And so that\u2019s the main that we have implemented as our own security systems and it allowed us to very quickly not only verify that we weren\u2019t using SolarWinds anywhere at Cloudflare but then also they really do an assessment then, there was nothing else that they created an issue for it. And I think also when we sell our Cloudflare for teams our products to customers this idea they much more modern zero trust approach to security is reasonating. And so I think SolarWind is one instance where it\u2019s going to be a tailwind to sell more zero trust approaches and we think that our zero trust approach is not only the most developer friendly and the most effective that\u2019s out there and I think overtime that will lead to more and more customers for it.\nMatt Hedberg: That's great. Thank you. And then Thomas mentioned in the script that it sounds like in six months you're going to be migrating away from Baidu to JD.com. Sort of curious on the thought process there and I think he also mentioned that there could be a slight headwind. Just wondering is there any more clarification on what that might mean and really what the rationale is ultimately the end of the day on that decision? Thank you. \nMatthew Prince: Yes. So one of the things I think is unique about Cloudflare is that we provide a truly global network that has extended extends around the entire world including into China. And so for our customers that care about performance in China this is a way for us to be able to give them a unified platform and that was a pretty, it was a pretty ambitious goal for us to set out on and we set out on a journey with Baidu in 2014 to build that one unified network and for them to be our partner in China. They have been a terrific partner to us over the course of the last six plus years and we appreciate everything that they have done in order to help us do that. We wanted to upgrade the network in China and really make it something that was going to be even more performant and dramatically increased the presence that we had and so we went out looking at see whether it was Baidu or JD or who would be our partner for what we hope will be another six plus year relationship. And the team at JD really impressed us both in terms of their technical acumen and their ability to help us really build out what is an extensive network across what is often a very complicated region for both technical and other regions. And so over the course of the next three years we're working with JD to build out over 150 points of presence in China alone. We'll be able to have our customers opt in to using that if they want and we can also generate revenue as JD sells the rest of our global network to customers elsewhere. As we transition off, there was a payment that was coming from Baidu in the past for us. That will diminish and where we have a payment that comes from JD that picks to pick some of that up but in the meantime that transition there may be some headwind. We don't think it's going to be material and it's all baked into our existing guide. \nMatt Hedberg: Thanks so much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open. \nAmit Daryanani: Hey. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess two for me as well first off was hoping if you could maybe talk about how do you think about product deployment versus product development in calendar 21 because if I think about the last 12 months the velocity of new product launch is fairly impressive. I can't imagine how much the time has expanded since the ipo but as you think about calendar 21 do should we think about this new product innovation to sustain the same cadence or do you think we spend more time scaling these products up to further increase your wallet share with customers? \nMatthew Prince: Yes thanks for the question. And I think that our rate of innovation is something that Cloudflare was really designed for and it's something that I'm going to be talking a lot about at the investor day tomorrow about how we do that. We have no intention of slowing down our rate of innovation and so I think that you will see a series of product weeks that will be very similar to what you saw in 2020 with really great launches across that. That will include both taking products that we have announced and are currently in beta and moving them into GA and so we're excited about some of the extensions to our workers platform being generally available things like durable objects and making that something that people can sink their teeth into and really work on and the early feedback from the beta users has been terrific. But it also means us thinking about dreaming up new ways to take our network and deliver more value to that and so I think that 90% of our product and engineering organization is really focused on how do we take our existing products, take feedback from our users and continuously make those better like a traditional product organization. But we have this one team which we call ETI for Emerging Technology and Incubation which is about 10% of our R&D efforts who are really thinking about how do we dream up what is over the horizon and they they are not slowing down and I think that a lot of the things that plus over teams products and customer one for example are graduating out of ETI into our traditional product organization and that frees up some headroom for them to start thinking about what are the next products that are going to shake the industry 18 months from now. \nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for that and if I could just follow up but as I think about the calendar 21 revenue guide and I really appreciate you folks have been giving us a guide at this point. We did 50% plus revenue growth this year in calendar 20. I think the midpoint of the guide implies 37% growth in 21. What are the factors that are driving that solid deceleration in 21?\nThomas Seifert: Well let me get started then Matthew joins in. We observed as well last year in times of uncertainty to be thoughtful and prudent about the guidance that we provided for the year and I think we applied the same approach. We lean in more this year if you compare the guidance we give at the beginning of this year and compared to last year but we also have to recognize the numbers become bigger. There is a lot of large numbers and there is still uncertainty out there that has not diminished making guidance an easier topic as last year. So I think it's a prudent and thoughtful approach thinking through the opportunities but also weighing the risks that undoubtedly are still out there. \nMatthew Prince: I would just echo what Tom has said. And I think that we have tried to be very thoughtful throughout this year. I remember when we were back in April after our early May and after our Q1 guidance I mean we didn't know what the world was in store and I think there's a lot of uncertainty still out in the world and while we've seen an enormous amount of success and we're excited we want to be extremely prudent about how we think about the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver from Baird. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes. Thank you and congrats on the performance. So I have a two-part question on security. First can you talk about the opportunity you're seeing the cross-sell across the more traditional waft and health service products and the new offerings like access gateway and browser isolation? Just what what kind of success you're seeing there? Then the the follow on would be what is the impact to cost of goods when you thought about that security reverse and forward proxy use case? Is that a point of future leverage in the model? \nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks Jonathan for the two questions. I can take a stab at both and then Thomas may have something to add. So I think that we've been very pleasantly surprised at the way that there is a cross-sell opportunity from different products. I think the two that seem to go together like like peanut butter jelly for us have been our access product which is all about how do we secure the access to applications which are exposed to internal users and our WAFF and DDOS products. I think other competitors in the market often think that sort of access and gateway fit naturally together and we see that as well but there's really an opportunity and what we're seeing is that as people are adopting a zero trust approach that means exposing more applications to the internet and while access controls are important to that and internet gateways are important to that when those things get exposed to the internet they have traditional web application firewall concerns and they especially have DDOS mitigation concerns. And so those different products end up fitting very nicely together and customers like that they can manage all of their security needs through one pane of glass and that's I think something that is very differentiated in our products versus other products that are in the marketplace or trying to cobble together a number of different solutions in order to get what Cloudflare offers out of the box. Your second question I think is, it really goes to what is the other side of the same advantage that we have, which is that early on in Cloudflare history we made the determination that every single server everywhere across our network would run every single bit of our software and so that means that we can deploy as we need more capacity for one product or another the the network automatically adjusts to that and allows us to be able to adapt. What that also means is that for products that are sort of as you put it forward versus reverse proxies which is just a direction that traffic is flowing it turns out you only pay, when you're paying for bandwidth you only pay for the larger of kind of inverses out and so it can often be at least on a bandwidth basis, it can often be that we can add new products to a customer's overall bill without it significantly changing what our underlying cost infrastructure is. And I think that's part of the secret cost of how Cloudflare works because our product team is always looking at what are the excess resources that we have on our network and how can we deploy products in order to take advantage of those excess resources. And so as we add if we have a customer that's using our DDOS and WAFF if we get them to adopt access and gateway it doesn't meaningfully change our cost basis and that also means that we can be very competitive and especially on an ROI basis versus competitors and we can bundle products together in a very effective way.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you very much Matthew. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of James Breen from William Blair. Your line is open. \nJames Breen: Thanks for taking the question. Can you just give us a little more color on sort of how the revenue mix is split out and the successor had internationally relative to the U.S.? And I know you've talked a lot about sort of the architecture network helping from the compliance standpoint is the software's delivery. Can you talk about that as well? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Sure. I think that we had a very strong year in both the U.S. and Europe. Today the U.S. represents about 50% of our revenue and the rest of the world is the other 50% I think that Europe has had very strong growth and has really been a standout for some time. We had some, we were watching carefully especially as there were concerns around adoption of some U.S. technology companies and some of the privacy regulations but what I think you'd see in Q4 was we really leaned into the fact that Cloudflare is a privacy first organization and we saw that payoff in the results where more and more European customers are willing to adopt us and we're actually seeing a number of European governments turning to Cloudflare as part of project Fair Shot as they roll out the vaccine deployment and I think that is a good early indication of the trust that we've built in that market. Asia throughout 2020 has been definitely in the transition year for us, and we saw that its growth has not been as strong as we've seen in Europe. The reason for that we've talked about this on previous calls but the reason for that is that this is a complicated market in terms of how and in terms of the multitude of various bandwidth providers and you have a bit of a chicken and egg problem where in order to get enough bandwidth to get great pricing from providers you have to have a whole bunch of customers but in order to get a whole bunch of customers you have to have great pricing and so we made what I think was a very smart and rational decision earlier in Cloudflare's history to take on customers that we knew we would be unlikely to have with us over the long term, but that would give us that initial bandwidth usage in the region in order to get the interconnectivity, the performance and the pricing that we needed. And so I'm encouraged by one of the examples that we gave was the $8.5 million contract for a large Asian financial institution which adopts us. They are going to be a real lighthouse customer for us. I think they're going to up level with the response there. We've also brought in a new head of our Asian sales effort who came to us out of AWS and we're super excited for him to join and I think that Asia is really poised to be a to kind of go from a rebuilding year in 2020 to a real position of strength in 2021. \nJames Breen: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is open. \nGray Powell: Okay. Great. Thanks for working me in here. Congratulations on the good quarter. So maybe some other follow-up questions on Cloudflare access. In our field work we've heard that a lot of customers that rushed out in March of last year to increase their legacy VP capacity for work from home initiatives that they're now looking for more modern solutions and I think you kind of hit on that earlier but is that something you see today and do you see a potential for cloud for access adoption to accelerate over the next six months? \nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks Greg for the question. I think that the I think that this the story of 2020 was really everybody kind of holding on for dear life in the IT world and hoping that they could hold things together and that meant if you were relying on a bunch of legacy hardware VPN you put in a big order early in the year just to get whatever you could in the door to make sure that your team could continue to be productive. But what I'm hearing from the CTOs and CIOs and CSOS that I talk with is is one phrase over and over again which is never again. They having lived through this and seen the pain that it caused they never want to be in a position to have to manage something like that again. And I think also, large enterprise organizations are waking up to the fact that the sort of workplace in the future is going to be more flexible about where and when and how people work. And so we're definitely hearing from people who frankly for the last nine months were like I'm too busy to even take your phone call. They are now starting to put their heads up and say I don't want to keep investing in what I know is the solution of the past and so I think that that definitely for both our access and gateway products but really for the overall Cloudflare 1 solution is important. And so I don't think that are at the sort of tail end of that wave of of transformation. I think we're much earlier in that process and the story of 2020 was not CIOs sticking their heads up and saying gosh we got to go, sign up for Cloudflare. The story of 2020 was people were trying to figure out how to survive. I think the story of 2021 might be that there is a much broader move away from what had been a traditional castle and moat would have been a traditional hardware-based security approach to a much more modern zero trust approach and we're optimistic that Cloudflare can be one of the leaders as companies do make their way through that transition. \nGray Powell: Understood. That makes perfect sense. Thank you very much. \nJayson Noland: Operator, can we take one more question please?\nOperator: Sure. Your final question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: \u2026 sneaking in under the wire. Hey I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the domains of the main traffic protection market particularly as we see more and more adoption of Kubernetes than other modern micro service based applications and that in turn drives more domain and main application to application traffic. What are you seeing in terms of that contributing to your protection of data and flight and how do you think that evolves as we go forward? We have seen other companies trying to get into that space but it seems like a natural for you guys. \nMatthew Prince: Yes Alex I think it is I think a natural extension of both our access and our gateway products and one of the things that we see a lot is that customers that have complicated network architectures where they might be running some of their own applications on AWS or a Microsoft Azure they may be using some machine learning out of an IBM or Google. They may be using other SaaS vendors and really coordinating between that. What we're seeing is that we have really positioned ourselves I think well to be the network that connects those various pieces together. So one of the initiatives that we launched some time ago we called the bandwidth alliance and that is a way that if you're moving data between clouds or between SaaS applications that we can help you do so in both the most efficient way but also then save you money. We connect to all the major public cloud providers over a private network interface and we don't pay, send them bandwidth and they don't pay to send us bandwidth and so our argument to them was well why should we be charging customers for exchanging that bandwidth themselves and we we've had a lot of success in getting a number of the the large cloud providers to adopt this and that then means that not only can you get the real benefit of Cloudflare in terms of security, access, control, visibility but you can actually save money on your underlying cloud spend as well. And so I think that that's definitely an area that that us being that connective tissue between clouds and between applications is a very natural point for us and it's part of why at our core we think of Cloudflare as a network and we're a network that can help connect multiple applications even if they are across different providers together. \nAlex Henderson: I wanted to for a second question that go back to the staffing commentary. I think you said in the quarter you had a 41% increase in staff and I assume more of the disproportionate piece of that went into the sales and marketing piece particularly going after the large enterprise. As we look at FY 21, can you give us any metrics around your expectations for the sales capacity growth in that state it still up in the 50% plus range on a full year basis or any other metrics along those lines that would help us guage that capacity extension.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So I'll take a stab at the beginning of it and then Thomas can weigh in if he has anything to add. I think that 2020 was pretty remarkable for us. We had nearly 200,000 people apply to work at Cloudflare and we only accepted about half a percent total applicant. Of those 200,000 about half were for sales and marketing roles within the company. So we saw very-very-very strong raw numbers of applicants and we're seeing those applicants coming to us from really other enterprise sales organizations that we admire at every level both from early in their career to seasoned leaders that can lead that team. And so we've invested heavily in building out our sales capacity over the course of 2020 and we will continue to invest in that and we've got a great pipeline of candidates that are excited to join our team and I'm just really blown away by the caliber of the people who we're interviewing or are on boarding on a weekly basis. \nThomas Seifert: Then what I would add Alex is that we will continue to invest in our sales capacity but it's a more sophisticated approach than just hiring people. We have to balance more levers and we are getting better at it expanding DNR as one example a stronger focus on general partners and from an international go to market perspective will be part of that but overall sales capacity will continue to increase and we will invest heavily into it.\nAlex Henderson: Okay. Thanks. I guess that's a wrap. \nOperator: I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks. \nMatthew Prince: I appreciate first of all everyone at Cloudflare who worked incredibly hard this year to take what was a challenging year and be there for each other, for our customers and for the internet as a whole. I am proud of the role that Cloudflare played in making sure that the internet held together during what was a year that was really-really extraordinary. I'm looking forward to talking with many of you tomorrow on our investor day that kicks off right at 12 PM Pacific time. It's open to anyone. You just need to register to at our investor relations page which is at cloudflare.net and so until then I look forward to giving you more of an update and hope to see many of you tomorrow. Thank you. \nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you everybody for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you Matthew and thank you to everyone for joining us. Well, it has been a year of challenges I'm extremely proud of our team's performance and unrelenting execution in serving our customers in global communities with an outstanding fourth quarter where we again exceeded the high end of our guidance wrapping up an exceptional year across the board. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 50% year-over-year to $125.9 million. Total revenue for fiscal 2020 also increased 50% year-over-year to $431.1 million. Since 2016 we've grown at a compound annual growth rate of 50% demonstrating our continued growth at scale. From a geographic perspective we saw noteworthy strengths in the U.S. and EMEA. The U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 54% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 60% year-over-year. The Asia-Pacific represented 16% of revenue and increased 33% year-over-year. As you know [indiscernible] signed a three-year deal last year to build out 150 points of presence in China and we excited to say that the relationship is off to an excellent start. I do renew this contract in the fourth quarter for the next six months. We're in the process of transitioning from Baidu to JD is our primary partner in China. This transition might result in temporary short-term headwinds to growth in that region. Expanding internationally remains a priority. We open three new international offices in 2020. The first in Tokyo, followed by Paris and Toronto. With our inverted go to market strategy we invest behind the demand we are seeing and the success of the customers we acquire helping to remove risks as we continue to expand internationally. Turning to our customer metrics. We exited the quarter with more than $3.5 million total free and paying customers representing an increase of 38% year-over-year. In Q4 we had a record quarter of paying customer editions adding over 10,000 paying customers sequentially and over 27,000 paying customers year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 111,183 paying customers representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. The acceleration in paying customer growth was primarily driven by increased new product adoption from free to paying customers. We ended the quarter with 828 large customers which we defined as paying customers with greater than a $100,000 in annualized revenue representing an increase of 57% year-over-year. We added 92 large customers sequentially and over 300 in 2020. We saw significant expansion from our large enterprise customers which helped to drive a dollar based net retention rate of 119% representing a 3 point increase sequentially. Our enterprise total market efforts generated significant ROI which we look forward to providing additional insight on during our investor day tomorrow. Efficiency remains at the core of our business and is demonstrated in the consistently high gross margin we generate from growing revenue and in the low CapEx we need to deploy and build out the footprint and capacity of our network. Fourth quarter gross margin was 78.1% representing an increase of 80 bases points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 9% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 12% for the year in line with the guidance shared last quarter. We expect to see continued variability in how we deploy network traffic over the year but we expect that we'll continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue. Turning to the operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased 18% year-over-year to 82%. We had another strong hiring quarter with an increase of 41% year-over-year bringing our total number of employees to 1788 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $58.2 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 46% from 52% in the same quarter last year. We continue to invest in our go-to-market efforts to add sales capacity and expand our global footprint. Research and development expenses were $25.7 million in the quarter. R&D as the percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially and decreased to 20% from 26% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $19.9 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and decreased to 16% from 22% in the same quarter last year. Scaling our business efficiently remains a top priority and we continue to see strong operating leverage in the fourth quarter with operating margin improving 1750 basis points year-over-year. Operating loss was $5.5 million compared to $18.3 million in the same period last year. Net loss in the quarter was $7.4 million to a net loss per share of $0.02. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 28%. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $23.5 million or 19% of revenue compared to negative $23.5 million or 28% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was negative $8.8 million in the fourth quarter or 7% of revenue which decreased $10.8 million sequentially in a slight decrease of roughly $200,000 year-over-year. The Q4 decrease in operating cash flow was driven primarily by an increase in DSO due to seasonality. Collections, however, have come in strong in January. We expect to see some level of variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital, the growth in our large enterprise business and seasonal factors. Additionally, we expect to see cash flow impacts due to investments and leasehold improvements as we think towards the future of how we use our offices and reinvent our spaces to support a new hybrid work environment. Before moving to guidance for the first quarter and full year I would like to provide a brief update on COVID related impacts and associated provisions we shared last quarter. Throughout 2020 we've disclosed the percentage of revenue represented by customers in COVID macro-sensitive industries such as transportation, hospitality and retail. This cohort represented 8% of revenue in the first quarter, 7% in the second and third quarter and we are pleased to share that this percentage remain consistent at 7% in the fourth quarter. Customer concessions and bad debts also came in well below expectations again this quarter and have remained consistent with historical levels. In Q4 we saw another strong quarter of new ACV growth increasing average customer spend in high sales productivity. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO rpo remains strong in Q4 coming in at $384 million representing an increase of 12% sequentially and 75% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. Given the strong growth and momentum we are seeing we remain optimistic about the demand for our product and confident in the continued growth of our business. As such we are pleased to again raise our outlook for both the quarter and full year. For the first quarter we expect revenue in the range of $130 million to $131 million representing an increase of 42% to 44% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $9 million to $8 million and we expect net loss per share in the range of $0.03 to $0.02 assuming approximately 306 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of negative 20%. For the full year 2021 we expect revenue in the range of $589 million to $593 million representing an increase of 37% to 38% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $25 million to $21 million and we expect net loss per share over that period in the range of $0.09 to $0.08 assuming approximately 309 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2021 of negative 60%. In closing, it was another very strong quarter closing out an extraordinary year. I again want to thank our employees for delivering these great results and for their continued dedication. We hope to see many of you tomorrow as we'll be hosting our first Investor Day where we look forward to sharing a detail on our products and platform as well as providing an update on our financial progress and targets. And with that I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator please call for questions. What I would add is I mean there two really good examples that all come to my mind where you can see, how we can use margin as strategic weapon one more [indiscernible] for the very first time, you saw this last year when we gave our team's product await for free for pretty much most of the year and then we had other products when we supported the election platform so, we have done that in the past and this will be [indiscernible] stay with that strategy moving forward. [indiscernible] your second question [indiscernible] heavily insert last year in terms [indiscernible] reps but also leadership with higher great talent. I think the real positive over the last year was that we are able to keep our failed productivity extremely high both in terms of our on-board people and [indiscernible]. But also in terms of how much they retire once they ramped on. And we will continue to invest into capacity and moving into this year. I think we always said that our commitment to send salesman marketing both continuous longer returns though it's a period of [indiscernible] and really balanced successfully and [indiscernible] outstanding job and will continue to peruse this path for this year too. Well let me get started then Matthew joins in. We observed as well last year in times of uncertainty to be thoughtful and prudent about the guidance that we provided for the year and I think we applied the same approach. We lean in more this year if you compare the guidance we give at the beginning of this year and compared to last year but we also have to recognize the numbers become bigger. There is a lot of large numbers and there is still uncertainty out there that has not diminished making guidance an easier topic as last year. So I think it's a prudent and thoughtful approach thinking through the opportunities but also weighing the risks that undoubtedly are still out there. Then what I would add Alex is that we will continue to invest in our sales capacity but it's a more sophisticated approach than just hiring people. We have to balance more levers and we are getting better at it expanding DNR as one example a stronger focus on general partners and from an international go to market perspective will be part of that but overall sales capacity will continue to increase and we will invest heavily into it."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you Jason. We had an excellent quarter to top off a remarkable year. We achieved $125.9 million in revenue of 50% year-over-year. For the year our revenue was a bit over $430 million up 50% over 2019. I wanted to pause and thank all our team at Cloudflare for the hard work that resulted in another year of extraordinary growth. Beyond revenue are other business metrics in the quarter were very strong. Our paying customer account grew to over a 111,000 up 10% quarter-over-quarter and our strongest quarterly growth in several years. Large customers those that spend over a hundred thousand dollars per year with us continue to be our strongest growth area adding 92 new customers in Q4 and bringing our total large customer account to 828. Revenue from these large customers increased sequentially to 49% up from 47% in Q3 as our sales team continues to close larger and larger enterprise accounts. As you look across customer segments by side our large customer segment is growing the fastest. This is because of new logo wins and also because our land and expand motion is picking up steam. We saw initial evidence of this earlier in the year but are now seeing it reflected in lagging indicators like dollar-based net retention which increased 300 basis points sequentially to 119% in Q4. While there may be some volatility in that number going forward I'm encouraged that when you dig into what's behind that improvement it's being driven primarily by customer adoption of our expanding product portfolio. In particular we're seeing more of our existing customers adopt cloud corporate teams our zero trust network security solution as well as Magic Transit. Customers see that they can use the full range of Cloudflare's products to achieve the corporate network of the future. This is the vision we articulate with Cloudflare 1 and it's resonating with customers. In other words our sales team is more successful in part because our R&D teams keep delivering more products and features our customers need. Innovation is the energy the fuels Cloudflare. One thing that kept coming up over the course of the quarter was how our pace of innovation is cabinet for developers. This is something I plan to talk more about tomorrow at our Investor Day but to give you a preview from our earliest days developers were our core audience. We made it easy for them to sign up and get started using our services without having to go through a traditional sales process. If the feature didn't work exactly how they wanted we let them have full control through our workers development platform and while we augment our developer first sign-up process with a terrific sales team every product we launch is designed to be adopted by developers first. One way of measuring this is the rate at which developers are adopting our Cloudflare workers edge computing platform. In Q4 more than 50,000 new developers wrote and deployed their first Cloudflare worker. That rate of new developers building on workers for the first time in a quarter has more than doubled since we last reported it in Q2. But it's not just workers that brings developers to Cloudflare platforms. That's why one of my favorite stories from the quarter was not one of our biggest wins on a dollar basis but rather one that I think evidences how developers see the broader Cloudlflare platform.  The engineering team at one of the leading software companies themselves building tools for developers approached us about better securing their own development environment. This project wasn't imposed by the IT organization from the top down but instead led by developers of the company from the bottom up. They knew having seen increasing threats and attacks like the one that impacted solar wind they needed better access control. They led the process define the best solution and they chose CloudFlare access, part of our Cloudflare team suite in our conversations with them one seemed kept coming up. Cloudflare is the only company with a zero trust solution that really understands and is built for the needs of developers. It's a 70,000 annual deal to start and we expect we'll be able to grow with this customer but I think it's an indication of something more important. Developers are the future of IT and having won their trust we expect will help us win, retain and expand more and more customers over time. To that end here are some of our more traditional big wins for the quarter. A Fortune 500 oil and gas conglomerate signed a three-year $1 million deal to implement a portion of our Cloudflare 1 architecture including Magic Transit, DDOS mitigation, firewall and DNS, replace spend they had with legacy telecom providers. They had faced serious technical challenges trying to integrate the telecoms network services with third-party offerings. We also beat out a number of point cloud solutions. The customer appreciated our ease of use, technical innovation and the way multiple products fit together into a unified solution. A fortune 500 U.S. financial provider signed a three-year $1.6 million deal to replace legacy telecom spends and moved towards the Cloudflare 1 architecture. They were particularly impressed with our product roadmap and our pace of innovation. Sticking with financial services for a second a Fortune 500 Asian financial services company signed a four-year $8.5 million deal with us. They too are implementing our Cloudflare 1 architecture to modernize their corporate network. While we often win deals that are driven by developer team this is an example of a classic IT led RFP our sales team engaged with the customer, built the relationship and won the business. As part of the win our solutions engineering team was able to use our Cloudflare workers platform to seamlessly migrate the customer from their previous provider. A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company leaning into their Cloudflare implementation further adopting the Cloudflare 1 architecture. They signed a $450,000 per year deal to add our Magic Transit service. The company had received the threat from a hacker targeting their network. We received a call from the customer on a Friday and had them onboarded over the weekend. I think this speaks both to the nimbleness of our solution and also to the fact that when existing customers have security needs Cloudflare is increasingly their first call. A fortune 500 semiconductor provider signed a three-year $1.4 million deal to replace a legacy network provider. The buyer appreciated our technical innovation, the way our products seamlessly work together and our performance. They said their previous fender solution \u201cworks but it's clunky and slow with bolted on parts\u201d as for Cloudflare he described this as \u201cmuch more agile\u201d and \u201cthe company of the future\u201d that really made me smile. A fortune 1000 enterprise software provider signed a three-year $2.6 million deal to implement Cloudflare across their organization. They initially came to us in order to improve their performance in China something they struggled to be able to do with any other provider. They were also impressed with our workers edge computing platform. They are fast growing technically savvy organization and we look forward to growing with them on their path to joining our other Fortune 500 customers. Before I hand it over to Thomas I wanted to take a second to reflect back on 2020. It was a remarkable year for Cloudflare for the internet and well for all of humanity. We were proud to be there when the world needed the internet more than ever before. Helping our customers shift to remote work ensuring the network itself could scale to handle a massive increase in traffic providing the Athenian project and Cloudflare for campaigns to ensure cyber attacks didn't disrupt the 2020 election and most recently launching project Fair Shot to help governments municipalities, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies around the world more fairly distribute the COVID-19 vaccine. As one of the hundreds of organizations that has reached out to implement project Fair Shot said the other day \u201cCloudflare has literally helped save lives\u201d. It was incredible to watch our team rapidly build the technology behind project Fair Shot on our workers platform and deploy it at tremendous scale in a matter of weeks. We're incredibly proud of how our technology and expertise helped make a challenging year a little bit better. But it wasn't easy. We had to shift to working remotely while continuing to recruit, hire, innovate, deliver, scale and sell our services. While there were some tailwinds there were a lot of headwinds too. In April for instance traffic grew across our network more in two weeks than we had expected it to over two years. That put pressure on our business. Less than 5% of our revenue comes from usage-based products. So when traffic spikes our associated cost spikes but our revenue doesn't automatically follow. Now customers love the predictability of this. The last thing anyone wanted in 2020 was a surprise bill and our consistent pricing is one of the things that differentiates us but that means our team has to do the hard work; renegotiating bandwidth agreements, inventing new technologies and continuing to wring out every penny of efficiency. That's why I was particularly impressed that our gross margin was 78.1% in Q4 it's actually down 60 basis points year-over-year. I'm proud of the fact however that we could do all the things to keep the internet working the way it needed to in 2020 and it only cost us 60 basis points. We didn't raise prices on our customers when they needed us most. We didn't sacrifice the quality of our service. We did what we do, invented new technology and got more efficient and going in 2021 look out we're a lean, mean innovation machine and we have no intention of slowing down. With that I'll turn it over to Thomas. Yes. Phil thanks for the question. We were very excited to see that the paying customer count was up as strong as it was and that's our strongest quarter-over-quarter growth we've had in some time. I think there's not one specific thing that I would point to. I think that we've built what is a strong machine sort of a strong horse plowing through a snow field, a quiet field if you will but I think that we're always looking for ways that we can get either our existing customers that are on the free version of our service to pay us or to get more people to come into the funnel. And so I think there are three different areas that I would point out. The first is that our total customer account had really strong performance as we saw people just adopting Cloudflare as a whole a lot of those customers start out as free customers and migrate up but some percentage will start as paying customers from day one and so as the total customer account grows it was the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth we had in in all of 2020 last quarter as well and that total customer account. That feeds that. I think the second thing was we launched a new feature which we call Automatic Platform Optimization or APO that had real appeal for a lot of our existing free customers where they could with one click of a button and a payment to us get substantial improvement on especially Wordpress driven sites. And so I think that that drove some potential additional attention and additional usage and then we also saw some of the customers that were using the free versions of our teams product and if you remember at the beginning of the pandemic we made Cloudfare for teams a free product. A lot we had very good very strong conversion of that and that translated into paying customers some of which showed up in the quarter. So I think it was those three things plus us just continuing to execute and again really proud of our team. Yes, we had seen for quite some time that there is a lot of angst over that surprise bill that variable based billing leads to and I think that especially as you are trying to sell service like a security service if you get a cyber attack and all of a sudden you get a bigger bill from your provider than the provider not much different than the attacker themselves, both of them are costing you and so from the beginning we really believed that it was important to keep our port services on a fixed predictable basis and so team that we were hearing already in Q4 and coming through now into Q1 is that company after the craziness of 2020 are looking for a level of predictability and we definitely see our ability to use our strong gross margin performance to potentially display some of those providers that really surprise customers over the course of 2020. Yes. So I think that we have two different ways that we look at that. So there first of all there have been companies that started out on a small portion of their team using that team's product and so that the team's product grows naturally with the number of steeps that adopt it and so our team right now is focused on a lot of we had a lot of success which we talked about last quarter in converting those free customers to being paying customers and now I think what we're trying to do largely for those is take them from being small customers and grow them into larger and larger customers over time. And so that's one bit of focus. I think we have continued to try to be really empathetic to the customers that continue to be in either industries or segments that are tough and so we have continued to extend for those businesses that are still being hampered by the pandemic, their payment terms and continue to extend that free offer. We want to be focused on the long term and we think we're building a relationship with those customers, the feedback is that they're very positive and well that's a small percentage of that overall base that's something which we do think there's opportunity around but the bigger one is we think that once an organization starts using the team's product and we make that super easy for them to use for a small part of their organization that gives us an opportunity to really expand that product over time and that's really where our team is focused. Yes I think that it depends. I think that the usual motion to adopting the full Cloudflare 1 suite remains that a customer will come to us with a very specific need. They will need to put in new access controls around some of their applications or services. They will need to defend against a new vulnerability or cyber threat that they've become aware of but once we get into the selling motion what we see is that customers really care about the overall platform and how it fits together and that's what Cloudflare 1 represents and one of the things that Thomas will be talking about tomorrow during our investor day is how we have continued to see real strength in getting customers not just to adopt any one solution or any one product of ours but to adopt that overall solution and as we talked about in our IPO what we think about is that once a customer is using four or more of our products it's very-very difficult to compete with us because of the broad suite and so we are definitely working with customers to try to get them to that four more number and Thomas we'll talk about tomorrow a little bit more of the success we've had doing that. Yes. Thanks Brent. So I'll start and then and Thomas can add more color. So the first thing is and again not to have to keep plugging Thomas's segment tomorrow but I was just looking over the slide and we're going to provide a lot more color on exactly how the various customer segments are working and how the growth at the strongest then and the largest customers is the fastest growing portion of our business. I think that's driven by two different things. I think the half of that is coming from our increasing ability at landing big deals early and so we are seeing more and more that when there is a sort of traditional multi-million dollar RFI or RFP which is submitted that we have the team to be able to respond to that and win those deals and the product is in place and we're winning more of those deals at the very beginning and I think that's a really good sign. I think the other part is a really good sign is that our land and expand motion continues to pick up steam and we're seeing more customers grow into those larger categories and again tomorrow Thomas will provide more clarity on that but I think that what we see across our entire organization is that we're adding the support in order to really make sure that those customers have a terrific experience and that means bringing on great sales people. We're not one of the companies that believe that you can get away without having sales people. If you have customers who are spending $1 million to $10 million with you they want to have someone that they can really build a relationship with and so tomorrow we will outline a lot of some of those sales leaders who have joined our team and the really incredible kind of enterprise DNA that they're bringing with us and I think that's making us a better and better company. Yes, we've had some very strong number for quite some time. And I don't think that there is anything, there hasn't been anything that has changed that underlying gross retention number it's continued to trend at a very strong level and so most of the improvement in dollar based net retention is actually in our ability to better upsell to customers. Yes. Thanks Matt. I think it's early for us to be able to indicate clearly whether that had a significant impact yet. I think that the first thing that was the question that we got from our customers was were we impacted? And the answer was no, we weren't SolarWind customer. I think the more important thing and a story that I think that the market is waking up to is how a zero trust approach to security like the one that Cloudflare can help with really acts almost as almost bulk heads in a ship. There are going to be flaws in software overtime and SolarWind was impacted this time but the real challenge is that because an attacker was able get them through SolarWind, they were then able to once they were in move across the entire organization and that is a symptom of the previous sort of castle and mode approach. Once you find one more across one mode, you have access in higher capital. And that's talent whereas I think the real, the real brilliance of a zero cost approach is that it put those natural bulkheads in place, so that if there is some sort of breach in one part of an organization, then the attacker then can't move laterally across the rest of that. And so that's the main that we have implemented as our own security systems and it allowed us to very quickly not only verify that we weren't using SolarWinds anywhere at Cloudflare but then also they really do an assessment then, there was nothing else that they created an issue for it. And I think also when we sell our Cloudflare for teams our products to customers this idea they much more modern zero trust approach to security is reasonating. And so I think SolarWind is one instance where it's going to be a tailwind to sell more zero trust approaches and we think that our zero trust approach is not only the most developer friendly and the most effective that's out there and I think overtime that will lead to more and more customers for it. Yes. So one of the things I think is unique about Cloudflare is that we provide a truly global network that has extended extends around the entire world including into China. And so for our customers that care about performance in China this is a way for us to be able to give them a unified platform and that was a pretty, it was a pretty ambitious goal for us to set out on and we set out on a journey with Baidu in 2014 to build that one unified network and for them to be our partner in China. They have been a terrific partner to us over the course of the last six plus years and we appreciate everything that they have done in order to help us do that. We wanted to upgrade the network in China and really make it something that was going to be even more performant and dramatically increased the presence that we had and so we went out looking at see whether it was Baidu or JD or who would be our partner for what we hope will be another six plus year relationship. And the team at JD really impressed us both in terms of their technical acumen and their ability to help us really build out what is an extensive network across what is often a very complicated region for both technical and other regions. And so over the course of the next three years we're working with JD to build out over 150 points of presence in China alone. We'll be able to have our customers opt in to using that if they want and we can also generate revenue as JD sells the rest of our global network to customers elsewhere. As we transition off, there was a payment that was coming from Baidu in the past for us. That will diminish and where we have a payment that comes from JD that picks to pick some of that up but in the meantime that transition there may be some headwind. We don't think it's going to be material and it's all baked into our existing guide. Yes thanks for the question. And I think that our rate of innovation is something that Cloudflare was really designed for and it's something that I'm going to be talking a lot about at the investor day tomorrow about how we do that. We have no intention of slowing down our rate of innovation and so I think that you will see a series of product weeks that will be very similar to what you saw in 2020 with really great launches across that. That will include both taking products that we have announced and are currently in beta and moving them into GA and so we're excited about some of the extensions to our workers platform being generally available things like durable objects and making that something that people can sink their teeth into and really work on and the early feedback from the beta users has been terrific. But it also means us thinking about dreaming up new ways to take our network and deliver more value to that and so I think that 90% of our product and engineering organization is really focused on how do we take our existing products, take feedback from our users and continuously make those better like a traditional product organization. But we have this one team which we call ETI for Emerging Technology and Incubation which is about 10% of our R&D efforts who are really thinking about how do we dream up what is over the horizon and they they are not slowing down and I think that a lot of the things that plus over teams products and customer one for example are graduating out of ETI into our traditional product organization and that frees up some headroom for them to start thinking about what are the next products that are going to shake the industry 18 months from now. I would just echo what Tom has said. And I think that we have tried to be very thoughtful throughout this year. I remember when we were back in April after our early May and after our Q1 guidance I mean we didn't know what the world was in store and I think there's a lot of uncertainty still out in the world and while we've seen an enormous amount of success and we're excited we want to be extremely prudent about how we think about the future. Yes. Thanks Jonathan for the two questions. I can take a stab at both and then Thomas may have something to add. So I think that we've been very pleasantly surprised at the way that there is a cross-sell opportunity from different products. I think the two that seem to go together like like peanut butter jelly for us have been our access product which is all about how do we secure the access to applications which are exposed to internal users and our WAFF and DDOS products. I think other competitors in the market often think that sort of access and gateway fit naturally together and we see that as well but there's really an opportunity and what we're seeing is that as people are adopting a zero trust approach that means exposing more applications to the internet and while access controls are important to that and internet gateways are important to that when those things get exposed to the internet they have traditional web application firewall concerns and they especially have DDOS mitigation concerns. And so those different products end up fitting very nicely together and customers like that they can manage all of their security needs through one pane of glass and that's I think something that is very differentiated in our products versus other products that are in the marketplace or trying to cobble together a number of different solutions in order to get what Cloudflare offers out of the box. Your second question I think is, it really goes to what is the other side of the same advantage that we have, which is that early on in Cloudflare history we made the determination that every single server everywhere across our network would run every single bit of our software and so that means that we can deploy as we need more capacity for one product or another the the network automatically adjusts to that and allows us to be able to adapt. What that also means is that for products that are sort of as you put it forward versus reverse proxies which is just a direction that traffic is flowing it turns out you only pay, when you're paying for bandwidth you only pay for the larger of kind of inverses out and so it can often be at least on a bandwidth basis, it can often be that we can add new products to a customer's overall bill without it significantly changing what our underlying cost infrastructure is. And I think that's part of the secret cost of how Cloudflare works because our product team is always looking at what are the excess resources that we have on our network and how can we deploy products in order to take advantage of those excess resources. And so as we add if we have a customer that's using our DDOS and WAFF if we get them to adopt access and gateway it doesn't meaningfully change our cost basis and that also means that we can be very competitive and especially on an ROI basis versus competitors and we can bundle products together in a very effective way. Sure. I think that we had a very strong year in both the U.S. and Europe. Today the U.S. represents about 50% of our revenue and the rest of the world is the other 50% I think that Europe has had very strong growth and has really been a standout for some time. We had some, we were watching carefully especially as there were concerns around adoption of some U.S. technology companies and some of the privacy regulations but what I think you'd see in Q4 was we really leaned into the fact that Cloudflare is a privacy first organization and we saw that payoff in the results where more and more European customers are willing to adopt us and we're actually seeing a number of European governments turning to Cloudflare as part of project Fair Shot as they roll out the vaccine deployment and I think that is a good early indication of the trust that we've built in that market. Asia throughout 2020 has been definitely in the transition year for us, and we saw that its growth has not been as strong as we've seen in Europe. The reason for that we've talked about this on previous calls but the reason for that is that this is a complicated market in terms of how and in terms of the multitude of various bandwidth providers and you have a bit of a chicken and egg problem where in order to get enough bandwidth to get great pricing from providers you have to have a whole bunch of customers but in order to get a whole bunch of customers you have to have great pricing and so we made what I think was a very smart and rational decision earlier in Cloudflare's history to take on customers that we knew we would be unlikely to have with us over the long term, but that would give us that initial bandwidth usage in the region in order to get the interconnectivity, the performance and the pricing that we needed. And so I'm encouraged by one of the examples that we gave was the $8.5 million contract for a large Asian financial institution which adopts us. They are going to be a real lighthouse customer for us. I think they're going to up level with the response there. We've also brought in a new head of our Asian sales effort who came to us out of AWS and we're super excited for him to join and I think that Asia is really poised to be a to kind of go from a rebuilding year in 2020 to a real position of strength in 2021. Yes. Thanks Greg for the question. I think that the I think that this the story of 2020 was really everybody kind of holding on for dear life in the IT world and hoping that they could hold things together and that meant if you were relying on a bunch of legacy hardware VPN you put in a big order early in the year just to get whatever you could in the door to make sure that your team could continue to be productive. But what I'm hearing from the CTOs and CIOs and CSOS that I talk with is is one phrase over and over again which is never again. They having lived through this and seen the pain that it caused they never want to be in a position to have to manage something like that again. And I think also, large enterprise organizations are waking up to the fact that the sort of workplace in the future is going to be more flexible about where and when and how people work. And so we're definitely hearing from people who frankly for the last nine months were like I'm too busy to even take your phone call. They are now starting to put their heads up and say I don't want to keep investing in what I know is the solution of the past and so I think that that definitely for both our access and gateway products but really for the overall Cloudflare 1 solution is important. And so I don't think that are at the sort of tail end of that wave of of transformation. I think we're much earlier in that process and the story of 2020 was not CIOs sticking their heads up and saying gosh we got to go, sign up for Cloudflare. The story of 2020 was people were trying to figure out how to survive. I think the story of 2021 might be that there is a much broader move away from what had been a traditional castle and moat would have been a traditional hardware-based security approach to a much more modern zero trust approach and we're optimistic that Cloudflare can be one of the leaders as companies do make their way through that transition. Yes Alex I think it is I think a natural extension of both our access and our gateway products and one of the things that we see a lot is that customers that have complicated network architectures where they might be running some of their own applications on AWS or a Microsoft Azure they may be using some machine learning out of an IBM or Google. They may be using other SaaS vendors and really coordinating between that. What we're seeing is that we have really positioned ourselves I think well to be the network that connects those various pieces together. So one of the initiatives that we launched some time ago we called the bandwidth alliance and that is a way that if you're moving data between clouds or between SaaS applications that we can help you do so in both the most efficient way but also then save you money. We connect to all the major public cloud providers over a private network interface and we don't pay, send them bandwidth and they don't pay to send us bandwidth and so our argument to them was well why should we be charging customers for exchanging that bandwidth themselves and we we've had a lot of success in getting a number of the the large cloud providers to adopt this and that then means that not only can you get the real benefit of Cloudflare in terms of security, access, control, visibility but you can actually save money on your underlying cloud spend as well. And so I think that that's definitely an area that that us being that connective tissue between clouds and between applications is a very natural point for us and it's part of why at our core we think of Cloudflare as a network and we're a network that can help connect multiple applications even if they are across different providers together. Yes. So I'll take a stab at the beginning of it and then Thomas can weigh in if he has anything to add. I think that 2020 was pretty remarkable for us. We had nearly 200,000 people apply to work at Cloudflare and we only accepted about half a percent total applicant. Of those 200,000 about half were for sales and marketing roles within the company. So we saw very-very-very strong raw numbers of applicants and we're seeing those applicants coming to us from really other enterprise sales organizations that we admire at every level both from early in their career to seasoned leaders that can lead that team. And so we've invested heavily in building out our sales capacity over the course of 2020 and we will continue to invest in that and we've got a great pipeline of candidates that are excited to join our team and I'm just really blown away by the caliber of the people who we're interviewing or are on boarding on a weekly basis. I appreciate first of all everyone at Cloudflare who worked incredibly hard this year to take what was a challenging year and be there for each other, for our customers and for the internet as a whole. I am proud of the role that Cloudflare played in making sure that the internet held together during what was a year that was really-really extraordinary. I'm looking forward to talking with many of you tomorrow on our investor day that kicks off right at 12 PM Pacific time. It's open to anyone. You just need to register to at our investor relations page which is at cloudflare.net and so until then I look forward to giving you more of an update and hope to see many of you tomorrow. Thank you."

Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jason. We had an exceptional quarter. In Q3, we crossed a number of significant milestones. First, we blew through $100 million in quarterly revenue, achieving $114 million, up 54% year-over-year. We crossed 100,000 paying customers ending the quarter with just shy of 101,000. For large customers in the quarter, we added nearly 100, 99 precisely and now has 736 spending more than $100,000 per year with us. These large customers accounted for 47% of our total revenue in Q3, and we anticipate they will make up more than half of our revenue going forward. One goal we had at the beginning of 2020 was to win our first $10 million customer on an annual run-rate basis. We're proud that we achieved that this quarter. That customer a Fortune 500 software company started with us in 2016, because one of their engineering leaders had used the free version of our service on his personal site. He loved the experience and brought us to work, initially signing a $60,000 per year contract. It's grown quite a bit since then. Today, this customer has tightly integrated our network and customized our products deep into their staff. It's been a terrific partnership, and we expect we will continue to grow alongside them. We've had great success with our go-to-market efforts and especially stunning large enterprise customers. About half of our new revenue in the quarter came from new logos and about half from expanding relationships with our existing customers. Even as we continue to sign a record number of large enterprise customers, we remain very happy with the diversity of our customer mix. None of our customers account for more than 5% of revenue. And our top 20 customers remain well under 20% of total revenue. While we're incredibly proud of our financial results and the strength of our business, I wanted to talk about something else, we're also really proud of. Our team watched the United States election this week carefully, as I'm sure many of you did as well. Well, there's still some uncertainty around the ultimate outcome. And there have been and will be stories around who voted and how those votes were counted. One story we worried about a lot going into the election that didn't materialize was the impact of cyber-attacks. We played some role in that. In 2016 that wasn't the case. Four years ago at Cloudflare we watched with deep concern as attackers were able to use various techniques to subvert parts of the election infrastructure and undermine competence in its results. We decided shortly after it was our duty to provide our technology and expertise to ensure cyber-attacks don't disrupt fair election. We launched the Athenian project, which provides our enterprise class service for free to any state or local government elections officials. We also partnered with a nonpartisan civil society organization defending digital campaign, to work with the Federal Election Commission, so we can provide our services at no cost to national campaign without violating campaign contribution laws. This year, more than half of U.S. states participated in the Athenian project that includes so called Red, Blue and Purple states. More than half of the battleground states used Cloudflare in order to protect services like voter registration, poll location, precinct reporting, and official results. We worked both presidential campaigns and many of the Federal candidates for Congress. We were able to fend off cyber-attacks and saw no instances in which they impacted the ability of citizens to learn about candidates or to vote. That's a big step up from 2016. Well, democracy can be messy inherently depends on a process you can trust. We're proud of the small role we played in defending the democratic process. Switching to the other topic that continues to be top of mind for all of us, November will be the ninth month, most of the world has been impacted by COVID-19. While it's not in our nature to take victory laps, I wanted to pause to recognize our team and their ability to execute during these difficult times. Early in 2020, we began to see challenges sourcing equipment for our network, as the virus hit our Asia-based suppliers. Then, in late-March, traffic across our network spiked as the world shifted to working from home. In two weeks, we saw more than 50% growth in traffic, more than we had forecast for 12 months. At the same time, our team had to adjust to working remotely. Product managers and engineers had to figure out how to develop innovative new products without gathering around a physical whiteboard. Our go-to-market teams had to adjust to selling to customers without ever meeting them in-person. And we had to learn how to continue to hire and onboard great new members of our team without them ever stepping into an office. It would have been easy for them to step in any of these areas because our businesses stall, but our team has executed and our business has thrived. We've been able to continue to build out our network to meet the unprecedented demand for our services, while staying within our CapEx budget. Even though we charge almost exclusively on a fixed subscription basis, we were able to meet our gross margin target, hitting 77% Q3, without depriving our customers with burgeoning bills. And we'd exceeded our ambitious revenue goals actually accelerating growth, while continue to sign up larger and larger enterprise customers. We were prudent at the beginning of the pandemic, reserving for potential customer allowances and bad debt. And we've worked with a subset of our customers who have struggled during the pandemic, to ensure they always had a reliable network they can afford, knowing to being accommodating today with bias loyalty over the long-term. We've been fortunate that when our customers sort vendors, we've been sorted in the bucket of differentiated must have services. As a result, we've not seen pricing pressure and we've had fewer concessions and less bad debt than we forecast. We've also been able to hire great people. In Q2, we've received more than 40,000 applications and extended offers to a mere 0.6%. In Q3, we had over 60,000 and extended offers only 0.4%. An investor last quarter asked why that was an important statistic for us to mention? Companies are just collections of people, and we believe whatever company is able to attract and retain the best people will win. That we can organically attract so many great candidates, means we can save money by not having to hire third party recruiters. We can source candidates from less expensive geographies in order to achieve operational leverage, while still adding headcount to realize our ambitious plan, and we're more likely to have a diverse team with different outlooks, who will come up with solutions to problem that no one had dreamed up before. While COVID has created challenges for our team, it has also made our mission of helping build a better internet, resonate with team members and customers more than ever before. The world has never needed a better internet more than it has over the last nine months. And our team wakes up excited every day to deliver exactly that for our customers. In the last four months, we've been on a tear releasing a ton of incredible new products. We announced more than one product per day around Cloudflare workers, our serverless computing platform during the week of July 26. We celebrated our birthday during the week of September 27, with a series of products that are less about directly generating revenue, and more about doing the right thing for the internet. And more recently, we fleshed out our vision for Cloudflare teams with a new architecture called Cloudflare One over the week of October 11, which we dubbed the zero trust week. These weeks leverage one of our superpowers, engineering and marketing, and may result in significant spikes in organic inbound interest from potential customers. In fact, during zero trust week, organic inbound leads more than doubled of their already elevated level. Stay tuned, we have one more Cloudflare week before the end of the year focused on privacy and compliance. I wanted to drill into two products I know there's a lot of interest in, Cloudflare for teams and workers, first team. We launched by Cloudflare for teams in January and it happened to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time, as the world shifted to remote work and needed a scalable cloud based VPN and firewall replacement. Seeing how many businesses were struggling with the shift to remote work, we made the call to make teams free through September 1. We have thousands of companies ranging from small businesses to fortune 500 corporations take us up on our offer. Over the course of Q3, we began conversations with all of them to transition from the free offer to becoming paying customers. We are happy with how that went. 75% of customers transitioned from free to paid accounts that included some great new logos like JetBlue Travel Products, OneTrust and Delivery Hero. For some customers, who are still particularly hard to get by COVID, we allowed them to continue with the free offering until they can get their feet back under them. Teams is a very high margin product for us, so this doesn't cost us much. And as I said before, we've always found that doing the right thing by our customers paid back in spades over the long-term. Because the converted accounts transition came late in the quarter, and because teams seat based pricing tends to be even more land small and then expand in some of our other products, these new converted customers did not result in material additional revenue in Q3. However, the other benefits of running this program is how much it accelerated our learning curve. We had positioned teams as nearly all our competitors have with an asset management product we call Cloudflare access, and internet gateway products we call software gateway. What we learned since March is that customers wanted a more holistic solution. If you adopted zero trust networking model, you need an access and gateway component, but you inherently then are exposing more of your infrastructure to the internet, so you also need products like our web application firewall and DDoS mitigation. We also learned that by leveraging products like Argo Smart Routing and Magic Transit, we can provide a much higher quality of service unmatched by traditional zero trust vendors and delivering on the real promise of SD-WAN. These conversations with customers over the last nine months helped us realize there's an opportunity to package our services, with the addition of intrusion detection, next generation firewall and data loss protection, which we announced during zero trust week into a comprehensive solution that we believe can help define the future of the corporate network. We've dubbed this Cloudflare one, and we believe it's the sweet that is unmatched in the market. Turning to Cloudflare workers, it's incredibly exciting to see to have the platform is taking off. In Q3, more than 27,000 developers wrote and deployed their first Cloudflare worker, that's up from 15,000 a year ago. History proves with new computing platforms the more developers they have, the more quickly they improve and the more likely they are to win. Looking at GitHub and other sources of data on developer engagement, we believe more developers write and deploy real applications and code on Cloudflare workers every month, than every other edge computing platform combined. So, what are they building? One of the most viewed publications during the 2020 elections use Cloudflare workers to power their elections news platform, and ensure its scale during the unprecedented spike in traffic last Tuesday, as well as Wednesday and today. A popular health food company uses workers to power their online ordering system. An online marketing firm working with major brands uses workers to customize content on a per visitor basis. A publicly traded electronics testing firm uses workers to break their on-premise and cloud based infrastructure. An innovative start-up is using workers to power an online crypto scavenger hunt. And one of the largest online learning platforms uses workers to deliver their customized content during this time of skyrocketing demand. It's great to see more used cases every quarter, I think we're just scratching the surface. Most used cases today have focused on performance. Over time, I expect those use cases will pale in comparison to what is a much bigger opportunity, helping customers manage the challenges of compliance. As governments around the world increasingly insist on data localization and data residency, sending all your users data back to AWS feeds for processing will become unacceptable. What our largest, most sophisticated, most compliant sensitive customers are looking to workers for, is as a way to manage this increasingly complex regulatory environment. That's why during Cloudflare's birthday week, our announcement of durable objects may have been one of the most important edge computing developments you may have met. Durable object allows developers to define a data structure and store it faithfully on our network, close to users that need to access it in order to ensure performance and consistency. It also allows developers to define where that data can move across our network, and where it cannot, such as this users data may never leave the EU or this user\u2019s data may Brazil. Given Cloudflare\u2019s network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries worldwide, durable objects provides fine grained control over where data is stored and processed. That functionality is critical for the increasingly complex compliance challenges that face every global company today. In other words, the future of edge computing will be defined as much by intelligent edge storage as it is by computing. And while others are still working to launch their edge computing platforms, we have products like durable objects in market that are defining that future today. Before I hand it off to Thomas, I wanted to close by talking about three more fortune 500 large enterprise customers, whose business we won in Q3. A fortune 500 industrial manufacturing company came to us to consolidate multiple vendors and products into a single unified platform. They replaced discrete network optimization, load balancing and bot management vendors with Cloudflare, in order to in a [indiscernible] have a single pane of glass to understand and control what's happening on their network. They signed a $1.4 million annual contract in Q3. A Fortune 500 food and beverage company came to us following a security audit, they replaced their legacy network optimization service with Cloudflare. They use most of Cloudflare\u2019s core services including workers. They were looking to save money over their previous vendor and were able to cut their spend in half, while still being a very attractive customer for us. They signed a half a million dollar annual contract with us in Q3. Finally, a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company adopted the Cloudflare One architecture to protect their employees and global network. They were able to onboard 47,000 employees and contractors and more than 130 applications on the Cloudflare One. They were particularly impressed with the comprehensive solution as well as ease of use. They called out how much our solution reduced their internal IT support ticket load. They signed a $1.5 million annual contract in Q3. Sometimes you hit on all cylinders. We had one of those quarters. I wanted to take a second to thank the whole Cloudflare team, who are working hard to make Thomas and my job easy. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thanks again to everyone for joining us. As Matthew mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter where we exceeded the high end of our guidance, and with that topline beat carrying through to our strong operating margin and another quarter of positive operating cash flow generation. Total revenue for the third quarter were 54% year-over-year to $114.2 million. The growth in revenue was driven by new logo acquisition as well as expansion within our existing customer base. Included in our Q3 revenue is a one-time catch up of $1.9 million related to a customer renewal. Excluding this, non-recurring revenue our year-over-year revenue growth would have been 52%. From a geographic perspective, we saw strong performance domestically and internationally, with particular strengths in the U.S. and EMEA both increasing 58% year-over-year. The U.S. represented 52% of revenue, while our international business represented 48% of revenue, and increased 31% year-over-year. Turning to our customer metrics, we exited the quarter with more than 3.2 million total free and paying customers, representing an increase of 40% year-over-year. In Q3, we achieved an exciting milestone of over 100,000 paying customers adding roughly 4800 sequentially. We also had another record quarter of large customer additions, which we define as paying customers with greater than $100,000 in annualized revenue, adding roughly 100 large customers sequentially and 285 large customers year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 736 large customers representing an increase of 63% year-over-year, with particular strengths in North America. We've shown 60% plus year-over-year large customer growth every quarter since the first quarter of 2018, with large customers now approaching almost half of our total revenue. Similar to our disclosure last quarter, roughly half of the 736 large customers have been on the platform for less than one year and the other half for more than one year. Our third quarter dollar base metric tension was 116%, which increased 100 basis points sequentially and decreased 500 basis points year-over-year. We saw acceleration in topline revenue growth this quarter, driven by both existing customers as well as new customers who have been on the platform for less than a year. Overall expansion from large enterprise customers was again strong this quarter, with six of our top 10 deals in terms of new ACBs coming from existing accounts. We expect D&R to trend flat to up going forward with teams as a potential tailwind for expansion opportunities. Third quarter gross margin was 77.3%, representing an increase of 50 basis points sequentially, and the decrease of 160 basis points year-over-year, which is in line with the expectations we shared last quarter in our long-term target of 75% to 77%. Turning to operating expenses, we remain focused on building a long-term business with a sustainable growth while improving the operating leverage in our business. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 5% sequentially, and 22% year-over-year to 81%. We had another strong hiring quarter, increasing our headcount by 42% year-over-year, and bringing our total number of employees to 1,697 in the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $51.2 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 8% sequentially, and 26% year-over-year. Sales and marketing as the percentage of revenue decreased to 45% from 48% last quarter, and 55% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $23.5 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 11% sequentially, and 17% year-over-year. R&D as a percentage of revenue remain flat sequentially, and decreased 21% from 27% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 3% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. G&A as a percentage of revenue was 16%, representing a decrease of 2% sequentially, and 6% year-over-year. Scaling our business efficiently remains a top priority and we continue to see acceleration in operating leverage in the third quarter. The operating margins improving over 2,000 basis points year-over-year, and 550 basis points sequentially. Operating loss was $4.5 million, compared to $18.1 million in the same period last year. We've been hiring aggressively and expect to continue to invest behind the success we see in topline revenue. Net loss in the quarter was $5.7 million, or net loss per share of $0.02. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was negative 22%. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $17.9 million, or 16% of revenue, compared to negative $33.6 million or 45% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was positive $2 million in the third quarter or 1.7% of revenue, which decreased $2 million sequentially and increased $19.8 million year-over-year. Q3 operating cash flow was held by an increase in cash profitability, while offset by our annual D&O insurance payment, as well as changes in working capital. Our DSOs trended down slightly quarter-over-quarter and remains well within the historical range. Q3 network CapEx was 11% of revenue, and we expect it to trend down as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter. Before moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year, I would like to provide another update on the COVID-related impacts and the associated provisions we shared last quarter. You may recall, in our first quarter earnings call we disclosed the customers highly affected by COVID-related challenges, particularly those the macro sensitive industries such as transportation, hospitality and retail represented 8% of our business. In Q2 and Q3, this cohort was 7% of total revenue. We are pleased to see these customers facing COVID-related challenges turn to us as Cloudflare plays a critical role for them, as they accelerate their digital transformation plans. We also disclosed last quarter that we saw customer concessions come in well below the $2 million headwind we anticipated, trending down during the quarter to historical levels. This trend remained consistent in the third quarter with both concessions and bad debt coming in below expectations. We repeat to observe another strong quarter of new ACV growth, increasing average customer spend, and high sales productivity. In Q3, we observed an acceleration in remaining performance obligations RPO, which was $342 million, representing an increase of 25% sequentially, and 81% year-over-year. A multiyear partnership agreement of $50 million contributed to the growth in RPO this quarter. So, it's not expected to materially contribute to revenue until 2021. Excluding this large partnership agreement, we saw 73% year-over-year RPO growth. Again, we had a great quarter. Our results demonstrate the resiliency and differentiation of our business model, which emphasizes customer diversity with no customer representing more than 5% of revenue, strong visibility and predictability with a vast majority of our revenue build upfront on a subscription basis, and multiple vectors of growth fueled by the massive scale and efficiency of our global cloud network. Given the momentum we are seeing, the ability of our model and our differentiation from competitors, we remain confident in the continued growth of our business, and as such, are pleased to raise guidance for both the quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $117.5 million to $118.5 million, representing an increase of 40% to 41% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $10 million to $9 million. And we expect net loss per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.03, assuming approximately 304 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of negative 13%. For the full year 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $422.5 million to $423.5 million, representing an increase of 47% to 48% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $38 million to $37 million. We expect net loss per share over the period in the range of $0.13 to $0.12, assuming approximately $300 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2020 of negative 12.4%. We'd also like to inform you that we will be hosting a Virtual Investor Day on February 12, 2021, where we look forward to providing a deep dive into our products and our platform. In addition, we'll also be providing an update on our financial progress and targets for fiscal 2021. In closing, I again want to thank our employees for delivering these great results and for the continued dedication to our customers and global community. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for question.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nPhil Winslow: Hey, thanks guys for taking my question, and congratulations on really just a great quarter. And thank you for all the work that you do in securing our elections. Now a lot of numbers are really impressive this quarter, but large deals and really their contribution to revenue jumped out to us. Now in the past your team has talked about how four products was really often the tipping point customers to lead to higher net expansion rates and lower churn. Can you give us some more color in terms of the drivers of existing, but even newer customers that you mentioned consolidating more functions on a Cloudflare, driving these larger deals? And then just have one follow-up to that.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Phil, thanks for the question. I think that our traditional products that are kind of the tip of the spear continue to be case. So we saw a large number of companies that were coming under cyber-attack in Q3, that would turn to us. Originally, there's been our DDoS mitigation products. Increasingly, we're putting entire networks behind us using our Magic Transit product. And that has been extremely well received. I think the new addition to that which is really driving more and more initial interest to people coming to us for what we call our Cloudflare Teams product. So that's our access and gateway product. Pardon the pun but that has turned into a gateway for us to get more large customers onboard. And I think the thing that has surprised us over the course of the last nine months, as we really have been talking with those initial customers, and getting feedback is how much club those products that existed before the teams products, really actually dovetail nicely with the rest of the teams products. And so we're seeing a lot of times where someone will come to us for say, Cloudflare access and gateway, but then realize that they need a web application firewall, DDoS mitigation, and that's really been a differentiator for us versus a lot of the other zero trust vendors that are in the market.\nPhil Winslow: Great. It actually leads me to my follow-up, because in terms of just more services being available, as you mentioned, Cloudflare launch Cloudflare One, in October, it's really a culmination of a couple years or the individual component releases. Can you touch on just the early feedback you're getting from customers and projects? And how in particular you're positioning Cloudflare one versus competitors in the secure access service edge market that maybe have four proxies, but not reverse proxies or might have security abilities for networking and so on?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that we've always seen the vision for Cloudflare as building the future of the enterprise network. It's why when we take our symbol we didn't pick Cloudflare, we picked NET, because we think that we are the future of the network. And the individual products are really coming together. And we allow companies to adopt just the portions that makes sense for them. But what we realized is that the kaleidoscope of all of our different products, and the picture that they form together really is a compelling value proposition. And I think what differentiates us then is, first of all, the ease of use across all of those different products. Secondly, the unified control plane where you're not having to go to a number of different vendors. And finally that it can be significantly cost effective. And that last piece has been a big driver as CIOs and CTOs are looking to consolidate vendors, looking to simplify their deployment and looking to solve some of the budgeting problems they have. And we were there to help them with those issues.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks, guys and congrats again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Matthew, I guess, I would just focus over to workers and ask whether you've seen any change in terms of the percentage of new customers coming in that are taking workers? And what kind of penetration into the existing base you are starting to see with the platform?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. We're tracking very carefully that developer engagement of workers as a whole. And the fact that we hit 27,000 developers, that's not people who've created accounts, but that's actually written code and deployed it across our network. So they really have some skin in the game. And that's been a real involvement. Across our customers as we sign the percentage that adopt workers are holding pretty steady, around 20% of new customers coming onboard on a contracted basis are adopting the workers platform. As we've talked about before, we think that there is really kind of a short, medium and long-term opportunity for workers. The short-term opportunity that makes all of our existing products, the most programmable and configurable version in the market. So the most programmable firewall, the most programmable zero trust solution, the most programmable load balancer, that's what workers really delivers. And that's where the bulk of the sort of new customers are coming from. The medium-term solution is that it is a platform that allows our own team to innovate as quickly as we have. So all Cloudflare for teams was built using the workers platform. And we really think that the best development platform, the first best customer of those platforms is the company that builds them themselves. And that's the role that we're following. And the long-term opportunity, which, frankly, as I see that more and more sophisticated applications are being written and we gave a number of examples on the call. But what I'm really excited about is how the sort of large financial institution, healthcare organization, consumer applications that are existing on a global basis. Those companies with really sophisticated compute needs aren't cheap, increasingly seeing workers as a platform that they can do something with that they really can't do on any other platform. So we've been really happy with it. Again, I think it's going to be sort of a short, medium and long-term opportunity, but the long-term keeps getting closer-and-closer every day.\nSterling Auty: That makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Matthew on the $10 million transaction, I'm curious if you could just provide a little more high level color on what's happening there? How much opportunities left? And anything else you can give to fill in a great transaction for you guys. And then for Thomas, just a couple of questions on the guide. Good acceleration this quarter, but you're obviously guiding to a decel in Q4, I realized you have a tougher comp in Q4 from last year. But anything to keep in mind, given the deceleration Q3 to Q4 in terms of the year-over-year perspective just to put in perspective. Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: I'm glad you asked me the easy question and Thomas the hard question. So thank you for that. So the $10 million customers Brent, as I mentioned a customer with us since 2016. I think the thing that we see over and over again, is that not only organizations but individuals that fall in love with us for our pay as you go and even our free products often will then bring us to work. And that has allowed us to very quickly build a very loyal fan base in almost every IT organization in the world. And it really differentiates us. That customer is using us for a number of our web performance as well as our security products. They tend to be our older products, the products around DDoS mitigation WAF, and others. They're increasingly looking at adopting other products across their platform, including bot management and maybe even our Cloudflare for teams products. So, I think that we have been able to grow with them. We have become a key part of their network. We are able to continue, there are a number of different ways we can continue to expand their relationship with that customer. And I think that while this is the first of our $10 million customers, they're, we think that with anyone who's a Fortune 500 company, there's an opportunity for us to have a similar level of penetration.\nThomas Seifert: Coming back for guidance, I think a couple of points to make. First of all, we are pleased to be able to raise our guidance, again, both for the quarter as well as for the year. A couple of things are coming together, the keen [ph] growth rate for the third quarter was 52%. And we look at Q4 with a really difficult compare, growing 51% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of last year. And we are still in the middle of the COVID crisis with maybe a second wave hitting, so there is also uncertainty in the market on how this is going to affect macro factors. So, I think what you see is prudent guidance that shows confidence in the business model, keeps the tough compare in mind, and let's not forget this gets us to a growth rate for the year of 47% to 48%.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. Great quarter. One question we're getting is, as you guys look to move hot market and really get into some of these like Fortune 500 customers, how do you guys feel about the need for additional sales capacity and more direct reps that we traditionally know Cloudflare for being able to just go direct via the website, for example? Or what kind of a low touch model. So, I guess, how do you feel about your sales capacity and need for additional support?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, I appreciate the questions. So, I think that we have a very diversified go-to-market strategy. We are able to sign people up on a come in put in your credit card. But as we said in previous calls and it's continue to be the case, on this. In Q3, that is a smaller and smaller percentage of our revenue. And today it is well under 20% of revenue. And I think it has as we've written about in our founders letter and the F1 and the updated founders letter that we wrote before, being able to serve everyone and being able to build relationships with those individuals and those developers that can sign-up for their own account, even though it doesn't account for a substantial portion of our revenue, it has driven a lot of marketing benefits and it gives us a really strong relationship and a really developer love, which helps us when we're trying to win those large customers. In terms of sales capacity, we continue to move up market. We support customers. We don't believe that you can do what we do without having a sales team. And so we started with an inside sales team, early on in Cloudflare\u2019s history. We now increasingly have a direct sales team with experienced sales leaders that have come from other enterprise companies that have really been able to thrive over time. And I think one of the people who's been very helpful in this is Mark Anderson on our Board, who obviously came from a number of great enterprise sales organization. That's what has allowed us to continue to scale. So, we have great sales capacity. We've been hiring. One of the things has been amazing is that during this time, when a lot of people have pulled back hiring, we've actually stepped on the gas, and the caliber of the team as a whole and in particular, the caliber of the team that we're being able to attract in our field sales organization, really, I think is you're going to look back and say, wow, there was an incredible opportunity that they had during this particular time, and they took advantage of it.\nJames Fish: Got it. That's helpful. And then Matthew, a lot of product announcements over the last few months with things like browser isolation, and we go down the list. But, what's next? I mean, where do you see the Cloudflare platform as next app for [ph] handling? Could we see something on identity, for example?\nMatthew Prince: I think that our thought on identity has been that we really think partnering is the right place. Companies have largely made their best on what their identity management. Companies are going to be and so we're working with great companies like Okta, PingIdentity, Microsoft, in order to integrate their existing identity solutions. One of the things though, that we think its powerful and that we're hearing from customers, is that they often tend not to have one identity provider, they might have their contractors using one provider and their internal employees using another. And that could either be just because the complexity of running a business, it could be because of M&A activity. But what's powerful about the Cloudflare for teams product, and especially our access and gateway product, is that they can really rationalize the complexity of those various identity providers and say, you can mix and match of the plus Microsoft Active Directory, plus what might be a more consumer facing identity provider for contractors like a LinkedIn or a GitHub, and use one control plane provided by Cloudflare in order to deliver that. So I think that's an area, I think it's unlikely that we will go into directly. I think it's an area we're much more likely to partner in, but I think it is a way that we can help simplify the complex setup that a number of people have.\nJames Fish: Got it. Congrats again.\nMatthew Prince: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC capital markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I'll offer my congrats as well. I wanted to ask about Cloudflare One again. It certainly strikes us as a good opportunity, not only in your enterprise, but also sort of the midsize opportunity of the market. But I guess in particular, the enterprise is what really interests me, and it was great to hear you call it the pharmaceutical company. When you think about this platform, I was wondering, if you can give us more color on how it's priced, be it bundle all at cart? And what sort of ROI does a customer like that pharmaceutical company see when they standardize on One?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So, Matt, I appreciate it. We're really excited about Cloudflare One, and I think it is an emerging area for us. So when we published a few weeks ago, what was effectively the schematic for what we think of as the enterprise's the future. It really resonated with the market and a number of people, reached out to it. But it was conversations with customers that got us there. And we had traditionally thought of kind of Cloudflare for teams, and a lot of our other infrastructure products as being separate. But in retrospect it's kind of one of those forehead slapping moments where you realize that, these things go together like [Indiscernible] and HERSHEY'S Chocolate and the Marshmallow together creates this incredible thing which is better than the sum of its parts, it's more. And that gives us incredible opportunity for us to build something which really resonates with customers. Right now, we priced the various components of Cloudflare One individually, but one of the things that we think we're investigating is whether we can take what is effectively an architecture and turn it into a skew. And in that case, what we're investigating is there a way that we can bundle together a number of Cloudflare products, and sell them on just a per seat basis. And we think that that's really attractive on both ends of the market on one end and the low end of the market that allows us to get more of our features into start-ups, early stage companies, and really have them have the best possible architecture from early in their history. For larger companies, what we're seeing is that there's an opportunity for us both to help them rationalize a number of different vendors, and then hopefully, also allow us to grow with them. And so I think it's, it's a space to continue to watch, I don't think we know exactly how that's going to come together. But we do think that it is a real opportunity to both simplify the deployment of our customers, and help them have a very significant ROI with their deployment.\nMatt Hedberg: That's great. Makes a lot of sense. And then sort of the other big product, and it's been asked a couple times. But when we think about workers, how do you think about the size of that market? I know, it's a tough question. But when we think about alternatives there, when it comes to the speed of the Cloudflare network, it is quite unique. How do you think about just -- ultimately, I know, it's small today. But what is the monetization? What is the TAM opportunity there longer-term?\nMatthew Prince: We've really resisted, when we put together any TAM forecasts or anything else we've resisted. We've resisted kind of calling out what that is, because I think it's tough to say. Maybe this is a little bit heretical. But, I actually think that if the only advantage of workers is it's a little bit faster that the TAM is not that big. And while, I understand that there's a lot of excitement around edge computing, and Gartner will throw out a really large number. If you actually talk to developers, their priorities making something a little bit faster is sort of the last in their sort of hierarchy of needs. Whereas they have other things around ease of use, more affordability and reliability. The opportunity that I think is the biggest one, which I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is really around, how can we help companies with what is an increasingly regulatory compliance situation. So, if you imagine in the future, that what the folks at TikTok are living through what Facebook is increasingly facing in Europe, that comes to every business that is operating on a global basis, where the data for their customers is required to be kept in market and process in market, then there really isn't another platform on the market that can provide that solution without cobbling together a bunch of things. And if in the future, you've got 100 different laws in 100 different countries, then you need a network that spans 100 different countries. And I think that that's the real opportunity for workers. It's early there. But when we look at our largest, most sophisticated customers, that's where they're saying, this is a real opportunity. This is where we want you to invest. And that's why our team is investing in that area.\nMatt Hedberg: Super exciting. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And really nice quarter, you guys really blew it out the water in this quarter. I kind of want to ask about that, you talked about really good conversion on the free Teams customers. But that didn't add a lot to revenues, because they converted pretty late in the quarter. So, two questions on that. If it wasn't the like the Teams conversion driving all the upside, can you help us with what it was it like anything you could point to? And what drove that upside? And then part two, what are those Teams contracts look like when you are converting, 75% a huge conversion rate? And are these guys signing on for a longer-term contract? Or is it just a small part of their business today and expected to grow over time?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Keith, so let me take those in order. So, from the upside perspective, I think because of the nature of our business, where we're a subscription business, the seeds that a lot of this got planted early in the quarter and late in last quarter. And we just had a very, very strong growth across all of our various components of our business. I will say that as we tried to emphasize in the prepared remarks, the large customer segment, those customers that are over $100,000 and also those customers that are over $1 million, we're seeing more adoption from those customers. We're also seeing that we're getting more expansion from those large customers. And sometimes that expansion is actually coming so fast that it's happening within the year. And so it isn't yet reflected in our dollar base net retention numbers. So I think that, as I said, we hit on all cylinders here. And I'm really proud of the team, I think they did an incredible job delivering the quarter that we had, and it really was a team effort. And I don't think it was any one thing, but it was a combination of many different factors working out very well. On the teams side, I think those are typically annual contracts. We are in some cases signing longer-term contracts, but they are typically annual contracts. And we think that this is a newer product of having a little bit of flexibility to revisit pricing is makes sense, and it gives customers flexibility as well. And then it depends on various organizations. So some organizations are having very broad adoption across their entire team, someone like a Delivery Hero. That was a substantial adoption across their entire platform. Others are small businesses where they might adopt across the entire platform, but there aren't all that many seats. But because we've made the product so easy to use, we can service that into the market, we really don't have any competition at that part of the market. And then we sometimes see individual team, but what we've learned is that oftentimes when somebody adopts teams within an individual team, that that then spreads in an organization very well. And so we think it's actually the teams product is a real tailwind for our dollar based net retention. And it gives a very natural expansion motion over time for us, which is we think is really exciting.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. That's super helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Breen with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJames Breen: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just with respect to the new sales and some of the new customers, any particular products and you seem to be leading the pack in terms of the initial sale. And then of the customers, how broad is their take rate in terms of the products you offer? And I guess just geographically, any real focus U.S. international et cetera? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Sure, so I can start with those and then Thomas can add a little bit more color. So, I think our goal is to continuously be releasing new products so that the take rate on any given customer, even if they had adopted everything that we had yesterday, is we'll have new stuff for them tomorrow. And I think if you're not following our blog already, just the rate of innovation, the rate of the team has been able to continue to adapt and deliver products is really outstanding. And we're seeing that that is one of the many components that is driving our continued ability to grow and scale. It's really different on different customers in terms of what the take rate for the products are. But we do naturally see products that fit together fairly well. So the teams products fit very well with our DDoS and our web application firewall product. We're seeing a lot of interest over the last two quarters in our Magic Transit product, that tends to be a great again, tip of the spear product for us to come in with. But once somebody's entire network is behind us, that then allows us to approach them and talk about teams and some of the other products as well. So the journey into Cloudflare can come in many different directions. But we're really happy with again our ability to continue to innovate, continue to add to the platform and see the adoption of these new products by our existing customers.\nThomas Seifert: From a from a new ACV perspective, particularly strong quarter in North America. From a revenue production perspective, strong in both North America and Europe up to 58% year-over-year. Strong across all verticals, no vertical really that stood out very even performance across industrial, healthcare and other verticals.\nJames Breen: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gray Powell with BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Okay, great. Thank you very much for working me in and congratulations on the quarter. So I know you guys had a few questions on teams and access, and maybe I'll just throw in one more. How should we think about the typical uplift to an enterprise customers ARR when they go all in on Cloudflare access?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So, access is priced on a per seat basis and there are various tiers of that pricing. And so, the dimensions will be how many employees do they have on their organization and then what tier of that cloud service are they adopting. And so that could be, as low as a few dollars per seat, it could be as high as tens of dollars per seat. And it depends on exactly what their deployment is. But we are now seeing six plus figure deals that are just for Cloudflare teams. And again, we think it has a natural expansion on two direction, both when customers grow and then also, when we convinced those customers to adopt a higher per seat tier.\nGray Powell: Got it. Okay. And then I know you disclosed some numbers earlier this year. But did you have any updated stats on the total number of customers that had a free version of teams before Q3? And then I know you said 75% converted into quarters, so I'm just trying to figure out the raw number of customers that actually converted? And then can you give us any sense as to like, how big those customers are? They skew more small, mid or large enterprise?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, it was a couple thousand customers took us up on the free teams offer. Just to be 100% clear, we have also extended a free offer for small organizations and small team, which we which we plan to continue indefinitely. And we think that that's a really great gateway to get startups and smaller organizations onto the platform. So I think you were asking about the free offer that we made back in March, but there is this other free offer that will continue to expand over the long-term. In terms of the people that took us up on the free offer, it really was across the board. We mentioned a handful of what a relatively large organization that are part of this. There were much larger organizations as well, that came in through that funnel. I would say the majority would reflect what is sort of a typical distribution of sizes of companies. So we would have a lot of small businesses that are in that mix. But then a handful of Fortune 500 and very large customers as well.\nGray Powell: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you very much.\nJayson Noland: Mariana, can we take questions from one last analyst, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. I'm glad I was able to squeeze in. I guess two for me. First one, I know we've talked about Cloudflare One a fair amount, but I was wondering if you could perhaps address, the topic on two fronts. One, the traction you see, is it SKUs more enterprise or SMB? And do they both like it for the same reason or different reasons? And then secondly in the instances where you're winning, where you're getting deployed, what exactly are you replacing? Or what other entity that you're replacing in the infrastructure there?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So I think that actually somewhat opposite how we went to market with a lot of Cloudflare's other products. We're actually seeing for Cloudflare One and the products that make up Cloudflare One more interest in the larger enterprise segment first, and then we're trying to pull that down to small businesses. We don't see really any competition in the self service, pay as you go segment. And so we think that that's an area that we can really, help define what the standard is, and that that will be a fertile ground. But if we look at the people the organizations that are adopting Cloudflare One, if you look at the leads that were generated from that interest in it, it really has been the much larger end of the of the customer set, both in terms of new logos coming to us, as well as the people that we have been able to approach and upsell on as existing customers. In terms of who we replace. I think that fundamentally, the zero trust network architecture is a just different way of doing networking. In the past, the way that you would construct a corporate network is you would build a castle, build a moat around that castle, and you put all your secrets inside the castle, you'd make all your employees come to work in the castle. And then anyone that was they had to live outside the castle would cross over a drawbridge. Those drawbridges are VPN, the moat is a firewall, the next generation firewall types of companies, intrusion detection companies, data loss protection companies, typically, they were the folks that sold boxes that define that moat or allowed access to those drawbridges to get across it. As people are adopting a zero trust model, they need a different approach to it. And so what we see often is people will maybe leave some of that in place, but that they will migrate more and more applications to this new approach. And over time, the budget dollars that new approach is coming from -- comes from those budget dollars that you would otherwise be buying that VPN, that firewall, that next generation firewall, the intrusion detection system, the data loss prevention system. That's really the teams\u2019 thesis. One, we extend also making sure that we have sort of a web application firewall component, and a DDoS mitigation component as well. And so that could either be boxes that people buy, or in some cases, it could be services provided by either the telecom or other companies that are sort of point cloud solution. Does that answer your question?\nAmit Daryanani: No, that is really helpful. And thank you very much. And I have to say, I appreciate the change of pace with some great hold music prior to the call. So thanks for that.\nMatthew Prince: Well, that was a really talented musician, guy named Jonah Cuddy. And he was accompanied by BB Stockwell. Jonah's a freshman at the Berkeley College of Music. I met him, in part because he's a proud Cloudflare shareholder. And we're excited to have him as a shareholder. And we've always really admired Shopify. They've been a great customer of ours for a long time. They've done this with Canadian bands and so it was great to convince the conference call folks to allow us to do it. So thanks for asking about it.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time, I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.\nMatthew Prince: Thanks, everyone. And again, I really wanted to thank the Cloudflare for team. It's been a really tough last couple of weeks as we've been on pins and needles, making sure that the U.S. election went as smoothly as possible. I'm proud to have played a small part in ensuring that that was the case. And I'm really proud of our entire team for making that happen. So, thank you, and we'll see you back here in next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thanks again to everyone for joining us. As Matthew mentioned, we delivered another outstanding quarter where we exceeded the high end of our guidance, and with that topline beat carrying through to our strong operating margin and another quarter of positive operating cash flow generation. Total revenue for the third quarter were 54% year-over-year to $114.2 million. The growth in revenue was driven by new logo acquisition as well as expansion within our existing customer base. Included in our Q3 revenue is a one-time catch up of $1.9 million related to a customer renewal. Excluding this, non-recurring revenue our year-over-year revenue growth would have been 52%. From a geographic perspective, we saw strong performance domestically and internationally, with particular strengths in the U.S. and EMEA both increasing 58% year-over-year. The U.S. represented 52% of revenue, while our international business represented 48% of revenue, and increased 31% year-over-year. Turning to our customer metrics, we exited the quarter with more than 3.2 million total free and paying customers, representing an increase of 40% year-over-year. In Q3, we achieved an exciting milestone of over 100,000 paying customers adding roughly 4800 sequentially. We also had another record quarter of large customer additions, which we define as paying customers with greater than $100,000 in annualized revenue, adding roughly 100 large customers sequentially and 285 large customers year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 736 large customers representing an increase of 63% year-over-year, with particular strengths in North America. We've shown 60% plus year-over-year large customer growth every quarter since the first quarter of 2018, with large customers now approaching almost half of our total revenue. Similar to our disclosure last quarter, roughly half of the 736 large customers have been on the platform for less than one year and the other half for more than one year. Our third quarter dollar base metric tension was 116%, which increased 100 basis points sequentially and decreased 500 basis points year-over-year. We saw acceleration in topline revenue growth this quarter, driven by both existing customers as well as new customers who have been on the platform for less than a year. Overall expansion from large enterprise customers was again strong this quarter, with six of our top 10 deals in terms of new ACBs coming from existing accounts. We expect D&R to trend flat to up going forward with teams as a potential tailwind for expansion opportunities. Third quarter gross margin was 77.3%, representing an increase of 50 basis points sequentially, and the decrease of 160 basis points year-over-year, which is in line with the expectations we shared last quarter in our long-term target of 75% to 77%. Turning to operating expenses, we remain focused on building a long-term business with a sustainable growth while improving the operating leverage in our business. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 5% sequentially, and 22% year-over-year to 81%. We had another strong hiring quarter, increasing our headcount by 42% year-over-year, and bringing our total number of employees to 1,697 in the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $51.2 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 8% sequentially, and 26% year-over-year. Sales and marketing as the percentage of revenue decreased to 45% from 48% last quarter, and 55% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $23.5 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 11% sequentially, and 17% year-over-year. R&D as a percentage of revenue remain flat sequentially, and decreased 21% from 27% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $18 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 3% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. G&A as a percentage of revenue was 16%, representing a decrease of 2% sequentially, and 6% year-over-year. Scaling our business efficiently remains a top priority and we continue to see acceleration in operating leverage in the third quarter. The operating margins improving over 2,000 basis points year-over-year, and 550 basis points sequentially. Operating loss was $4.5 million, compared to $18.1 million in the same period last year. We've been hiring aggressively and expect to continue to invest behind the success we see in topline revenue. Net loss in the quarter was $5.7 million, or net loss per share of $0.02. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was negative 22%. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $17.9 million, or 16% of revenue, compared to negative $33.6 million or 45% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was positive $2 million in the third quarter or 1.7% of revenue, which decreased $2 million sequentially and increased $19.8 million year-over-year. Q3 operating cash flow was held by an increase in cash profitability, while offset by our annual D&O insurance payment, as well as changes in working capital. Our DSOs trended down slightly quarter-over-quarter and remains well within the historical range. Q3 network CapEx was 11% of revenue, and we expect it to trend down as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter. Before moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year, I would like to provide another update on the COVID-related impacts and the associated provisions we shared last quarter. You may recall, in our first quarter earnings call we disclosed the customers highly affected by COVID-related challenges, particularly those the macro sensitive industries such as transportation, hospitality and retail represented 8% of our business. In Q2 and Q3, this cohort was 7% of total revenue. We are pleased to see these customers facing COVID-related challenges turn to us as Cloudflare plays a critical role for them, as they accelerate their digital transformation plans. We also disclosed last quarter that we saw customer concessions come in well below the $2 million headwind we anticipated, trending down during the quarter to historical levels. This trend remained consistent in the third quarter with both concessions and bad debt coming in below expectations. We repeat to observe another strong quarter of new ACV growth, increasing average customer spend, and high sales productivity. In Q3, we observed an acceleration in remaining performance obligations RPO, which was $342 million, representing an increase of 25% sequentially, and 81% year-over-year. A multiyear partnership agreement of $50 million contributed to the growth in RPO this quarter. So, it's not expected to materially contribute to revenue until 2021. Excluding this large partnership agreement, we saw 73% year-over-year RPO growth. Again, we had a great quarter. Our results demonstrate the resiliency and differentiation of our business model, which emphasizes customer diversity with no customer representing more than 5% of revenue, strong visibility and predictability with a vast majority of our revenue build upfront on a subscription basis, and multiple vectors of growth fueled by the massive scale and efficiency of our global cloud network. Given the momentum we are seeing, the ability of our model and our differentiation from competitors, we remain confident in the continued growth of our business, and as such, are pleased to raise guidance for both the quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $117.5 million to $118.5 million, representing an increase of 40% to 41% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $10 million to $9 million. And we expect net loss per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.03, assuming approximately 304 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of negative 13%. For the full year 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $422.5 million to $423.5 million, representing an increase of 47% to 48% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $38 million to $37 million. We expect net loss per share over the period in the range of $0.13 to $0.12, assuming approximately $300 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2020 of negative 12.4%. We'd also like to inform you that we will be hosting a Virtual Investor Day on February 12, 2021, where we look forward to providing a deep dive into our products and our platform. In addition, we'll also be providing an update on our financial progress and targets for fiscal 2021. In closing, I again want to thank our employees for delivering these great results and for the continued dedication to our customers and global community. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for question. Coming back for guidance, I think a couple of points to make. First of all, we are pleased to be able to raise our guidance, again, both for the quarter as well as for the year. A couple of things are coming together, the keen [ph] growth rate for the third quarter was 52%. And we look at Q4 with a really difficult compare, growing 51% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of last year. And we are still in the middle of the COVID crisis with maybe a second wave hitting, so there is also uncertainty in the market on how this is going to affect macro factors. So, I think what you see is prudent guidance that shows confidence in the business model, keeps the tough compare in mind, and let's not forget this gets us to a growth rate for the year of 47% to 48%. From a from a new ACV perspective, particularly strong quarter in North America. From a revenue production perspective, strong in both North America and Europe up to 58% year-over-year. Strong across all verticals, no vertical really that stood out very even performance across industrial, healthcare and other verticals."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. We had an exceptional quarter. In Q3, we crossed a number of significant milestones. First, we blew through $100 million in quarterly revenue, achieving $114 million, up 54% year-over-year. We crossed 100,000 paying customers ending the quarter with just shy of 101,000. For large customers in the quarter, we added nearly 100, 99 precisely and now has 736 spending more than $100,000 per year with us. These large customers accounted for 47% of our total revenue in Q3, and we anticipate they will make up more than half of our revenue going forward. One goal we had at the beginning of 2020 was to win our first $10 million customer on an annual run-rate basis. We're proud that we achieved that this quarter. That customer a Fortune 500 software company started with us in 2016, because one of their engineering leaders had used the free version of our service on his personal site. He loved the experience and brought us to work, initially signing a $60,000 per year contract. It's grown quite a bit since then. Today, this customer has tightly integrated our network and customized our products deep into their staff. It's been a terrific partnership, and we expect we will continue to grow alongside them. We've had great success with our go-to-market efforts and especially stunning large enterprise customers. About half of our new revenue in the quarter came from new logos and about half from expanding relationships with our existing customers. Even as we continue to sign a record number of large enterprise customers, we remain very happy with the diversity of our customer mix. None of our customers account for more than 5% of revenue. And our top 20 customers remain well under 20% of total revenue. While we're incredibly proud of our financial results and the strength of our business, I wanted to talk about something else, we're also really proud of. Our team watched the United States election this week carefully, as I'm sure many of you did as well. Well, there's still some uncertainty around the ultimate outcome. And there have been and will be stories around who voted and how those votes were counted. One story we worried about a lot going into the election that didn't materialize was the impact of cyber-attacks. We played some role in that. In 2016 that wasn't the case. Four years ago at Cloudflare we watched with deep concern as attackers were able to use various techniques to subvert parts of the election infrastructure and undermine competence in its results. We decided shortly after it was our duty to provide our technology and expertise to ensure cyber-attacks don't disrupt fair election. We launched the Athenian project, which provides our enterprise class service for free to any state or local government elections officials. We also partnered with a nonpartisan civil society organization defending digital campaign, to work with the Federal Election Commission, so we can provide our services at no cost to national campaign without violating campaign contribution laws. This year, more than half of U.S. states participated in the Athenian project that includes so called Red, Blue and Purple states. More than half of the battleground states used Cloudflare in order to protect services like voter registration, poll location, precinct reporting, and official results. We worked both presidential campaigns and many of the Federal candidates for Congress. We were able to fend off cyber-attacks and saw no instances in which they impacted the ability of citizens to learn about candidates or to vote. That's a big step up from 2016. Well, democracy can be messy inherently depends on a process you can trust. We're proud of the small role we played in defending the democratic process. Switching to the other topic that continues to be top of mind for all of us, November will be the ninth month, most of the world has been impacted by COVID-19. While it's not in our nature to take victory laps, I wanted to pause to recognize our team and their ability to execute during these difficult times. Early in 2020, we began to see challenges sourcing equipment for our network, as the virus hit our Asia-based suppliers. Then, in late-March, traffic across our network spiked as the world shifted to working from home. In two weeks, we saw more than 50% growth in traffic, more than we had forecast for 12 months. At the same time, our team had to adjust to working remotely. Product managers and engineers had to figure out how to develop innovative new products without gathering around a physical whiteboard. Our go-to-market teams had to adjust to selling to customers without ever meeting them in-person. And we had to learn how to continue to hire and onboard great new members of our team without them ever stepping into an office. It would have been easy for them to step in any of these areas because our businesses stall, but our team has executed and our business has thrived. We've been able to continue to build out our network to meet the unprecedented demand for our services, while staying within our CapEx budget. Even though we charge almost exclusively on a fixed subscription basis, we were able to meet our gross margin target, hitting 77% Q3, without depriving our customers with burgeoning bills. And we'd exceeded our ambitious revenue goals actually accelerating growth, while continue to sign up larger and larger enterprise customers. We were prudent at the beginning of the pandemic, reserving for potential customer allowances and bad debt. And we've worked with a subset of our customers who have struggled during the pandemic, to ensure they always had a reliable network they can afford, knowing to being accommodating today with bias loyalty over the long-term. We've been fortunate that when our customers sort vendors, we've been sorted in the bucket of differentiated must have services. As a result, we've not seen pricing pressure and we've had fewer concessions and less bad debt than we forecast. We've also been able to hire great people. In Q2, we've received more than 40,000 applications and extended offers to a mere 0.6%. In Q3, we had over 60,000 and extended offers only 0.4%. An investor last quarter asked why that was an important statistic for us to mention? Companies are just collections of people, and we believe whatever company is able to attract and retain the best people will win. That we can organically attract so many great candidates, means we can save money by not having to hire third party recruiters. We can source candidates from less expensive geographies in order to achieve operational leverage, while still adding headcount to realize our ambitious plan, and we're more likely to have a diverse team with different outlooks, who will come up with solutions to problem that no one had dreamed up before. While COVID has created challenges for our team, it has also made our mission of helping build a better internet, resonate with team members and customers more than ever before. The world has never needed a better internet more than it has over the last nine months. And our team wakes up excited every day to deliver exactly that for our customers. In the last four months, we've been on a tear releasing a ton of incredible new products. We announced more than one product per day around Cloudflare workers, our serverless computing platform during the week of July 26. We celebrated our birthday during the week of September 27, with a series of products that are less about directly generating revenue, and more about doing the right thing for the internet. And more recently, we fleshed out our vision for Cloudflare teams with a new architecture called Cloudflare One over the week of October 11, which we dubbed the zero trust week. These weeks leverage one of our superpowers, engineering and marketing, and may result in significant spikes in organic inbound interest from potential customers. In fact, during zero trust week, organic inbound leads more than doubled of their already elevated level. Stay tuned, we have one more Cloudflare week before the end of the year focused on privacy and compliance. I wanted to drill into two products I know there's a lot of interest in, Cloudflare for teams and workers, first team. We launched by Cloudflare for teams in January and it happened to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time, as the world shifted to remote work and needed a scalable cloud based VPN and firewall replacement. Seeing how many businesses were struggling with the shift to remote work, we made the call to make teams free through September 1. We have thousands of companies ranging from small businesses to fortune 500 corporations take us up on our offer. Over the course of Q3, we began conversations with all of them to transition from the free offer to becoming paying customers. We are happy with how that went. 75% of customers transitioned from free to paid accounts that included some great new logos like JetBlue Travel Products, OneTrust and Delivery Hero. For some customers, who are still particularly hard to get by COVID, we allowed them to continue with the free offering until they can get their feet back under them. Teams is a very high margin product for us, so this doesn't cost us much. And as I said before, we've always found that doing the right thing by our customers paid back in spades over the long-term. Because the converted accounts transition came late in the quarter, and because teams seat based pricing tends to be even more land small and then expand in some of our other products, these new converted customers did not result in material additional revenue in Q3. However, the other benefits of running this program is how much it accelerated our learning curve. We had positioned teams as nearly all our competitors have with an asset management product we call Cloudflare access, and internet gateway products we call software gateway. What we learned since March is that customers wanted a more holistic solution. If you adopted zero trust networking model, you need an access and gateway component, but you inherently then are exposing more of your infrastructure to the internet, so you also need products like our web application firewall and DDoS mitigation. We also learned that by leveraging products like Argo Smart Routing and Magic Transit, we can provide a much higher quality of service unmatched by traditional zero trust vendors and delivering on the real promise of SD-WAN. These conversations with customers over the last nine months helped us realize there's an opportunity to package our services, with the addition of intrusion detection, next generation firewall and data loss protection, which we announced during zero trust week into a comprehensive solution that we believe can help define the future of the corporate network. We've dubbed this Cloudflare one, and we believe it's the sweet that is unmatched in the market. Turning to Cloudflare workers, it's incredibly exciting to see to have the platform is taking off. In Q3, more than 27,000 developers wrote and deployed their first Cloudflare worker, that's up from 15,000 a year ago. History proves with new computing platforms the more developers they have, the more quickly they improve and the more likely they are to win. Looking at GitHub and other sources of data on developer engagement, we believe more developers write and deploy real applications and code on Cloudflare workers every month, than every other edge computing platform combined. So, what are they building? One of the most viewed publications during the 2020 elections use Cloudflare workers to power their elections news platform, and ensure its scale during the unprecedented spike in traffic last Tuesday, as well as Wednesday and today. A popular health food company uses workers to power their online ordering system. An online marketing firm working with major brands uses workers to customize content on a per visitor basis. A publicly traded electronics testing firm uses workers to break their on-premise and cloud based infrastructure. An innovative start-up is using workers to power an online crypto scavenger hunt. And one of the largest online learning platforms uses workers to deliver their customized content during this time of skyrocketing demand. It's great to see more used cases every quarter, I think we're just scratching the surface. Most used cases today have focused on performance. Over time, I expect those use cases will pale in comparison to what is a much bigger opportunity, helping customers manage the challenges of compliance. As governments around the world increasingly insist on data localization and data residency, sending all your users data back to AWS feeds for processing will become unacceptable. What our largest, most sophisticated, most compliant sensitive customers are looking to workers for, is as a way to manage this increasingly complex regulatory environment. That's why during Cloudflare's birthday week, our announcement of durable objects may have been one of the most important edge computing developments you may have met. Durable object allows developers to define a data structure and store it faithfully on our network, close to users that need to access it in order to ensure performance and consistency. It also allows developers to define where that data can move across our network, and where it cannot, such as this users data may never leave the EU or this user's data may Brazil. Given Cloudflare's network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries worldwide, durable objects provides fine grained control over where data is stored and processed. That functionality is critical for the increasingly complex compliance challenges that face every global company today. In other words, the future of edge computing will be defined as much by intelligent edge storage as it is by computing. And while others are still working to launch their edge computing platforms, we have products like durable objects in market that are defining that future today. Before I hand it off to Thomas, I wanted to close by talking about three more fortune 500 large enterprise customers, whose business we won in Q3. A fortune 500 industrial manufacturing company came to us to consolidate multiple vendors and products into a single unified platform. They replaced discrete network optimization, load balancing and bot management vendors with Cloudflare, in order to in a [indiscernible] have a single pane of glass to understand and control what's happening on their network. They signed a $1.4 million annual contract in Q3. A Fortune 500 food and beverage company came to us following a security audit, they replaced their legacy network optimization service with Cloudflare. They use most of Cloudflare's core services including workers. They were looking to save money over their previous vendor and were able to cut their spend in half, while still being a very attractive customer for us. They signed a half a million dollar annual contract with us in Q3. Finally, a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company adopted the Cloudflare One architecture to protect their employees and global network. They were able to onboard 47,000 employees and contractors and more than 130 applications on the Cloudflare One. They were particularly impressed with the comprehensive solution as well as ease of use. They called out how much our solution reduced their internal IT support ticket load. They signed a $1.5 million annual contract in Q3. Sometimes you hit on all cylinders. We had one of those quarters. I wanted to take a second to thank the whole Cloudflare team, who are working hard to make Thomas and my job easy. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Yes. Phil, thanks for the question. I think that our traditional products that are kind of the tip of the spear continue to be case. So we saw a large number of companies that were coming under cyber-attack in Q3, that would turn to us. Originally, there's been our DDoS mitigation products. Increasingly, we're putting entire networks behind us using our Magic Transit product. And that has been extremely well received. I think the new addition to that which is really driving more and more initial interest to people coming to us for what we call our Cloudflare Teams product. So that's our access and gateway product. Pardon the pun but that has turned into a gateway for us to get more large customers onboard. And I think the thing that has surprised us over the course of the last nine months, as we really have been talking with those initial customers, and getting feedback is how much club those products that existed before the teams products, really actually dovetail nicely with the rest of the teams products. And so we're seeing a lot of times where someone will come to us for say, Cloudflare access and gateway, but then realize that they need a web application firewall, DDoS mitigation, and that's really been a differentiator for us versus a lot of the other zero trust vendors that are in the market. Yes. I think that we've always seen the vision for Cloudflare as building the future of the enterprise network. It's why when we take our symbol we didn't pick Cloudflare, we picked NET, because we think that we are the future of the network. And the individual products are really coming together. And we allow companies to adopt just the portions that makes sense for them. But what we realized is that the kaleidoscope of all of our different products, and the picture that they form together really is a compelling value proposition. And I think what differentiates us then is, first of all, the ease of use across all of those different products. Secondly, the unified control plane where you're not having to go to a number of different vendors. And finally that it can be significantly cost effective. And that last piece has been a big driver as CIOs and CTOs are looking to consolidate vendors, looking to simplify their deployment and looking to solve some of the budgeting problems they have. And we were there to help them with those issues. Yes. We're tracking very carefully that developer engagement of workers as a whole. And the fact that we hit 27,000 developers, that's not people who've created accounts, but that's actually written code and deployed it across our network. So they really have some skin in the game. And that's been a real involvement. Across our customers as we sign the percentage that adopt workers are holding pretty steady, around 20% of new customers coming onboard on a contracted basis are adopting the workers platform. As we've talked about before, we think that there is really kind of a short, medium and long-term opportunity for workers. The short-term opportunity that makes all of our existing products, the most programmable and configurable version in the market. So the most programmable firewall, the most programmable zero trust solution, the most programmable load balancer, that's what workers really delivers. And that's where the bulk of the sort of new customers are coming from. The medium-term solution is that it is a platform that allows our own team to innovate as quickly as we have. So all Cloudflare for teams was built using the workers platform. And we really think that the best development platform, the first best customer of those platforms is the company that builds them themselves. And that's the role that we're following. And the long-term opportunity, which, frankly, as I see that more and more sophisticated applications are being written and we gave a number of examples on the call. But what I'm really excited about is how the sort of large financial institution, healthcare organization, consumer applications that are existing on a global basis. Those companies with really sophisticated compute needs aren't cheap, increasingly seeing workers as a platform that they can do something with that they really can't do on any other platform. So we've been really happy with it. Again, I think it's going to be sort of a short, medium and long-term opportunity, but the long-term keeps getting closer-and-closer every day. I'm glad you asked me the easy question and Thomas the hard question. So thank you for that. So the $10 million customers Brent, as I mentioned a customer with us since 2016. I think the thing that we see over and over again, is that not only organizations but individuals that fall in love with us for our pay as you go and even our free products often will then bring us to work. And that has allowed us to very quickly build a very loyal fan base in almost every IT organization in the world. And it really differentiates us. That customer is using us for a number of our web performance as well as our security products. They tend to be our older products, the products around DDoS mitigation WAF, and others. They're increasingly looking at adopting other products across their platform, including bot management and maybe even our Cloudflare for teams products. So, I think that we have been able to grow with them. We have become a key part of their network. We are able to continue, there are a number of different ways we can continue to expand their relationship with that customer. And I think that while this is the first of our $10 million customers, they're, we think that with anyone who's a Fortune 500 company, there's an opportunity for us to have a similar level of penetration. Yes, I appreciate the questions. So, I think that we have a very diversified go-to-market strategy. We are able to sign people up on a come in put in your credit card. But as we said in previous calls and it's continue to be the case, on this. In Q3, that is a smaller and smaller percentage of our revenue. And today it is well under 20% of revenue. And I think it has as we've written about in our founders letter and the F1 and the updated founders letter that we wrote before, being able to serve everyone and being able to build relationships with those individuals and those developers that can sign-up for their own account, even though it doesn't account for a substantial portion of our revenue, it has driven a lot of marketing benefits and it gives us a really strong relationship and a really developer love, which helps us when we're trying to win those large customers. In terms of sales capacity, we continue to move up market. We support customers. We don't believe that you can do what we do without having a sales team. And so we started with an inside sales team, early on in Cloudflare's history. We now increasingly have a direct sales team with experienced sales leaders that have come from other enterprise companies that have really been able to thrive over time. And I think one of the people who's been very helpful in this is Mark Anderson on our Board, who obviously came from a number of great enterprise sales organization. That's what has allowed us to continue to scale. So, we have great sales capacity. We've been hiring. One of the things has been amazing is that during this time, when a lot of people have pulled back hiring, we've actually stepped on the gas, and the caliber of the team as a whole and in particular, the caliber of the team that we're being able to attract in our field sales organization, really, I think is you're going to look back and say, wow, there was an incredible opportunity that they had during this particular time, and they took advantage of it. I think that our thought on identity has been that we really think partnering is the right place. Companies have largely made their best on what their identity management. Companies are going to be and so we're working with great companies like Okta, PingIdentity, Microsoft, in order to integrate their existing identity solutions. One of the things though, that we think its powerful and that we're hearing from customers, is that they often tend not to have one identity provider, they might have their contractors using one provider and their internal employees using another. And that could either be just because the complexity of running a business, it could be because of M&A activity. But what's powerful about the Cloudflare for teams product, and especially our access and gateway product, is that they can really rationalize the complexity of those various identity providers and say, you can mix and match of the plus Microsoft Active Directory, plus what might be a more consumer facing identity provider for contractors like a LinkedIn or a GitHub, and use one control plane provided by Cloudflare in order to deliver that. So I think that's an area, I think it's unlikely that we will go into directly. I think it's an area we're much more likely to partner in, but I think it is a way that we can help simplify the complex setup that a number of people have. Thanks. Yes. So, Matt, I appreciate it. We're really excited about Cloudflare One, and I think it is an emerging area for us. So when we published a few weeks ago, what was effectively the schematic for what we think of as the enterprise's the future. It really resonated with the market and a number of people, reached out to it. But it was conversations with customers that got us there. And we had traditionally thought of kind of Cloudflare for teams, and a lot of our other infrastructure products as being separate. But in retrospect it's kind of one of those forehead slapping moments where you realize that, these things go together like [Indiscernible] and HERSHEY'S Chocolate and the Marshmallow together creates this incredible thing which is better than the sum of its parts, it's more. And that gives us incredible opportunity for us to build something which really resonates with customers. Right now, we priced the various components of Cloudflare One individually, but one of the things that we think we're investigating is whether we can take what is effectively an architecture and turn it into a skew. And in that case, what we're investigating is there a way that we can bundle together a number of Cloudflare products, and sell them on just a per seat basis. And we think that that's really attractive on both ends of the market on one end and the low end of the market that allows us to get more of our features into start-ups, early stage companies, and really have them have the best possible architecture from early in their history. For larger companies, what we're seeing is that there's an opportunity for us both to help them rationalize a number of different vendors, and then hopefully, also allow us to grow with them. And so I think it's, it's a space to continue to watch, I don't think we know exactly how that's going to come together. But we do think that it is a real opportunity to both simplify the deployment of our customers, and help them have a very significant ROI with their deployment. We've really resisted, when we put together any TAM forecasts or anything else we've resisted. We've resisted kind of calling out what that is, because I think it's tough to say. Maybe this is a little bit heretical. But, I actually think that if the only advantage of workers is it's a little bit faster that the TAM is not that big. And while, I understand that there's a lot of excitement around edge computing, and Gartner will throw out a really large number. If you actually talk to developers, their priorities making something a little bit faster is sort of the last in their sort of hierarchy of needs. Whereas they have other things around ease of use, more affordability and reliability. The opportunity that I think is the biggest one, which I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is really around, how can we help companies with what is an increasingly regulatory compliance situation. So, if you imagine in the future, that what the folks at TikTok are living through what Facebook is increasingly facing in Europe, that comes to every business that is operating on a global basis, where the data for their customers is required to be kept in market and process in market, then there really isn't another platform on the market that can provide that solution without cobbling together a bunch of things. And if in the future, you've got 100 different laws in 100 different countries, then you need a network that spans 100 different countries. And I think that that's the real opportunity for workers. It's early there. But when we look at our largest, most sophisticated customers, that's where they're saying, this is a real opportunity. This is where we want you to invest. And that's why our team is investing in that area. Yes. Keith, so let me take those in order. So, from the upside perspective, I think because of the nature of our business, where we're a subscription business, the seeds that a lot of this got planted early in the quarter and late in last quarter. And we just had a very, very strong growth across all of our various components of our business. I will say that as we tried to emphasize in the prepared remarks, the large customer segment, those customers that are over $100,000 and also those customers that are over $1 million, we're seeing more adoption from those customers. We're also seeing that we're getting more expansion from those large customers. And sometimes that expansion is actually coming so fast that it's happening within the year. And so it isn't yet reflected in our dollar base net retention numbers. So I think that, as I said, we hit on all cylinders here. And I'm really proud of the team, I think they did an incredible job delivering the quarter that we had, and it really was a team effort. And I don't think it was any one thing, but it was a combination of many different factors working out very well. On the teams side, I think those are typically annual contracts. We are in some cases signing longer-term contracts, but they are typically annual contracts. And we think that this is a newer product of having a little bit of flexibility to revisit pricing is makes sense, and it gives customers flexibility as well. And then it depends on various organizations. So some organizations are having very broad adoption across their entire team, someone like a Delivery Hero. That was a substantial adoption across their entire platform. Others are small businesses where they might adopt across the entire platform, but there aren't all that many seats. But because we've made the product so easy to use, we can service that into the market, we really don't have any competition at that part of the market. And then we sometimes see individual team, but what we've learned is that oftentimes when somebody adopts teams within an individual team, that that then spreads in an organization very well. And so we think it's actually the teams product is a real tailwind for our dollar based net retention. And it gives a very natural expansion motion over time for us, which is we think is really exciting. Sure, so I can start with those and then Thomas can add a little bit more color. So, I think our goal is to continuously be releasing new products so that the take rate on any given customer, even if they had adopted everything that we had yesterday, is we'll have new stuff for them tomorrow. And I think if you're not following our blog already, just the rate of innovation, the rate of the team has been able to continue to adapt and deliver products is really outstanding. And we're seeing that that is one of the many components that is driving our continued ability to grow and scale. It's really different on different customers in terms of what the take rate for the products are. But we do naturally see products that fit together fairly well. So the teams products fit very well with our DDoS and our web application firewall product. We're seeing a lot of interest over the last two quarters in our Magic Transit product, that tends to be a great again, tip of the spear product for us to come in with. But once somebody's entire network is behind us, that then allows us to approach them and talk about teams and some of the other products as well. So the journey into Cloudflare can come in many different directions. But we're really happy with again our ability to continue to innovate, continue to add to the platform and see the adoption of these new products by our existing customers. Sure. So, access is priced on a per seat basis and there are various tiers of that pricing. And so, the dimensions will be how many employees do they have on their organization and then what tier of that cloud service are they adopting. And so that could be, as low as a few dollars per seat, it could be as high as tens of dollars per seat. And it depends on exactly what their deployment is. But we are now seeing six plus figure deals that are just for Cloudflare teams. And again, we think it has a natural expansion on two direction, both when customers grow and then also, when we convinced those customers to adopt a higher per seat tier. Yes, it was a couple thousand customers took us up on the free teams offer. Just to be 100% clear, we have also extended a free offer for small organizations and small team, which we which we plan to continue indefinitely. And we think that that's a really great gateway to get startups and smaller organizations onto the platform. So I think you were asking about the free offer that we made back in March, but there is this other free offer that will continue to expand over the long-term. In terms of the people that took us up on the free offer, it really was across the board. We mentioned a handful of what a relatively large organization that are part of this. There were much larger organizations as well, that came in through that funnel. I would say the majority would reflect what is sort of a typical distribution of sizes of companies. So we would have a lot of small businesses that are in that mix. But then a handful of Fortune 500 and very large customers as well. Sure. So I think that actually somewhat opposite how we went to market with a lot of Cloudflare's other products. We're actually seeing for Cloudflare One and the products that make up Cloudflare One more interest in the larger enterprise segment first, and then we're trying to pull that down to small businesses. We don't see really any competition in the self service, pay as you go segment. And so we think that that's an area that we can really, help define what the standard is, and that that will be a fertile ground. But if we look at the people the organizations that are adopting Cloudflare One, if you look at the leads that were generated from that interest in it, it really has been the much larger end of the of the customer set, both in terms of new logos coming to us, as well as the people that we have been able to approach and upsell on as existing customers. In terms of who we replace. I think that fundamentally, the zero trust network architecture is a just different way of doing networking. In the past, the way that you would construct a corporate network is you would build a castle, build a moat around that castle, and you put all your secrets inside the castle, you'd make all your employees come to work in the castle. And then anyone that was they had to live outside the castle would cross over a drawbridge. Those drawbridges are VPN, the moat is a firewall, the next generation firewall types of companies, intrusion detection companies, data loss protection companies, typically, they were the folks that sold boxes that define that moat or allowed access to those drawbridges to get across it. As people are adopting a zero trust model, they need a different approach to it. And so what we see often is people will maybe leave some of that in place, but that they will migrate more and more applications to this new approach. And over time, the budget dollars that new approach is coming from -- comes from those budget dollars that you would otherwise be buying that VPN, that firewall, that next generation firewall, the intrusion detection system, the data loss prevention system. That's really the teams' thesis. One, we extend also making sure that we have sort of a web application firewall component, and a DDoS mitigation component as well. And so that could either be boxes that people buy, or in some cases, it could be services provided by either the telecom or other companies that are sort of point cloud solution. Does that answer your question? Well, that was a really talented musician, guy named Jonah Cuddy. And he was accompanied by BB Stockwell. Jonah's a freshman at the Berkeley College of Music. I met him, in part because he's a proud Cloudflare shareholder. And we're excited to have him as a shareholder. And we've always really admired Shopify. They've been a great customer of ours for a long time. They've done this with Canadian bands and so it was great to convince the conference call folks to allow us to do it. So thanks for asking about it. Thanks, everyone. And again, I really wanted to thank the Cloudflare for team. It's been a really tough last couple of weeks as we've been on pins and needles, making sure that the U.S. election went as smoothly as possible. I'm proud to have played a small part in ensuring that that was the case. And I'm really proud of our entire team for making that happen. So, thank you, and we'll see you back here in next quarter."

Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jayson. We had a very strong quarter. Our Q2 revenue came in just shy of $100 million, up 48% year-over-year. We saw strength from our customers of all sizes. We grew our large customer accounts, those paying us more than $100,000 annually by 65% year-over-year. We also added nearly 7,000 new paying customers, bringing our total paying customer count to over 90,000. At the same time, we saw strong growth across our existing customer base as they adopted more features of the Cloudflare platform. While we are very happy with our results, our nature is always to be on the lookout for what could go wrong. As I talked about last quarter, we were concerned about concessions and the risk of bad debt caused as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while we are not out of the woods. We see good reasons to be optimistic. COVID-related concession requests peaked in early April and had been tailed off. We came in well below what we forecast for potential downside. Today, much more so than on our last earnings call, we feel, we have clear visibility into the effects of the pandemic on our business that has given us the confidence as Thomas will detail to raise both our Q3 and our annual guidance. That competence comes foundationally from our very predictable and consistent business model. The vast majority of our revenue, more than 95% we\u2019ve built upfront on a subscription basis that generally gives us good visibility into our future results. Another consequence appears to have been and we saw the peak in customer concession requests earlier than other companies that fill in arrears on a more volatile usage basis. One thing we are seeing increasingly is customers who were surprised by their large usage based bills that other vendors now coming to us for predictable consistent pricing. No one likes to be surprised by a bill. And we believe the consistency of our staff approach is not only more predictable for us, but also builds trust and wins loyal customers over the long-term. While concessions ended up lower than we had forecasted, I\u2019m proud of how our team works to accommodate those of our customers that were struggling due to COVID. These are tough times for many businesses. Great partnerships are often filled during tough times and consistency and predictability are especially valued, but then so much else seems uncertain. The customers I\u2019ve talked to, they\u2019ve been thankful that we\u2019ve been there as a good reliable partner with them through the challenges over the last five months. For our own business, we are relentlessly paranoid. So we\u2019ve been watching a handful of metrics in order to help understand the impact of these unusual times. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, our sales cycle has kicked up by a few days in Q1 and trended back down in Q2 and remains well under a quarter and at the low end of our historic range. We\u2019re worried sales productivity made slow as our team adapted to working remotely. Instead, sales productivity per ramped rep hit a new record high. Deeper into the weeds, we watch our receivable collection period closely. We speculated that as businesses struggled during the pandemic, our collection period may lengthen. We were pleasantly surprised to see our collections period stay stable over the last two quarters. So what\u2019s going on? We believe the pandemic force companies distort their vendors into two buckets, nice to have and must have. All indications from the quantitative metrics we\u2019re watching as well as the qualitative conversations we\u2019re having with customers are that Cloudflare is squarely in the must have bucket. Of course, we are part of the larger global economy and less we forget we\u2019re still in the midst of a global pandemic. So lots of risks remain, but we see no indication that we are really uniquely exposed to the effects of the crisis, quite the opposite. For example, for new customers, segments that have traditionally been slow to adopt the cloud are increasingly embracing their digital transformation and turning to us for help. In Q2, we saw particular strength in Europe, industrial companies and small businesses. Those are not the first three segments you think about when you think about cloud adoption. And yet COVID has caused even those segments of customers that traditionally are slow to change to adapt in order to survive. The nimbleness of our go-to-market team and our short sales cycles have allowed us to adjust our playbook and be there for new customers in these segments, as they unexpectedly accelerated their digital and network transformation plans. It also helps the customers need our services more than ever. We talked last earnings call about the incredible increase in consumption of internet services generally. The global growth of internet traffic largely plateaued in Q2 and we believe it will remain largely flat in Q3. What did not plateau were cyber attacks. We\u2019ve blocked 37% more cyber attacks per day for the same cohort of customers in Q2 than Q1. I think of that metric as our cyber attack equivalent of same-store sales. You include new customers to growth in mitigated attacks with 53%, when companies based online cyber threats, they increasingly turn immediately to Cloudflare. May was the busiest month the internet has ever seen for distributed denial of service attacks. We saw an attack against one of our customers that lasted four days and peaked at more than 750 million packets per second, our network didn\u2019t flinch. The targeted customers\u2019 infrastructure never slowed down and they weren\u2019t even aware until our systems alerted them. Suffice it to say none of us expected 2020 to work out the way it has. I\u2019m thankful for our team and our technologies flexibility and proud of all the customers we\u2019ve helped ensure have a fast, reliable and secure internet through these challenging times. I swore at the last earnings call, where I literally repeated the word four time, I would never again call anything unprecedented, but here we are. Back in April, I spoke to our team in our Q2 kickoff. I emphasized that great companies use crises to focus on what\u2019s most important, but also to invest in the future, while others pull back. Our team rose to that challenge. It\u2019s been incredible to see the rate of innovation that has continued and in fact, accelerated, even as we\u2019ve had to adapt to a new work environment. One place you can measure that investment is in hiring. Unlike many others in the industry, we did not slow down. We hired 257 new team members in Q2, which is a record for us and ahead of our hiring plan. But what\u2019s behind those numbers is even more impressive. We had nearly 47,000 applicants up 750% year-over-year. If you do the math, that means we extended offers to less than 0.6% of applicants. We had a 96% offer acceptance rate company-wide and then 99% rate in our sales organization. The talent we\u2019re seeing is incredible. My parents were proud when I got into HBS, turns out the odds of getting a job at Cloudflare these days are much harder. When 18 months from now you hear about some incredible new feature or a big customer win know that the investment in the people who made that happen came during this time, when we stepped on the gas, while others were pumping the brakes. Even as we made these investments, we continue to make substantial progress on our path toward profitability. This quarter, we delivered nearly 2000 basis points in operating leverage year-over-year. And even as we saw unprecedented spike in traffic and cyber attacks, our gross margins remain north of 76% and within our long-term target model. But of course, there\u2019s no metric more important to judging the health of any business and its ability to win the trust of new customers. To that end, I wanted to walk through a handful of customer stories for the quarter. One of the largest and oldest European financial services firm signed a three-year deal with $450,000 per year for Cloudflare for Teams, our zero trust cloud-based replacing or legacy VPNs and firewalls. They talked to many of the major zero trust five security players, and chose Cloudflare for the capabilities that our current offering, as well as what they described as our future proof roadmap. We believe there will be an opportunity to further expand this customer as our browser isolation technology is rolled out in the second half of this year. A large U.S.-based industrial manufacturer signed a deal with $350,000 per year to adopt Cloudflare\u2019s web application firewall solution. They were moving to the cloud as part of their digital transformation, replacing legacy on-premise hardware and saw Cloudflare is a clear winner in cloud security. Having established a trusted relationship with them last quarter, this quarter, we are talking to them about adopting our Cloudflare for team solutions for their 50,000 employees. A leading identity and access management provider signed a two-year deal worth a $0.5 million per year. They\u2019ve moved workloads away from Amazon Web Services due to better speed and flexibility of our platform. They are part of a general trend, we are seeing from the most security savvy organizations, who tell us they trust publish platform, respect our team, will leave in our ability to continue to innovate and embedding on our technology. A Born In The Cloud gaming platform signed an expansion of their existing Cloudflare contract for an additional $1.8 million annually. This platform, which you have kids at home, they\u2019re almost certainly using shows Cloudflare to ensure the best possible experience for all their users worldwide. I\u2019ve been excited to watch how they use Cloudflare Workers, our serverless computing platform to scale and empower the explosive growth they\u2019ve seen over the first half of 2020. That\u2019s one great example of Cloudflare Workers customer. But I wanted to finish by giving you a picture of how developers generally are adopting our serverless computing platform. Cloudflare Workers launched nearly three years ago. Part of what was powerful about Workers was that it was a true turning complete serverless computing platform that allowed developers to build sophisticated applications and run them edge to edge across our entire network. Today, approximately 10% of traffic going through Cloudflare network is powered by Workers. About 20% of new large customer deals include Workers. And in Q2 alone, 22,000 new developers wrote their first application using Workers up 440% year-over-year. We\u2019re not satisfied being just a niche edge computing platform. We want to be the go-to-serverless computing platform for all developers and applications. To that end, last week, we announced a number of new Cloudflare Workers features. We significantly raised CPU limit, allowing customers to build even more sophisticated applications. We released pricing that is up to 75%, less expensive for the same workloads than AWS Lambda, while still being margin accretive for us. And we expanded our tools to support the languages developers already know and love like JavaScript, C, C++, Python, Rust, Scala and even COBOL. While I\u2019m excited to see, as the developers choosing Cloudflare Workers, aren\u2019t doing so just because it\u2019s the fastest, but also because it\u2019s the most consistent, secure, cost-effective computing platform. It\u2019s easy for them to use and help solve the thorny global compliance issues, their CIO is increasingly care about, watch this space. As Michelle likes to say, we\u2019re just getting started. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Thomas to walk through our financial results for the quarter. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew. And thanks again to everyone for joining us. As Matt mentioned, we continued the momentum from our first quarter. So less headwinds from the COVID pandemic than previously anticipated and deliver another outstanding quarter with strengths in multiple areas of the business. Total revenue for the second quarter grew 48% year-over-year to $99.7 million. The growth in revenue was driven by another quarter of strong customer demand, both in terms of new logo acquisition, as well as expansion within our existing customer base. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 49% of revenue and increased 46% year-over-year. Our international business represented 51% of revenue and increased 50% year-over-year. International growth was driven primarily by EMEA, which saw record year-over-year growth of 62% helped by new product adoption from large enterprises. Turning to our customer metrics, we exited the quarter with more than 3 million total free and paying customers, representing an increase of 40% year-over-year. As a reminder, beginning last quarter, we shifted to revenue-based KPIs and away from billings as the basis for all KPIs. We added the record number of large and paying customers in the second quarter on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. We added approximately 7,000 paying customers in the second quarter, bringing the total number of paying customers to over 96,000. We added more than 80 large customers sequentially ending the quarter with 637 paying customers, which was greater than $100,000 in annualized revenue, which is up 65% year-over-year, roughly, half of the 637 large customers, testing on the platform for more than a year and the other half for less than one-year. For second quarter, dollar-based net retention was 115%, which decrease 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by non-strategic accounts in Asia Pacific that turned off our platform. Outside of the Asia Pacific region, overall expansion in the quarter from large enterprise customers was strong, with nine of our top 10 deals, in terms of newer ACV coming from existing accounts. A meaningful number of large expansion deals came from customers that haven\u2019t yet been on the platform for a year, and therefore, have yet to contribute to dollar net retention. We view this as a healthy indication of our ability to expand our new customers quickly and expect this trend to continue into the second half of 2020. Second quarter gross margin was 76.8%, down 150 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points year-over-year, which is in line with the expectations we shared last quarter and our long-term target of 75% to 77%. We have been able to absorb Internet traffic levels 30% to 40% higher than pre-COVID without a significant impact to gross margin. Turning to operating expenses, we remain focused on building a long-term business with a sustainable growth, while improving the operating leverage in our business. Second quarter operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 8% sequentially, and 20% year-over-year to 86%. As Matthew mentioned, we achieved record hiring in the second quarter with a focus on key geographies like Austin and Lisbon increasing our headcount by 44% year-over-year and bringing our total number of employees to 1,535 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $47.4 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 9% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. Sales and marketing, as a percentage of revenue, remained flat at 48% sequentially and decreased 5% year-over-year. To add to what Matthew mentioned, where the record quarter in terms of sales hiring, including quota bearing reps, which is important as we look out to fiscal year 2021. Research and development expenses were $21.3 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 4% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. R&D, as the percentage of revenue, decreased to 21% from 22% last quarter and 27% in the same quarter last year. We\u2019ve seen excellent progress building out our Lisbon office, which we expect to contribute to long term R&D leverage. G&A expenses were $17.4 million for the quarter, representing a decrease of 21% sequentially and constant year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower than expected bad debt expense and the reduction in events and office expenses. G&A, as the percentage of revenue, was 17%, representing a decrease of 7% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. We continue to see operating leverage in the business as operating margin improved by over 1,800 basis points year-over-year and 600 basis points sequentially. Operating loss was $9.5 million in the second quarter, compared to $18.7 million in the same period last year. We accelerated hiring the second quarter in order to remain on track to achieve full hiring plans and as such expect to see variations in the magnitude of operating leverage going forward. Net lost in the quarter was $9.6 million or net loss per share of $0.03. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was negative 12.2%. We have strong and flexible balance sheet ending the second quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Early in the quarter, we issued a $575 million convertible note offering with total net proceeds of $562 million. In connection with the offering, we bought a capped call with 100% premium in order to protect our common shareholders from dilution. Second quarter free cash flow was negative $20.2 million or 20% of revenue compared to the negative $16.9 million or 25% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was positive $4 million in the second quarter. The improvement was primarily to create profitability and improve working capital help by strong collections. Our DSOs remained well within the historical range, which we view as encouraging against a recessionary environment. We expect to see variability in operating cash flow due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital and the growth in our enterprise business. Before moving to guidance for the third quarter and full year, as I would like to provide an update on the COVID related impacts and associated provisions we shared last quarter. Last quarter, we disclosed that customers\u2019 highly affected by COVID-related challenges, particularly those in macro-sensitive industries, such as transportation, hospitality and retail, represented approximately 8% of our business. In the second quarter, this cohort through mid-single-digit sequentially, by decreased slightly as a percent of total revenue. Customers in these industries are seeing challenges, but continue to invest to build out of web presence in order to remain relevant and competitive. We also disclosed last quarter that we saw customer concessions uptake in March and declined in April. We are pleased to share that second quarter contract modifications came in well below the $2 million headwind we anticipated, with these customer modification requests having printed down during the quarter to historical levels. During the quarter, we were pleased to observe a slight decrease in our sales cycle and remaining within the range we\u2019ve seen historically. In addition, we also saw an uptake in our sales productivity, which improved 7% sequentially. We continue to exceed our new ACV and customer renewal targets. July has trended as planned from a net new ACV and renewals perspective. And despite the current environment, we observed a sequential increase in win rates, which returned to historical ranges. Remaining performance applications, or ARPU ended the quarter $274 million, up 18% quarter-over-quarter and up 58% year-over-year. Also uncertainties remain in the current environment, we are confident in the continued growth of our business and the durability of our subscription model, with variable revenue continuing to be less than 5% of total revenue. Therefore, we are pleased to raise guidance both for the third quarter, as well as for the fiscal year. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $102.5 million to $103.5 million, representing an increase of 39% to 40% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $16 million to $15 million. We expect net loss per share in the range of $0.06 to $0.05 assuming approximately 302 million common shares outstanding, and we expect an effective tax rate of negative 6.2%. For the full year 2020, we expect the revenue in the range of $404 million to $408 million, representing an increase of 41% to 42% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $55 million to $53 million. We expect net loss per share over the period in the range of $0.18 to $0.17, assuming approximately 301 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2020 of negative 8.6%. In closing, we\u2019re optimistic about the continued durability of our business and the efficiency of our platform. We\u2019re thankful for the resiliency of our employees, the strength of our customer relationships and overall productivity in a work-from-home environment, as such, we believe we are well positioned to execute, despite these challenging times. With that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a really strong quarter. And certainly, it\u2019s a tough environment that does now go unnoticed. What really stood out to me is, growth in large customers. I think it was 65% and also Matthew, you talked about record productivity and really strong new hires, some others are pulling back. I guess, given like these trends seem to be accelerating here. Large enterprise expansion, does this typically mean you\u2019re displacing a legacy on-prem vendor? Or rather it\u2019s just greenfield winds to support net new cloud workload?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the kudos. We\u2019ve been really happy with our ability to close larger and larger customers. We\u2019re up to now about 15% of the Fortune 1000 are using Cloudflare that\u2019s up from 13% in Q1. I think we see a number of different places that people come to us. But our belief is there are no new dollars in the world. And so we don\u2019t think of it as a greenfield opportunity, but rather traditionally that we are replacing what is usually a existing on-premise hardware-based solution as part of the digital transformation that enterprises are going through right now, whether they were planning on doing that in 2020 or not.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then, the other thing, obviously it\u2019s been in the news with Workers Unbound. Personally, when we talk to partners and customers alike, we think Workers could be one of just the biggest long-term opportunities you have. And you did give a lot of helpful metrics to think about this opportunity. Could you give a little bit more details about what Unbound actually means for adoption of that service? It strikes me that there\u2019s a number of positives there, and you highlighted some of them, but just maybe a little bit more details on Unbound?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So we\u2019ve had a edge computing offering in the market now for nearly three years. And I think over that period of time, we\u2019ve learned a lot about what developers really want from a computing platform. And I think that when you and I spoke three years ago, I probably have talked about, powering IoT devices and driverless cars and how being faster was really the killer feature for that edge computing product. I think what we\u2019ve learned over the last three years is that actually, when developers think about what they\u2019re doing. One of the terms in Computer Science is that you don\u2019t want to have premature optimization. That\u2019s actually a real mistake. And so fast is great. But if you think of it as sort of the Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of developers needs, fast is like self-actualization. It\u2019s the last thing that you get, not the first. And so what we\u2019re really building with Unbound is something that you have just an edge computing platform, which we think are going to be largely niche application. But instead, think of it as a true serverless application that can provide a number of different functions. And the one that I think is the most interesting and encouraging for us. And we think this is just an enormous opportunity is around something that\u2019s incredibly boring in some respects, which is compliance. As we have more and more countries around the world, requiring data localization and keeping their customers \u2013 keeping their citizens\u2019 data inside the borders of their countries. That\u2019s where you need a network like Cloudflare. And the fact that today, we\u2019re already in more than a 100 countries around the world. And you can, as a developer, write to one platform and be in compliance with those increasingly complicated requirement. I think that\u2019s going to be a really very large opportunity for us. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from the largest customers that are interested in Unbound.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks a lot. Congratulations.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey guys, congrats on the quarter and appreciate the details on Workers there, this quarter Matthew, and the color on the call, Thomas. And our checks heading into the quarter, we were able to have a lot more conversations than normal regarding Cloudflare, who we typically don\u2019t see as much really channelizing, in fact, you guys, you can disclose how much is coming from indirect sources. But can you talk about how your go-to-market is changing and what you\u2019re seeing from more the traditional channel and the integrators out there, including between landing net new customers versus expansion?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that the channel is something where we see a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow and improve. We continue to move up market and we\u2019re working with partners that can help us do that. And I think there are two areas that I\u2019m particularly excited about. One of the things that was difficult about the channel for us in the beginning was we made Cloudflare so easy to sign up for, there wasn\u2019t \u2013 it wasn\u2019t clear what value a reseller could add as a value-added reseller. And so I think that was a trickier place for us. With products like Workers, what we\u2019re increasingly seeing is, channel partners that have real specialties in certain areas, being able to really bring real value and develop IP on our platform, that they can then sell over and over and over again. And so I think it\u2019s still early days of that. But we\u2019re seeing that from large partners like an IBM and other systems traders that are able to deliver that and really seeing value across our platform. I think the second thing is that the class [indiscernible] Teams suite, if you look at other companies that have cloud-based zero trust solution, a lot of them have gone to market through channel partners. And so I think we are taking that and putting that as an extra tool in the bags of those channel partners. And I think that\u2019s going to be an opportunity for us to really build a relationship with those partners, and then hopefully educate them over time to sell the full suite of Cloudflare products.\nJames Fish: And then Matthew, just kind of follow-up. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of political news out there going on. But can you kind of help us frame up, if we shouldn\u2019t expect any impact related to any of the bans that are going on to your business, more related to you guys do have a larger China presence, including a couple of large China relationships, I guess, how are you guys thinking about that for the back half of the year potentially?\nMatthew Prince: So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re following closely and obviously, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball in terms of how those relations developed. On a pure metrics basis, China revenue is low single digits across much less than 5% of total revenue and so that \u2013 even in the worst case scenarios, we don\u2019t see that as a significant change in our business. What I think is more important is that long-term strategy of the United States [Audio Dip] we sell more as U.S. company to the Chinese market. And so we actually think that by being the infrastructure that helps U.S. companies better sell to the Chinese market, we actually think that\u2019s aligned with the long-term interests, actually on both sides of the political \u2013 both sides of the Pacific Ocean are. And so far we haven\u2019t seen anything that makes us \u2013 suspect that we will be face unusual challenges, but even if we do again, this small part of our business.\nJames Fish: That\u2019s make sense. Thanks Matthew. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nDrew Glaeser: Hi, this is Drew on for Sterling. You kind of touched on this a bit, but I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on how the China opportunity is ramping, particularly with the JD Cloud data center additions and what kind of demand you\u2019re seeing in that region?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So we continue to see a demand from Chinese companies or let me state it differently. I think there are two different directions that we\u2019re seeing demand. So one is from Chinese companies, which are trying to sell outside of China and the second is for U.S. companies that want to sell into China. I think the former of those we\u2019ve seen continued strength in \u2013 I think there\u2019s a little bit of uncertainty around the ladder. But again, it\u2019s been a relatively small piece of our business. The JD Cloud partnership is going very well. We expect that that will turn on in the first half of 2021, which is what it was on schedule for. And they have so far been a terrific partner for us, and the same is true of Baidu. They\u2019ve now been a partner for us for over five years. And again, we think that it\u2019s very much aligned and being the infrastructure that can help more companies sell into China. And we think that that\u2019s a very unique opportunity that we can provide to the market.\nDrew Glaeser: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Congrats on another great quarter. I actually just have two of them. First, one of the things you\u2019ve talked about is how customers benefit from the new products without changing their infrastructure. It just because of the way that your network is built, what do you think about, I guess the tipping point, especially sort of in a COVID world of having sort of multiple functions from Cloudflare? Are you starting to see adoption of more functions because of COVID world, how are you thinking about that tipping point? And then just have one follow-up to that?\nMatthew Prince: I think our strategy from the beginning has been, how can we get customers onto our network? How can we get traffic flowing through our network? Learn from what that is, and then help migrate customers to use more and more of our platform. And so I think we are seeing that in two directions. One is we are technically able to recommend other products to customers. So very consistent play that we\u2019re running right now is, we may be helping somebody with their basic firewall application. But we see that they are experiencing a lot of automated bot traffic. We can do analysis on that bot traffic and then recommend that as an additional solution to them. And so that is helping us expand across those customers. The second part is much less technical, but just simply that we\u2019ve really built trust as a provider that offers an enormous and very compelling return on the investment that they\u2019ve made. And so that allows us with that trust to go back to them get introductions inside of the organization, let our sales team move laterally and build much long-term and dynamic relationship driven sales. And so we\u2019re \u2013 we really think that the secret of Cloudflare is that one plus one equals three. And I think that what you\u2019re seeing in the market and what you\u2019re seeing from our customers is that we\u2019re seeing that same pattern happened over and over again. One thing, that\u2019s been really interesting has been how quickly that\u2019s happening. And I think a little bit of that might be coming due to COVID, where we are oftentimes now having a customer land with one product. And then as Thomas said, sometimes just the very next quarter expand with an additional product. And so we\u2019re seeing really strong adoption and really strong expansion that doesn\u2019t necessarily always happen over multiple years though. And so I think that that\u2019s in some ways, why we actually internally, see a much, much stronger expansion that you might see in something like that dollar-based net retention specific.\nPhil Winslow: Got it. Great. And then just a real one follow-up, obviously, nobody loves Workers more than us. But I want to talk about to your other new products, a Magic Transit and Teams. For Teams, why don\u2019t you give us a sense of just how many customers or just users, you\u2019re up to now with Teams? And then also Magic Transit, just sort of any update there on the progress?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So with Teams, we have disclosed exactly how many customers we have on the platform that\u2019s sold on a seats base. But we have been, as we said in the last call, we\u2019ve been really heartened by how many people we\u2019ve been able to help during COVID. And we had over 2,000 companies sign up for our promotion that gave that product away through September of this year. And so we\u2019ve been now reaching out to those customers and have been very encouraged by those early conversations of converting what have been on that pre-COVID plan into paying customers. And we think that Teams is one of the products that we\u2019re most excited about and will be a meaningful driver of revenue, especially in 2021. For Magic Transit, it really is one of those super products that\u2019s taken off. And one of the announcements that we had earlier this week is that you can now directly interconnect your network directly into, into ours. And so I think watch that space we\u2019re getting larger and larger wins, and that is more deeply integrating us into the infrastructure of our customers, which we think makes Cloudflare, a very sticky product and allows us to provide more solutions to our customers over the long term.\nPhil Winslow: Great. All right. Thanks guys. Keep up with the good work.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham.\nAlex Henderson: Thank you very much. So I wanted to step back from the granularity of the quarter, a little bit to what I think is probably the key longer term picture. It seems pretty clear to me that with the billion applications growing at a 40% plus clip. And with Kubernetes orchestration going from 15% of new applications being deployed to over 50 in the next three years that you guys really are the best connected tissue between those applications to other applications domain to domain and from applications to users? So in that context, how do you view this broader picture, as Kubernetes adoption accelerates?\nMatthew Prince: So internally we\u2019re a big Kubernetes fan and a user of ourselves. What I will say is that, what we\u2019re hearing from developers is that even Kubernetes is really step on sort of the journey towards developer nirvana, which is, can you get rid of having a TechOps team entirely? Can you stop having to think about the underlying infrastructure? Can you just write code and it automatically will scale up or scale down to what you are delivering. And that\u2019s really the magic of what we have built with Workers, and that\u2019s really the promise of a serverless platform. And so I think you\u2019re exactly right, that the fact that Cloudflare is best connected tissue as the network puts us in a very strategic relationship. But we actually think that the world beyond VM, the world beyond containers, the world beyond that kind of orchestration platform is something where an individual developer could on their own build a billion dollar company without ever having to have a TechOps team. And I think that that\u2019s really the promise that products like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, that is Zero function are targeting. And what we\u2019re proud of is that Workers is taking those workloads and being able to deliver that to developers in a way that is faster, more consistent, more cost effective, easier to use. And over time, I think is going to be a much more compliance friendly platform, especially as the internet development ecosystem gets more and more complicated over time.\nAlex Henderson: So going to the second part of the question. You\u2019re directly heading in the direction I was going, which is to the extent that workers enabled serverless and drives probably the most efficient platform for coders to move to. Can you talk a little bit about why yours is better than the competition\u2019s in terms of the way your platform is designed particularly with isolates and the 0 cold starts and why that is so differentiated versus the competition? Because it\u2019s a critical point that you guys not only have the most open platform for the way you\u2019re writing it. You\u2019re not just doing, say in one language like varnish, but rather doing all the programming languages of the customers, i.e., the coders want. And at the same time, a platform that delivers exceptional security and very fast performance on the edge.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. When I was a network administrator back in the early 90\u2019s at my college, when we wanted to turn up a new application, we had to actually physically buy a new server. And at the time we actually bought servers from Gateway, and I thought the cow covered boxes were fun. And the time to turn up a new application, so took a lot of time. And then along came VMware and virtual machine. And what that allowed was multiple different applications to run on a single machine. And that gave rise to the very first cloud providers that were out there. But even virtual machines had a lot of overhead as they ran. So that\u2019s where you had companies like dotCloud, which became Docker and the real revolution in containers, which were a lighter weight version of a virtual machine. The goal here is always to make sure that you can run code in a secure, safe multitenant environment and containers will be slightly lighter weight version. And that\u2019s what most of the serverless platforms out there today are building on top of, are those containers. And the downside of that is, those containers \u2013 when you have to scale up, it takes a lot of time. So for example, with something like AWS Lambda it will automatically spin up another machine with another container when there\u2019s low that demands it. But the problem is that it can take hundreds of milliseconds to up to seconds for that application to be ready. And that inconsistency is a really bad experience for users, which is really the knock on a lot of the serverless platforms that are out there today. What we realized was that in order to make workers as powerful as we wanted it to be, we needed to make it a platform that was even more efficient than what you could get with containers. And that\u2019s why we moved to a technology called isolates. And so isolates, they\u2019re just the next generation, and it gives us some real advantages. It means, that we can have literally \u2013 we announced last week, zero microseconds \u2013 zero nanoseconds, cold start time. So it is ready, the minute you want to run it, it means we can support a wide variety of different languages. We don\u2019t require developers to have to learn our language. We want to go to them and not have them come to us. And I think one of the really important things is that data efficiency has actually allowed us to price the product in a way, which is incredibly competitive, again, as much as 75%, less expensive than AWS Lambda for the exact same workloads. And that means that \u2013 and we can do that is because we just have that much less overhead. So we think that this is the next step and the next generation in the same way that VMs were a revolution from bare metal and containers were evolution from VM. We think containers are \u2013 excuse me, that isolates are the next step. And that\u2019s what powers workers, and that\u2019s how we can be as efficient and flexible as we\u2019ve been able to be become.\nAlex Henderson: So if I just follow just one last point on that. So as I\u2019m pulling microservices out consistently and constantly those cold starts are very frequent. So that would mean that, it has to happen that way in order to have the CICB pipeline work in that environment, right? Is that the right conclusion?\nMatthew Prince: I think that\u2019s right. And I think that actually, as you distribute, we think that the distributed nature of building this into the network is good because it makes it faster by reducing network latency. But if we hadn\u2019t been able to reduce cold starts down that far, then we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 then you have more \u2013 the load is spread across more machines, which makes that a worse and worse problem. So by solving that I think it will be overcome one of the biggest limitations of an edge computing platform. And again, this isn\u2019t a beta, this isn\u2019t vaporware, this isn\u2019t something, this is something that \u2013 last quarter 22,000 developers wrote their first worker\u2019s application on. And it\u2019s just been really amazing to watch it develop in the market over the last three years.\nJayson Noland: Thanks. Alex. Operator, can we move on to the next analyst, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Just back in the enterprise momentum. I\u2019m just curious you could give us your view in the back half of the year and how that pipeline shaping up? And Matthew, what are you hearing kind of the biggest constraint right now for you to open up the enterprise even more than you have today? What key things do you need to pass through to really make this move quick? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I\u2019m going to let \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the second half of the question and I\u2019ll let Thomas talk through a little bit of what we\u2019re seeing in terms of backlog. So, I think that our strategy, when we launched from the beginning was to start at the low end and move up over time. And I think we\u2019ve done that incredibly well with well over 600 now customers that are paying us over $100,000 a year, 16% of the Fortune 1000. And taking off a lot of the requirement that those larger, more sophisticated customers are requiring in terms of compliance and other features that a more sophisticated customer has. So I really think that we have proven that we can land those largest of the large customers. We\u2019re building the case studies around that. And I think that you\u2019ll see more and more of the largest enterprises in the world adopting Cloudflare. They may start on just one of our products, but again, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that once we have someone using any part of our platform, we can expand that over time. Thomas, do you want to talk about backlog?\nThomas Seifert: So we we\u2019ve seen really strong performance from a new ACV generation perspective. The sales team has done an outstanding job. And because of that, our backlog for RPO would\u2019ve gone up 18% quarter-over-quarter, 58% year-over-year. And that means from a guidance perspective, 75% of the third quarter is already rolling off the balance sheet. We also think that the strong momentum we\u2019ve seen on large expansion deals, I mentioned in my script that nine out of the large 10 large deals where expansion deals with existing customers. If we look at our pipeline, we think that trend is also going to continue for the second half of 2020.\nBrent Thill: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on my end as well with respect to the quarterly performance and guidance. A question for Thomas and it might be correlated, I\u2019m building on the prior question. I\u2019m trying to get a sense with respect to guidance, just directionally. Clearly last quarter, it was what appeared to be playing more defense on all fronts, pandemic just kicked off and kept your guidance in tack mostly. But this quarter we are getting a beep in the race. Those of us working with you historically in prior positions, we call your thoughtfulness on guidance, maybe to say conservative level. Just trying to gauge and understanding, and maybe some sort of compare contrast on guidance this quarter versus the prior. And I have a follow-up.\nThomas Seifert: Yes. Thanks for the question. We wouldn\u2019t call it conservative. We would call it prudent. And you\u2019re right. Guidance last quarter was \u2013 there was a lot more uncertainty out there and we were very open communicating that, we wanted to keep the hands on the steering wheel as most of you called it, making sure that we show that getting control of the our business, we think we were. And the guidance was about protecting the downsides of us leaning in and reiterating guidance for the year. For this quarter, we have a lot more data points. So we finished our second quarter that is already strong. We have put insight into old pipeline. We have good visibility of what is going to roll off from a balance sheet perspective. So there\u2019s less uncertainty from what we can control. We\u2019ve seen significantly less headwinds from a concession and from a bad debt perspective. And so that allowed us to maybe lean in a bit more. But still despite all that, there\u2019s still a huge amount of uncertainty out there. So we updated our models and we ran our simulations. And I would call it, still prudent, but in light of a lot more data points we have, and a lot more visibility we have what our pipeline and customer momentum looks like for the second half.\nShaul Eyal: That is fair enough. That\u2019s fair enough. And a tricky one. I don\u2019t know whether Thomas, you want to take it, maybe Matthew? It was also \u2013 I think it was asked maybe by Phil, but I want to find and approach it a little differently. So the VPN access the team product currently given free as a public service to new users until September 1. Have you run some sort of a back of the envelope analysis? What\u2019s the potential revenue you could have been generating? It doesn\u2019t have to be quantitative or any qualitative commentary, maybe some color on that will be highly appreciated. Thank you for that.\nThomas Seifert: Let me have a run at it first, and then Matthew Prince can jump in. It\u2019s not like we have no paying customers on the team product, Matthew in his script mentioned that one of the oldest financial institutions in Europe that signed up for Cloudflare access. And of course, that is a paying customer. When we talk about three little customers that we signed up, when we opened it up there at the beginning of the crisis. And we\u2019ve looked at conversion scenarios. It\u2019s fair to say that little of that \u2013 almost none of that, what is today free, is reflected in our guidance for the year, because we want to be really considerate about how we approach that. The crisis is not done. There are a lot of customers that are still struggling and depend on us being a good business partner. So I think we will have a lot more to talk to you about when we come to our next earnings call. So in terms of forecast, very little of this conversion is reflected in the forecast today.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. We\u2019re going to optimize for doing right by our customers and for the long-term. And so, again, I think we\u2019re trying to be very prudent in terms of forecasting anything for those customers right now.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you.\nJayson Noland: Operator, can we take questions from one more analyst, please?\nOperator: Yes. Your next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair.\nJames Breen: Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple [Audio Gap]\nThomas Seifert: I\u2019m sorry, you are breaking up. I think we can jump to the next question in line.\nJayson Noland: Operator, can we take questions from one more analyst, please?\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.\nJoe Goodwin: This is Joe Goodwin on for Pat. Thank you so much for taking our question. Can you give us an update on the size of the enterprise salesforce? I believe it was around 25 or 30 perhaps not too long ago. And then just on the enterprise opportunity, what are some of the key changes you were seeing in the conversations that you\u2019re having with customers and prospects?\nThomas Seifert: Let me take the first part and then Matthew is going to jump in answering the second part. Again, we are not going to give a lot of color and specific numbers, so that is developing. But you heard in the script and you have heard talking about it from a hiring perspective. This was a very strong quarter for us in the sales side, especially also from a quota carrying rep perspective. So we are really happy with the progress we are making at building out the team and letting it scale from the headcount and from an expense perspective behind the demand curve we see. I think that was one of the unique things about our business model is that you don\u2019t have to invest ahead of demand, but our ramp up follow with customers from a size perspective and from a geographic perspective, and we are making good progress. But we are staying true to a model, keeping our go-to-market decision and our customer acquisition cost in line.\nMatthew Prince: And I think from a conversation with customers\u2019 perspective, I think that the thing that has been the most surprising I think to us. And it\u2019s driven, I think a little by COVID has been that customers that traditionally have been slow to adopt the cloud from regions of the world like Europe, which has been a little bit more conservative from areas like manufacturing and industrial, which have been a little bit slower traditionally, that we are hearing more and more of them say, okay, we get it. We really have to do this and we can\u2019t wait any longer. And so I think that\u2019s been the very positive thing that we\u2019re hearing and that they really are starting to understand that Cloudflare is the next-generation network that can solve a lot of the problems that they used to have to buy boxes for. And that makes sense as part of and a large part of their overall digital transformation strategy.\nJoe Goodwin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to the speakers for any closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: Just wanted to say thank you to our entire team Cloudflare. It\u2019s been amazing to watch everyone adapt to over the last five months, a remote working environment. I\u2019m really proud of how productive everyone has remained. Thanks to everyone as a shareholder. We\u2019re going to keep going forward. And Michelle likes to say, we\u2019re just getting started. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Matthew. And thanks again to everyone for joining us. As Matt mentioned, we continued the momentum from our first quarter. So less headwinds from the COVID pandemic than previously anticipated and deliver another outstanding quarter with strengths in multiple areas of the business. Total revenue for the second quarter grew 48% year-over-year to $99.7 million. The growth in revenue was driven by another quarter of strong customer demand, both in terms of new logo acquisition, as well as expansion within our existing customer base. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 49% of revenue and increased 46% year-over-year. Our international business represented 51% of revenue and increased 50% year-over-year. International growth was driven primarily by EMEA, which saw record year-over-year growth of 62% helped by new product adoption from large enterprises. Turning to our customer metrics, we exited the quarter with more than 3 million total free and paying customers, representing an increase of 40% year-over-year. As a reminder, beginning last quarter, we shifted to revenue-based KPIs and away from billings as the basis for all KPIs. We added the record number of large and paying customers in the second quarter on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. We added approximately 7,000 paying customers in the second quarter, bringing the total number of paying customers to over 96,000. We added more than 80 large customers sequentially ending the quarter with 637 paying customers, which was greater than $100,000 in annualized revenue, which is up 65% year-over-year, roughly, half of the 637 large customers, testing on the platform for more than a year and the other half for less than one-year. For second quarter, dollar-based net retention was 115%, which decrease 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by non-strategic accounts in Asia Pacific that turned off our platform. Outside of the Asia Pacific region, overall expansion in the quarter from large enterprise customers was strong, with nine of our top 10 deals, in terms of newer ACV coming from existing accounts. A meaningful number of large expansion deals came from customers that haven't yet been on the platform for a year, and therefore, have yet to contribute to dollar net retention. We view this as a healthy indication of our ability to expand our new customers quickly and expect this trend to continue into the second half of 2020. Second quarter gross margin was 76.8%, down 150 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points year-over-year, which is in line with the expectations we shared last quarter and our long-term target of 75% to 77%. We have been able to absorb Internet traffic levels 30% to 40% higher than pre-COVID without a significant impact to gross margin. Turning to operating expenses, we remain focused on building a long-term business with a sustainable growth, while improving the operating leverage in our business. Second quarter operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 8% sequentially, and 20% year-over-year to 86%. As Matthew mentioned, we achieved record hiring in the second quarter with a focus on key geographies like Austin and Lisbon increasing our headcount by 44% year-over-year and bringing our total number of employees to 1,535 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $47.4 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 9% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. Sales and marketing, as a percentage of revenue, remained flat at 48% sequentially and decreased 5% year-over-year. To add to what Matthew mentioned, where the record quarter in terms of sales hiring, including quota bearing reps, which is important as we look out to fiscal year 2021. Research and development expenses were $21.3 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 4% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. R&D, as the percentage of revenue, decreased to 21% from 22% last quarter and 27% in the same quarter last year. We've seen excellent progress building out our Lisbon office, which we expect to contribute to long term R&D leverage. G&A expenses were $17.4 million for the quarter, representing a decrease of 21% sequentially and constant year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower than expected bad debt expense and the reduction in events and office expenses. G&A, as the percentage of revenue, was 17%, representing a decrease of 7% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. We continue to see operating leverage in the business as operating margin improved by over 1,800 basis points year-over-year and 600 basis points sequentially. Operating loss was $9.5 million in the second quarter, compared to $18.7 million in the same period last year. We accelerated hiring the second quarter in order to remain on track to achieve full hiring plans and as such expect to see variations in the magnitude of operating leverage going forward. Net lost in the quarter was $9.6 million or net loss per share of $0.03. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was negative 12.2%. We have strong and flexible balance sheet ending the second quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Early in the quarter, we issued a $575 million convertible note offering with total net proceeds of $562 million. In connection with the offering, we bought a capped call with 100% premium in order to protect our common shareholders from dilution. Second quarter free cash flow was negative $20.2 million or 20% of revenue compared to the negative $16.9 million or 25% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was positive $4 million in the second quarter. The improvement was primarily to create profitability and improve working capital help by strong collections. Our DSOs remained well within the historical range, which we view as encouraging against a recessionary environment. We expect to see variability in operating cash flow due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital and the growth in our enterprise business. Before moving to guidance for the third quarter and full year, as I would like to provide an update on the COVID related impacts and associated provisions we shared last quarter. Last quarter, we disclosed that customers' highly affected by COVID-related challenges, particularly those in macro-sensitive industries, such as transportation, hospitality and retail, represented approximately 8% of our business. In the second quarter, this cohort through mid-single-digit sequentially, by decreased slightly as a percent of total revenue. Customers in these industries are seeing challenges, but continue to invest to build out of web presence in order to remain relevant and competitive. We also disclosed last quarter that we saw customer concessions uptake in March and declined in April. We are pleased to share that second quarter contract modifications came in well below the $2 million headwind we anticipated, with these customer modification requests having printed down during the quarter to historical levels. During the quarter, we were pleased to observe a slight decrease in our sales cycle and remaining within the range we've seen historically. In addition, we also saw an uptake in our sales productivity, which improved 7% sequentially. We continue to exceed our new ACV and customer renewal targets. July has trended as planned from a net new ACV and renewals perspective. And despite the current environment, we observed a sequential increase in win rates, which returned to historical ranges. Remaining performance applications, or ARPU ended the quarter $274 million, up 18% quarter-over-quarter and up 58% year-over-year. Also uncertainties remain in the current environment, we are confident in the continued growth of our business and the durability of our subscription model, with variable revenue continuing to be less than 5% of total revenue. Therefore, we are pleased to raise guidance both for the third quarter, as well as for the fiscal year. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $102.5 million to $103.5 million, representing an increase of 39% to 40% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $16 million to $15 million. We expect net loss per share in the range of $0.06 to $0.05 assuming approximately 302 million common shares outstanding, and we expect an effective tax rate of negative 6.2%. For the full year 2020, we expect the revenue in the range of $404 million to $408 million, representing an increase of 41% to 42% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $55 million to $53 million. We expect net loss per share over the period in the range of $0.18 to $0.17, assuming approximately 301 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2020 of negative 8.6%. In closing, we're optimistic about the continued durability of our business and the efficiency of our platform. We're thankful for the resiliency of our employees, the strength of our customer relationships and overall productivity in a work-from-home environment, as such, we believe we are well positioned to execute, despite these challenging times. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. So we we've seen really strong performance from a new ACV generation perspective. The sales team has done an outstanding job. And because of that, our backlog for RPO would've gone up 18% quarter-over-quarter, 58% year-over-year. And that means from a guidance perspective, 75% of the third quarter is already rolling off the balance sheet. We also think that the strong momentum we've seen on large expansion deals, I mentioned in my script that nine out of the large 10 large deals where expansion deals with existing customers. If we look at our pipeline, we think that trend is also going to continue for the second half of 2020. Yes. Thanks for the question. We wouldn't call it conservative. We would call it prudent. And you're right. Guidance last quarter was \u2013 there was a lot more uncertainty out there and we were very open communicating that, we wanted to keep the hands on the steering wheel as most of you called it, making sure that we show that getting control of the our business, we think we were. And the guidance was about protecting the downsides of us leaning in and reiterating guidance for the year. For this quarter, we have a lot more data points.

So there's less uncertainty from what we can control. We've seen significantly less headwinds from a concession and from a bad debt perspective. And so that allowed us to maybe lean in a bit more. But still despite all that, there's still a huge amount of uncertainty out there. So we updated our models and we ran our simulations. And I would call it, still prudent, but in light of a lot more data points we have, and a lot more visibility we have what our pipeline and customer momentum looks like for the second half. Let me have a run at it first, and then Matthew Prince can jump in.

            "content": "Thank you, Jayson. We had a very strong quarter. Our Q2 revenue came in just shy of $100 million, up 48% year-over-year. We saw strength from our customers of all sizes. We grew our large customer accounts, those paying us more than $100,000 annually by 65% year-over-year. We also added nearly 7,000 new paying customers, bringing our total paying customer count to over 90,000. At the same time, we saw strong growth across our existing customer base as they adopted more features of the Cloudflare platform. While we are very happy with our results, our nature is always to be on the lookout for what could go wrong. As I talked about last quarter, we were concerned about concessions and the risk of bad debt caused as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while we are not out of the woods. We see good reasons to be optimistic. COVID-related concession requests peaked in early April and had been tailed off. We came in well below what we forecast for potential downside. Today, much more so than on our last earnings call, we feel, we have clear visibility into the effects of the pandemic on our business that has given us the confidence as Thomas will detail to raise both our Q3 and our annual guidance. That competence comes foundationally from our very predictable and consistent business model. The vast majority of our revenue, more than 95% we've built upfront on a subscription basis that generally gives us good visibility into our future results. Another consequence appears to have been and we saw the peak in customer concession requests earlier than other companies that fill in arrears on a more volatile usage basis. One thing we are seeing increasingly is customers who were surprised by their large usage based bills that other vendors now coming to us for predictable consistent pricing. No one likes to be surprised by a bill. And we believe the consistency of our staff approach is not only more predictable for us, but also builds trust and wins loyal customers over the long-term. While concessions ended up lower than we had forecasted, I'm proud of how our team works to accommodate those of our customers that were struggling due to COVID. These are tough times for many businesses. Great partnerships are often filled during tough times and consistency and predictability are especially valued, but then so much else seems uncertain. The customers I've talked to, they've been thankful that we've been there as a good reliable partner with them through the challenges over the last five months. For our own business, we are relentlessly paranoid. So we've been watching a handful of metrics in order to help understand the impact of these unusual times. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, our sales cycle has kicked up by a few days in Q1 and trended back down in Q2 and remains well under a quarter and at the low end of our historic range. We're worried sales productivity made slow as our team adapted to working remotely. Instead, sales productivity per ramped rep hit a new record high. Deeper into the weeds, we watch our receivable collection period closely. We speculated that as businesses struggled during the pandemic, our collection period may lengthen. We were pleasantly surprised to see our collections period stay stable over the last two quarters. So what's going on? We believe the pandemic force companies distort their vendors into two buckets, nice to have and must have. All indications from the quantitative metrics we're watching as well as the qualitative conversations we're having with customers are that Cloudflare is squarely in the must have bucket. Of course, we are part of the larger global economy and less we forget we're still in the midst of a global pandemic. So lots of risks remain, but we see no indication that we are really uniquely exposed to the effects of the crisis, quite the opposite. For example, for new customers, segments that have traditionally been slow to adopt the cloud are increasingly embracing their digital transformation and turning to us for help. In Q2, we saw particular strength in Europe, industrial companies and small businesses. Those are not the first three segments you think about when you think about cloud adoption. And yet COVID has caused even those segments of customers that traditionally are slow to change to adapt in order to survive. The nimbleness of our go-to-market team and our short sales cycles have allowed us to adjust our playbook and be there for new customers in these segments, as they unexpectedly accelerated their digital and network transformation plans. It also helps the customers need our services more than ever. We talked last earnings call about the incredible increase in consumption of internet services generally. The global growth of internet traffic largely plateaued in Q2 and we believe it will remain largely flat in Q3. What did not plateau were cyber attacks. We've blocked 37% more cyber attacks per day for the same cohort of customers in Q2 than Q1. I think of that metric as our cyber attack equivalent of same-store sales. You include new customers to growth in mitigated attacks with 53%, when companies based online cyber threats, they increasingly turn immediately to Cloudflare. May was the busiest month the internet has ever seen for distributed denial of service attacks. We saw an attack against one of our customers that lasted four days and peaked at more than 750 million packets per second, our network didn't flinch. The targeted customers' infrastructure never slowed down and they weren't even aware until our systems alerted them. Suffice it to say none of us expected 2020 to work out the way it has. I'm thankful for our team and our technologies flexibility and proud of all the customers we've helped ensure have a fast, reliable and secure internet through these challenging times. I swore at the last earnings call, where I literally repeated the word four time, I would never again call anything unprecedented, but here we are. Back in April, I spoke to our team in our Q2 kickoff. I emphasized that great companies use crises to focus on what's most important, but also to invest in the future, while others pull back. Our team rose to that challenge. It's been incredible to see the rate of innovation that has continued and in fact, accelerated, even as we've had to adapt to a new work environment. One place you can measure that investment is in hiring. Unlike many others in the industry, we did not slow down. We hired 257 new team members in Q2, which is a record for us and ahead of our hiring plan. But what's behind those numbers is even more impressive. We had nearly 47,000 applicants up 750% year-over-year. If you do the math, that means we extended offers to less than 0.6% of applicants. We had a 96% offer acceptance rate company-wide and then 99% rate in our sales organization. The talent we're seeing is incredible. My parents were proud when I got into HBS, turns out the odds of getting a job at Cloudflare these days are much harder. When 18 months from now you hear about some incredible new feature or a big customer win know that the investment in the people who made that happen came during this time, when we stepped on the gas, while others were pumping the brakes. Even as we made these investments, we continue to make substantial progress on our path toward profitability. This quarter, we delivered nearly 2000 basis points in operating leverage year-over-year. And even as we saw unprecedented spike in traffic and cyber attacks, our gross margins remain north of 76% and within our long-term target model. But of course, there's no metric more important to judging the health of any business and its ability to win the trust of new customers. To that end, I wanted to walk through a handful of customer stories for the quarter. One of the largest and oldest European financial services firm signed a three-year deal with $450,000 per year for Cloudflare for Teams, our zero trust cloud-based replacing or legacy VPNs and firewalls. They talked to many of the major zero trust five security players, and chose Cloudflare for the capabilities that our current offering, as well as what they described as our future proof roadmap. We believe there will be an opportunity to further expand this customer as our browser isolation technology is rolled out in the second half of this year. A large U.S.-based industrial manufacturer signed a deal with $350,000 per year to adopt Cloudflare's web application firewall solution. They were moving to the cloud as part of their digital transformation, replacing legacy on-premise hardware and saw Cloudflare is a clear winner in cloud security. Having established a trusted relationship with them last quarter, this quarter, we are talking to them about adopting our Cloudflare for team solutions for their 50,000 employees. A leading identity and access management provider signed a two-year deal worth a $0.5 million per year. They've moved workloads away from Amazon Web Services due to better speed and flexibility of our platform. They are part of a general trend, we are seeing from the most security savvy organizations, who tell us they trust publish platform, respect our team, will leave in our ability to continue to innovate and embedding on our technology. A Born In The Cloud gaming platform signed an expansion of their existing Cloudflare contract for an additional $1.8 million annually. This platform, which you have kids at home, they're almost certainly using shows Cloudflare to ensure the best possible experience for all their users worldwide. I've been excited to watch how they use Cloudflare Workers, our serverless computing platform to scale and empower the explosive growth they've seen over the first half of 2020. That's one great example of Cloudflare Workers customer. But I wanted to finish by giving you a picture of how developers generally are adopting our serverless computing platform. Cloudflare Workers launched nearly three years ago. Part of what was powerful about Workers was that it was a true turning complete serverless computing platform that allowed developers to build sophisticated applications and run them edge to edge across our entire network. Today, approximately 10% of traffic going through Cloudflare network is powered by Workers. About 20% of new large customer deals include Workers. And in Q2 alone, 22,000 new developers wrote their first application using Workers up 440% year-over-year. We're not satisfied being just a niche edge computing platform. We want to be the go-to-serverless computing platform for all developers and applications. To that end, last week, we announced a number of new Cloudflare Workers features. We significantly raised CPU limit, allowing customers to build even more sophisticated applications. We released pricing that is up to 75%, less expensive for the same workloads than AWS Lambda, while still being margin accretive for us. And we expanded our tools to support the languages developers already know and love like JavaScript, C, C++, Python, Rust, Scala and even COBOL. While I'm excited to see, as the developers choosing Cloudflare Workers, aren't doing so just because it's the fastest, but also because it's the most consistent, secure, cost-effective computing platform. It's easy for them to use and help solve the thorny global compliance issues, their CIO is increasingly care about, watch this space. As Michelle likes to say, we're just getting started. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas to walk through our financial results for the quarter. Thomas, take it away. Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the kudos. We've been really happy with our ability to close larger and larger customers. We're up to now about 15% of the Fortune 1000 are using Cloudflare that's up from 13% in Q1. I think we see a number of different places that people come to us. But our belief is there are no new dollars in the world. And so we don't think of it as a greenfield opportunity, but rather traditionally that we are replacing what is usually a existing on-premise hardware-based solution as part of the digital transformation that enterprises are going through right now, whether they were planning on doing that in 2020 or not. Yes. So we've had a edge computing offering in the market now for nearly three years. And I think over that period of time, we've learned a lot about what developers really want from a computing platform. And I think that when you and I spoke three years ago, I probably have talked about, powering IoT devices and driverless cars and how being faster was really the killer feature for that edge computing product. I think what we've learned over the last three years is that actually, when developers think about what they're doing. One of the terms in Computer Science is that you don't want to have premature optimization. That's actually a real mistake. And so fast is great. But if you think of it as sort of the Maslow's hierarchy of developers needs, fast is like self-actualization. It's the last thing that you get, not the first. And so what we're really building with Unbound is something that you have just an edge computing platform, which we think are going to be largely niche application. But instead, think of it as a true serverless application that can provide a number of different functions. And the one that I think is the most interesting and encouraging for us. And we think this is just an enormous opportunity is around something that's incredibly boring in some respects, which is compliance. As we have more and more countries around the world, requiring data localization and keeping their customers \u2013 keeping their citizens' data inside the borders of their countries. That's where you need a network like Cloudflare. And the fact that today, we're already in more than a 100 countries around the world. And you can, as a developer, write to one platform and be in compliance with those increasingly complicated requirement. I think that's going to be a really very large opportunity for us. And that's what we're hearing from the largest customers that are interested in Unbound. Yes. I think that the channel is something where we see a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow and improve. We continue to move up market and we're working with partners that can help us do that. And I think there are two areas that I'm particularly excited about. One of the things that was difficult about the channel for us in the beginning was we made Cloudflare so easy to sign up for, there wasn't \u2013 it wasn't clear what value a reseller could add as a value-added reseller. And so I think that was a trickier place for us. With products like Workers, what we're increasingly seeing is, channel partners that have real specialties in certain areas, being able to really bring real value and develop IP on our platform, that they can then sell over and over and over again. And so I think it's still early days of that. But we're seeing that from large partners like an IBM and other systems traders that are able to deliver that and really seeing value across our platform. I think the second thing is that the class [indiscernible] Teams suite, if you look at other companies that have cloud-based zero trust solution, a lot of them have gone to market through channel partners. And so I think we are taking that and putting that as an extra tool in the bags of those channel partners. And I think that's going to be an opportunity for us to really build a relationship with those partners, and then hopefully educate them over time to sell the full suite of Cloudflare products. So that's something that we're following closely and obviously, we don't have a crystal ball in terms of how those relations developed. On a pure metrics basis, China revenue is low single digits across much less than 5% of total revenue and so that \u2013 even in the worst case scenarios, we don't see that as a significant change in our business. What I think is more important is that long-term strategy of the United States [Audio Dip] we sell more as U.S. company to the Chinese market. And so we actually think that by being the infrastructure that helps U.S. companies better sell to the Chinese market, we actually think that's aligned with the long-term interests, actually on both sides of the political \u2013 both sides of the Pacific Ocean are. And so far we haven't seen anything that makes us \u2013 suspect that we will be face unusual challenges, but even if we do again, this small part of our business. Yes. So we continue to see a demand from Chinese companies or let me state it differently. I think there are two different directions that we're seeing demand. So one is from Chinese companies, which are trying to sell outside of China and the second is for U.S. companies that want to sell into China. I think the former of those we've seen continued strength in \u2013 I think there's a little bit of uncertainty around the ladder. But again, it's been a relatively small piece of our business. The JD Cloud partnership is going very well. We expect that that will turn on in the first half of 2021, which is what it was on schedule for. And they have so far been a terrific partner for us, and the same is true of Baidu. They've now been a partner for us for over five years. And again, we think that it's very much aligned and being the infrastructure that can help more companies sell into China. And we think that that's a very unique opportunity that we can provide to the market. I think our strategy from the beginning has been, how can we get customers onto our network? How can we get traffic flowing through our network? Learn from what that is, and then help migrate customers to use more and more of our platform. And so I think we are seeing that in two directions. One is we are technically able to recommend other products to customers. So very consistent play that we're running right now is, we may be helping somebody with their basic firewall application. But we see that they are experiencing a lot of automated bot traffic. We can do analysis on that bot traffic and then recommend that as an additional solution to them. And so that is helping us expand across those customers. The second part is much less technical, but just simply that we've really built trust as a provider that offers an enormous and very compelling return on the investment that they've made. And so that allows us with that trust to go back to them get introductions inside of the organization, let our sales team move laterally and build much long-term and dynamic relationship driven sales. And so we're \u2013 we really think that the secret of Cloudflare is that one plus one equals three. And I think that what you're seeing in the market and what you're seeing from our customers is that we're seeing that same pattern happened over and over again. One thing, that's been really interesting has been how quickly that's happening. And I think a little bit of that might be coming due to COVID, where we are oftentimes now having a customer land with one product. And then as Thomas said, sometimes just the very next quarter expand with an additional product. And so we're seeing really strong adoption and really strong expansion that doesn't necessarily always happen over multiple years though. And so I think that that's in some ways, why we actually internally, see a much, much stronger expansion that you might see in something like that dollar-based net retention specific. Yes. So with Teams, we have disclosed exactly how many customers we have on the platform that's sold on a seats base. But we have been, as we said in the last call, we've been really heartened by how many people we've been able to help during COVID. And we had over 2,000 companies sign up for our promotion that gave that product away through September of this year. And so we've been now reaching out to those customers and have been very encouraged by those early conversations of converting what have been on that pre-COVID plan into paying customers. And we think that Teams is one of the products that we're most excited about and will be a meaningful driver of revenue, especially in 2021. For Magic Transit, it really is one of those super products that's taken off. And one of the announcements that we had earlier this week is that you can now directly interconnect your network directly into, into ours. And so I think watch that space we're getting larger and larger wins, and that is more deeply integrating us into the infrastructure of our customers, which we think makes Cloudflare, a very sticky product and allows us to provide more solutions to our customers over the long term. So internally we're a big Kubernetes fan and a user of ourselves. What I will say is that, what we're hearing from developers is that even Kubernetes is really step on sort of the journey towards developer nirvana, which is, can you get rid of having a TechOps team entirely? Can you stop having to think about the underlying infrastructure? Can you just write code and it automatically will scale up or scale down to what you are delivering. And that's really the magic of what we have built with Workers, and that's really the promise of a serverless platform. And so I think you're exactly right, that the fact that Cloudflare is best connected tissue as the network puts us in a very strategic relationship. But we actually think that the world beyond VM, the world beyond containers, the world beyond that kind of orchestration platform is something where an individual developer could on their own build a billion dollar company without ever having to have a TechOps team. And I think that that's really the promise that products like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, that is Zero function are targeting. And what we're proud of is that Workers is taking those workloads and being able to deliver that to developers in a way that is faster, more consistent, more cost effective, easier to use. And over time, I think is going to be a much more compliance friendly platform, especially as the internet development ecosystem gets more and more complicated over time. Yes. When I was a network administrator back in the early 90's at my college, when we wanted to turn up a new application, we had to actually physically buy a new server. And at the time we actually bought servers from Gateway, and I thought the cow covered boxes were fun. And the time to turn up a new application, so took a lot of time. And then along came VMware and virtual machine. And what that allowed was multiple different applications to run on a single machine. And that gave rise to the very first cloud providers that were out there. But even virtual machines had a lot of overhead as they ran. So that's where you had companies like dotCloud, which became Docker and the real revolution in containers, which were a lighter weight version of a virtual machine. The goal here is always to make sure that you can run code in a secure, safe multitenant environment and containers will be slightly lighter weight version. And that's what most of the serverless platforms out there today are building on top of, are those containers. And the downside of that is, those containers \u2013 when you have to scale up, it takes a lot of time. So for example, with something like AWS Lambda it will automatically spin up another machine with another container when there's low that demands it. But the problem is that it can take hundreds of milliseconds to up to seconds for that application to be ready. And that inconsistency is a really bad experience for users, which is really the knock on a lot of the serverless platforms that are out there today. What we realized was that in order to make workers as powerful as we wanted it to be, we needed to make it a platform that was even more efficient than what you could get with containers. And that's why we moved to a technology called isolates. And so isolates, they're just the next generation, and it gives us some real advantages. It means, that we can have literally \u2013 we announced last week, zero microseconds \u2013 zero nanoseconds, cold start time. So it is ready, the minute you want to run it, it means we can support a wide variety of different languages. We don't require developers to have to learn our language. We want to go to them and not have them come to us. And I think one of the really important things is that data efficiency has actually allowed us to price the product in a way, which is incredibly competitive, again, as much as 75%, less expensive than AWS Lambda for the exact same workloads. And that means that \u2013 and we can do that is because we just have that much less overhead. So we think that this is the next step and the next generation in the same way that VMs were a revolution from bare metal and containers were evolution from VM. We think containers are \u2013 excuse me, that isolates are the next step. And that's what powers workers, and that's how we can be as efficient and flexible as we've been able to be become. I think that's right. And I think that actually, as you distribute, we think that the distributed nature of building this into the network is good because it makes it faster by reducing network latency. But if we hadn't been able to reduce cold starts down that far, then we wouldn't \u2013 then you have more \u2013 the load is spread across more machines, which makes that a worse and worse problem. So by solving that I think it will be overcome one of the biggest limitations of an edge computing platform. And again, this isn't a beta, this isn't vaporware, this isn't something, this is something that \u2013 last quarter 22,000 developers wrote their first worker's application on. And it's just been really amazing to watch it develop in the market over the last three years. Yes. I'm going to let \u2013 I'll answer the second half of the question and I'll let Thomas talk through a little bit of what we're seeing in terms of backlog. So, I think that our strategy, when we launched from the beginning was to start at the low end and move up over time. And I think we've done that incredibly well with well over 600 now customers that are paying us over $100,000 a year, 16% of the Fortune 1000. And taking off a lot of the requirement that those larger, more sophisticated customers are requiring in terms of compliance and other features that a more sophisticated customer has. So I really think that we have proven that we can land those largest of the large customers. We're building the case studies around that. And I think that you'll see more and more of the largest enterprises in the world adopting Cloudflare. They may start on just one of our products, but again, I think we've demonstrated that once we have someone using any part of our platform, we can expand that over time. Thomas, do you want to talk about backlog? Yes. We're going to optimize for doing right by our customers and for the long-term. And so, again, I think we're trying to be very prudent in terms of forecasting anything for those customers right now. And I think from a conversation with customers' perspective, I think that the thing that has been the most surprising I think to us. And it's driven, I think a little by COVID has been that customers that traditionally have been slow to adopt the cloud from regions of the world like Europe, which has been a little bit more conservative from areas like manufacturing and industrial, which have been a little bit slower traditionally, that we are hearing more and more of them say, okay, we get it. We really have to do this and we can't wait any longer. And so I think that's been the very positive thing that we're hearing and that they really are starting to understand that Cloudflare is the next-generation network that can solve a lot of the problems that they used to have to buy boxes for. And that makes sense as part of and a large part of their overall digital transformation strategy. Just wanted to say thank you to our entire team Cloudflare. It's been amazing to watch everyone adapt to over the last five months, a remote working environment. I'm really proud of how productive everyone has remained. Thanks to everyone as a shareholder. We're going to keep going forward. And Michelle likes to say, we're just getting started. Thank you."

We would also like to inform you that we will be virtually participating in the J.P. Morgan Global Tech Media and Communications Conference on May 12th, through the 14th, and the Baird Consumer Tech and Services Conference on June 2nd through the 4th. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jason. Let me start by saying what feels almost awkward to say given the circumstances. We had a very strong quarter. Our Q1 revenue finished at $91 million, up 48% year on year, we posted a gross margin of 78%, showing the continued efficiency of our platform. We made substantial progress on our path toward profitability, realizing over 1,000 basis points of operating leverage improvement year on year. That's the easy part. As I said in our first earnings call as a public company, we've been practicing mock earnings calls for years to the point that they already feel like business as usual. However, as I sat down to write up these remarks, I have to confess I struggled because what we're all living through is definitely not businesses as usual, so in many ways this isn't going to be a usual earnings call, settle in, buckle up. I wanted to take a bit more time to walk through four areas I've been focused on, our team, our platform, our business and our customers. And in particular I wanted to give you more of a sense of what we're seeing not just in the last quarter but focusing on March and April as the world reacted to COVID-19, first, our team. We\u2019re very fortunate that the first customer of all of Cloudflare's products is cloud by ourselves. We are digital natives and we're able to use our products like Cloudflare for teams to transition to productive and secure remote work. Our network operation center, security operation center and technical support center all continued to be fully, securely and reliably staffed 24/7, but it's not just about technology it's also an inspiring mission that empowers the team. Cloudflare's player's mission is to help build a better internet, I've just been banking or agricultural crisis who would likely have felt as powerless as many of our friends and colleagues at other companies do right now, but this was a crisis that caused us all worldwide to lean on the internet more than ever before. Undoubtedly, the superheroes of this crisis are the medical professionals and scientists taking care of the sick and searching for a cure to this disease, but the fateful sidekick, the Ant-Man's to Captain Marvel has been the internet, and as one of the guardians of the internet, I'm proud of how our team has risen to the occasion to support our customers new and old, as they deal with unprecedented challenges. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all our teams. You are working incredibly hard to ensure the internet continues to function while the world has needed it more than ever before. I'm proud of how well you've all kept up our level of productivity and excellence, and most importantly honored to see you support each other, as well as our millions of customers as we live through these challenging times together. Companies are really just collections of people and this crisis has reaffirmed to me. We have a great team. Second our platform, we growth in internet traffic has been unprecedented, across our platform. We saw as much growth in traffic in 12 weeks as we have seen in the previous 12 months. The flexibility of our platform for every server in every city can run every Cloudflare service has allowed us to continue to spread, load and serve all our customers. Stress does make systems better and our engineering team has used this time as a way to make our platform more efficient. For instance, our firewall team released a series of improvements that shaved 40% of the processing time on every request. That means we are doing full deep packet inspection and threat analysis in a fraction of a millisecond at our tremendous scale. It also means that our network has actually gotten faster during this crisis while at the same time acquiring less hardware. We expect these and many more innovations will pay dividends for years to come. One of the concerns we had early in the crisis was our supply chain, Cloudflare's sources, the hardware that powers our network through multiple ODM partners. These partners as well as the many component manufacturers they rely on for parts are largely based in Asia where the virus first hit. Beginning of early January in light of the app, the time unnamed virus, our infrastructure team thoroughly analyzed our supply chain identifying potential bottlenecks. We moved up some purchases of key components we thought may become constrained this proof pressure. Thus far, we've been able to continue to receive the equipment we needed without meaningful delay in order to expand our network during this time of unprecedented demand, and the demand has been unprecedented. We've seen internet traffic use nearly doubled through March and April versus the beginning of the year. Both global traffic has still increasing regionally, we are seeing network traffic plateau. Different categories of traffic have grown more than others. Demand for educational and kids content, arts and crafts and parenting content have all more than doubled. On the other hand, traffic to sites about sports scores travel and real estate has declined. The scalability and flexibility of our unified platform with its ability to serve our diverse customer base and distribute load globally has served us very well. Third, our business, I've given you the Q1 highlights, but let me zoom into March and April and give you more granularity in what we're seeing. Beginning in March, we saw a modest uptick in the length of our average sales cycle. That added a few days to our closing deals. However, our average sales cycle still remains well under a quarter and even with the modest uptick is shorter than it was just 12 months ago. Our sales in March were strong, finishing ahead of our plan. What was surprising to us was how much of marches business closed in the last week of the quarter. Our ability to close new business has continued without a break through April and to-date, we are tracking well to our plan for new business this quarter. Our read is that much of the world took a bit of a pause for a few weeks in mid March, well, companies figured out their remote procurement processes. But once those were figured out, deals for critical services like those cloud provides, our customers got done. One more view into what the data are showing us. We track our sales pipeline closely. While many things may still impact win rates, we are encouraged that we added more new pipeline in February than in January, more in March than in February, and more in April than in March. I'm proud of our team and while the demand is there, we have no intention of slowing down. Part of the key to our success comes back to our short sales cycle and our ability to sell services without sending accounts or professional service team on-premise. Businesses large and small have an acute need for a fast, reliable, secure network. Now more than ever, they come to us every hour of every day. And we can have them up and running as quickly as a few hours a minute compared to our competitors, weeks or months. And because of our short sales cycle, we can adapt quickly. As we came to understand that certain industries were going to be particularly impacted by the current crisis, we shifted our sales resources to thriving verticals, so our teams could still make their quarter. One surprise for the quarter was our pay as you go business. This segment is for customers who sign up with a credit card on month to month agreements and without talking to anyone on our sales team. Today, it's a small portion of our revenue, but it's our roots where we started over nine years ago. And so it's still very important. We were concerned this segment may be more impacted because of its exposure to small businesses and individual developers. To our surprise, last quarter, it had its strongest year-over-year growth in years. And it's continued to show strong growth in April. That won't make a big difference to our bottom line because it's a relatively small portion of our overall revenue. But I'm proud we're still there to serve the small businesses, startups and individual developers who need a service like Cloudflare now more than ever, businesses of all sizes and shapes are moving online to survive, and we are helping them. That's the good news, but it's not all rosy, we are seeing an uptick in requests for concessions. Thomas will give you more details, but I wanted to tell you how we're thinking about those requests. Based on our analysis of the customer base, and the industries that are most impacted, we believe the vast majority of our customers will get through this. Some however, may need short term help. We're using the strength of our balance sheet to help these customers in their time of need, build goodwill, and at the same time, working out beneficial terms to deepen our relationship over the long term. We are fortunate that because of the breadth of our product offerings delivered across our unified platform, we're often able to cost effectively bundle services together and help our customers replace legacy vendors, especially now, helping customers save money and simplify their operation leads to a particularly compelling ROI. Our competition with their narrower set of offerings does not have this luxury. Well, some hardware vendors may have had a temporary bump this quarter as CIOs scrambled to make sure they had enough firewall or VPN capacity, we believe that is short lived. Those same CIOs are emailing and me saying, we never want to go through something like this again. There's a cartoon circulating that asks, who led the digital transformation at your company, CEO, CTO for COVID-19. History may well record this crisis, as the last gasp for on premise network hardware. Similarly, there are a number of cloud providers that only offer limited point solutions. Our platform strategy has positioned us well for this current moment, and we are aggressively leveraging it to take market share. We're seeing a number of new prospects engage in conversations about to find ways of saving money by leveraging our robots more cost effective platform. To that end, as we said before, we will continue to use our gross margin as a weapon to gain share. As an example of that, in March we made the call to make Cloudflare for teams, which we just launched in January free for any business until September 1st. Cloudflare for teams solve an acute need as companies shifted to 100% remote work, and their existing firewall and VPN hardware solutions couldn't keep up. In the last few months, we've on boarded over 1,000 companies onto Cloudflare for teams. Since we made it free, right now they're all costs and no revenue. But we're proud of being there for businesses in their time of need. And what we've learned in the last nine years of running Cloudflare is that once you're part of some infrastructure, even apparently don't trust and that builds opportunity. In other words, we feel very fortunate with our results in the short term, we remain relentlessly focused on the long term. However, make no mistake. There will be headwinds in the short term. We are part of the broader economy and as businesses struggle and go out of business we will lose some customers. But long term, we believe we are well positioned to be one of the few networks that will help run a large portion of the internet. So, lastly, I wanted to talk about some of our customer wins for the quarter. We had some incredible wins like a credit reporting service and signed a three year deal worth $800,000 per year, a major gaming platform with a deal worth over a million dollars per year, a reinsurance provider who will pay us $750,000 over three years to protect their network and a U.S. government agency using a broad set of our platforms features to secure nuclear research for over $150,000 per year. So, let me focus on some customers that are uniquely relevant to this moment. One of the largest telemedicine providers in the United States turned to Cloudflare as the crisis set in they had to shift the majority of their physicians from clinics where they have legacy on premise security hardware to their homes where obviously they did not. As a highly regulated industry, security of patient information is critical, they on-boarded their positions onto clapper for teams, so they could keep serving patients. Here's what their CIO said about the experience, ''I wish we had done this years ago after seeing how easy it was. Beautiful. This is perfect. I mean on so many levels. I love that''. Accompanying many of us are relying on just deliver food to our Homes while we shelter-in-place, signed a deal for over $600,000 per year in January. In March their demand was up so much they increased their deal by more than $500,000 per year. One of their goals was to ensure that, they could decrease their dependency on Amazon web services. They found Cloudflare was not only faster and more robust, but also significantly more cost effective and they're using Cloudflare Workers, our edge computing platform to solve a handful of development challenges they couldn't through any other platform. Beyond the customers who paid us, we're also proud of the customers doing critical work we could support through our project Galileo initiative. Last quarter, we helped to ensure fast, reliable, secure access for projects like covidenearyou.org a project created by Harvard Epidemiologists and software developers to track COVID-19 hotspots, maskaherony.com, which facilitated the donation of more than 27,000 masks, the medical professionals in New York City, theamerican.org, which is providing emotional support, resources and suicide prevention for the millions of lonely people impacted by this crisis, beatcovid19now.org develop high esteem of Australian public health and IT researchers to track and make sense of COVID-19 symptoms and many, many, many more. It is inspiring to our whole team that we are able to lend our technology and expertise to help the true superheroes behind these organizations. Finally, this is a hard time, no doubt, and there will be headwinds even for a business like ours, but it's also replete with opportunity. My message to our team has been clear. Iconic companies are born out of crisis. They take these opportunities to do two things, focus and invest. So, we are focusing on the products and innovation that leads to the highest returns, and we are investing in building trust, hiring the greatest people and establishing ourselves for the long-term. There are a small number of companies that will power the future of the Internet. We feel very fortunate, very privileged and very lucky to be one of the Internet's guardians during this crisis. And I'm confident that, will serve us well as we strive to build an iconic company over the long-term. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you Matt and thanks again to everyone for joining us. We continued the momentum from 2019 and delivered a strong first quarter, exceeding the high-end of our revenue guidance. We believe this reflects our critical role in helping customers transform and digitize their business models. Today, I plan to review our first quarter results, discuss the impact of COVID-19, provide guidance for the second quarter and update guidance for the full year of 2020. Turning to our results, total revenue for the first quarter grew 48% year-over-year to $91.3 million. The growth in revenue was driven by strong customer demand, both in terms of new logo acquisition as well as expansion within our existing customer base. As Matthew mentioned, we saw significant strengths with our pay-as-you-go business. Our pay-as-you-go customers are not committed to a contract, but rather are on a month-to-month subscription plan and predominantly composed of small and medium sized businesses. We believe the strength of this cohort during a global pandemic speaks to the value of Cloudflare network in the durability of our business model. To provide some additional transparency our pay-as-you-go customers represent the strong majority of our paying customer base. Our contract customers represent a strong majority of our revenue. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 40% of revenue, and increased 44% year-over-year. Our international business represented 62% of revenue and increased 62% year-over-year. International growth was driven primarily by Europe, which increased 58% year-over-year. We started making incremental sales investments in Europe last year to hide the traction in our pay-as-you-go business. We are pleased to see those investments start to take hold specific events from Germany and the UK. As a reminder, beginning this quarter, we shifted to revenue based KPIs and the way from billings as the basis for our KPIs. We believe this move to revenue based KPIs better aligns with our peer group of publicly disclosed financials and our business model as we continue to scale. We provided eight quarters of revenue based historical so comparison purposes, which can be referenced in this quarter supplemental financial information document on our Investor Relations website. We added approximately 250,000 total customers during the quarter to exit the quarter at roughly $2.8 million total free and paying customers representing an increase of 40% year-over-year. We also added over 5,000 paying customers in the first quarter, bringing the total number of paying customers to over 89,000. We remain focused on expansion within existing customers and growing our large enterprise customer base, and then just the quarter with 536 paying customers with greater than $100,000 in annualize revenue, which is up 65% year-over-year. Our first quarter dollar base net retention rate was 117%, which decreased 2% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The slight decline was largely driven by higher term in the Asia Pacific region. Dollar base net retention measures our ability to retain and expand revenue from existing customers in the prior year period. Our measurement this net of contraction net of churn and excludes the benefit of free customers that upgrades to take subscription. First quarter gross margin was 78.3%, down 48 basis points sequentially and up 150 basis points year-over-year. Network efficiency continues to be a defining strength of all business models, allowing us to absorb significantly higher rates of traffic and offer a critical solution like Cloudflare for Teams to new customers at no charge for September 1st. As we said previously, we'll use our gross margin advantage as a strategic weapon when opportunities present themselves. During this crisis, we are focused on doing the right thing for our customers to be and follow business in the long-term. Therefore, in second quarter, we expect to see gross margin closer to our long-term targets of 75% to 77%. Turning for our operating expenses, we remain focused on improving the leverage and our business while balancing investments for growth. Total operating expenses were $85.9 million for the first quarter up 2% sequentially, and 35% year over year, while we increase our headcount by 43% year over year, bringing our total number of employees to 1368 at the end of the quarter, we saw delay in hiring and on-boarding, which we expect to catch up in the current quarter. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 6% sequentially and 9% year over year to 94%. Sales and marketing expenses were $43.4 million for the quarter, representing a decrease of 1% sequentially and an increase of 42% year over year. The sequential decrease was largely due to swift production and travel, discretionary marketing spend in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, decrease the 48% from 49% in the first quarter last year, and from 52% last quarter. Research and development expenses for $20.5 million in the quarter, representing a decrease of 7% sequentially and an increase of 19% year over year. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 24% from 28% in Q1 last year, and from 26% last quarter. General and administrative expenses were $22 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 18% sequentially and 40% year over year. The sequential and year over year increase was primarily driven by increased headcount and an increase in bad debt expense primarily to the COVID-19 impact of $1.2 million. G&A as a percentage of revenue was 24%, representing an increase of 2% sequentially and a decrease of 1% year over year. We continue to see operating leverage in the business as operating margin improved over 1000 basis points year over year and 600 basis points sequentially. Operating loss was $14.4 million in the first quarter, compared to $16.1 million in the same period last year. Net loss in the quarter or $12.3 million or net loss per share of $0.04, effective tax rate for Q1 was negative 8%. We ended the first quarter with $588 million in cash, cash equivalents available for sale securities.Q1 free cash flow first negative $30.6 million or 34% of revenue, compared to a negative $22.1 million or 36% of revenue in the same period last year. As we mentioned previously, we expect to see continued variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital and the growth in our enterprise business. Before moving to guidance for the second quarter in the full year, I would like to begin with our expectations for COVID-19 related impacts and the associated provisions, we factored into guidance. We performed rigorous analysis to understand both risks and opportunities in the current environment. We've factored into our outlook the challenges our customers have been facing our views of current and prior trends, and the customer behavior we have seen in our existing customers and pipelines. We saw a notable bifurcation across our customer base emerged during the quarter with significant acceleration among certain customers, for example, sales cycles that would have taken a quarter or two being compressed in today's given an urgent need, as well as some blowback from other customers who are highly affected. By COVID related challenges, particularly those in macro sensitive industries such as transportation, hospitality and retail. However, only approximately 8% of all businesses associated with highly effective transportation, hospitality and retail industries. During the quarter, we have sourced an increase on all the sales cycle which was extended by five days and expect similar sales dynamics to continue and potentially worsen leading to longer lead time deal closures. We also began to see an uptick in customer contract modification requests which speaks to March of 133 customers with a notable slowdown in April. In spite of the recent slowdown, our guidance assumes these requests will continue and reflect a headcount of roughly $2 million in the second quarter. We are committed to helping our customers through those challenging times and providing them with increased payment flexibility often in exchange for extended contract duration. We are fortunate that our strong margin profile and balance sheet enables us to provide support to our customers and needs, which we also believe will benefit our shareholders community over the long term. Despite these headwinds we remain uniquely positioned as a mission critical security and internet performance partner for all our customers. We have a large and diverse customer base and lending customers of all sizes across every industry and all geographies with no customer contributing more than 5% of revenue. In first quarter we met or that's our new customer ACV and customer renewal targets, our and our DSO trend is flat to down through the quarter. We also think it's important to point out that April has trended as planned from a net new ACB and renewals perspective. Since March we've seen organic inbound leads doubled and our customer pipeline that's reached this highest level on a weekly basis. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $93.5 million to $94.5 million representing an increase of 39% to 40% year over year. We expect operating loss in the range of $20 million to $19 million. The sequential increase primarily to anticipate hiring and on boarding set from Q1 and COVID related provisions, we expect net loss per share in the range of $0.06 to $0.05 assuming approximately 299 million common shares outstanding and be expecting the effective tax rate with a negative 1.7%. In light of the rigorous analysis, the farm we pleased to reaffirm our 2020 guidance for revenue operating loss and net loss per share despite the uncertainty in the total environment. As such respect for revenue in the range of 389 million to $393 million representing an increase of 36% to 37% year over year. As a reminder, we have a predictable subscription business with strong visibility into near term revenue. We expect operating loss in the range of $55 million to $61 million. We expect net loss per share in the range of $0.21 to $0.19 assuming approximately 301 million common shares outstanding, and we expect an effective tax rate will be negative 4%. In weighing both the headwinds and tailwinds of the current environment, we continue to remain optimistic about the demand for all offerings and our long-term opportunity. While the full impact of the macro economy from COVID-19 is still unfolding, we continue to closely monitor the business environment, and we believe our guidance is appropriately prudent. In closing, as we navigate through these uncertain times, we feel very privileged to be a mission critical pillar of our customers operations, and fortunate to be there for them when they need us most. We'd like to thank the Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication and resiliency in delivering exceptional service to our customers, partners, and communities. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan.\nSterling Auty: Listen, I know there's a ton of things that you had to get through, but one item that wasn't mentioned was you signed another noticeable partnership agreement in China during the quarter. Just wondering if you can give us some sense of, what that could mean to your growth in the region moving forward?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, thanks, Sterling for the question. We have been operating in China now for five years in partnership with Baidu, and I think what I've learned in China is that the Chinese tech community, it's a very big country is a very tight knit part of, very tight knit community. And I think that what we really did over the last five years is prove ourselves as a good partner. And so beginning of the end of 2019, we were approached by a number of different Chinese internet companies. We wanted to diversify the number of partners that we had in China. And we were in the fortunate position to be able to choose who we thought would be a great partner going forward. And JD Cloud really fits that bill incredibly well. And so we signed an agreement with them, it's going to take a little bit of time for us to get that online. But I'm incredibly excited about it. We're adding 50 new cities per year to a total of 150 pumps across China that will augment the existing network that we have outside with Baidu. And I think that there's a real opportunity here for us to extend what we think is very unique about Tesla, which is we are one global network that spans the entire world and allows our global customers to manage their traffic both inside and outside of Cloudflare through a single user interface. So while I'm excited about this, I think it decreases the risk that we have on China in terms of being dependent on one provider there. And I think there's a substantial amount of opportunity that this provides as the world recovers from what we're going through right now.\nSterling Auty: That makes a lot of sense. And then Thomas, one follow-up for you. Thank you for the information on the exposed industries like travel. You made the comments on the pay as you go program. But, a question I get a lot for investors is, how should we think about your business as you stratify between exposure to SMB versus mid market versus enterprise? How would you kind of characterize your business that way?\nThomas Seifert: I think we pointed out earlier that we really manage our go-to-market across the broadness of the funnel we have. So, there's not really a focus that shift from small to medium to big. It's really important for the efficiency of our business model, and I think this current crisis shows how important it is to manage across this broadness of the funnel. We were surprised how resilient our payers who go businesses and as you Matthew mentioned in his part of the script, it was the strongest part. It has the highest growth in 4 years in the segment, and shows you how important it is to deliver those services to small and medium sized companies and also developers so they, it's really important that we can continue to convey the message of managing across the progress of this funnel. That is what keeps our costs second acquisition load just keeps our go-to-market model efficient and you heard it in my script. Nobody saw significant strength in Europe in their first quarter. Following the investments leading from incremental fuel sales investments, we made at the end of last year, and that was based on the strength of our local pay as you go business. It continues to provide us the data we need in order to be to invest behind the demand.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nPhil Winslow: And Matthew, obviously you commented on just the sheer amount of volume that's going across the internet and your network as well with the video where from home it's etcetera. What are you talking about just yet this huge menu of solutions have there been any that stand out to you, you're seeing incremental enters, whether it be load balancing Argo, obviously, you mentioned teams, anything you'd highlight there based on sort of the environment that we're seeing right now?\nMatthew Prince: I think the thing that has been a real standout for this time has been Cloudflare for teams. We couldn't have, in some way got more fortunate to have announced that in January. That was a product that was new for us. We kind of knew there wasn't a lot of awareness in the market for it and as a result, it made it actually a very easy decision for us to say, as we were seeing businesses struggle for us to say let's make that that product free through September 1st and the response was really overwhelming. We signed up over 1,000 businesses to be using Cloudflare for teams and what was really inspiring for me is are we wanted to make sure that our main sales team was focused on closing the quarter and on-boarding customers onto products that generate revenue and we saw strong demand across our entire product base. And so we had we had people on Thomas's finance team on our customer support team on our engineering team, our product team, all raising their hands around the world saying we'll volunteer to do 30 minute on-boarding sessions with literally over 1,000 businesses. And so I think that has raised the awareness of that product very substantially and I think that will pay us dividends for a long time to come. I think in terms of the product has generated revenue. If you think about what Cloudflare is fundamentally, we're what the future of a network should look like, and that networks should be resilient. It should be secure. It should be reliable. And so, what we saw was that as more and more of the world shifted to relying on the internet in order to keep their businesses online, in order to continue to do that work, a modern network is what they needed. And so, that meant that, load balancing, firewall, security, all of the different functions came together. And I think that what this crisis really illustrated was, it really isn't about one product or another. Customers are looking for a suite where they can sort of say, hey, I don't have expertise here. I want you guys to have this, and that's why they're turning to Cloudflare. And I think that our platform strategy really has shown over Q1.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Caroline on for Heather. Thank you again for taking my question and hope you and your families are doing well. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the net expansion rate. Just having a diversified customer base, I'm curious, how had the retention rates been trending within your small midsize as well as enterprise customer base and then specifically the weakness in AsiaPac. Was that driven by the SMB customers? Or was there some changes in churn within the larger enterprise customers?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks for the question. So starting with SMB customers globally, I think that, looking at our pay-as-you-go business, that is a rough proximate for our SMB customers. And I think the thing that we were, I think pleasantly surprised by was that, globally that segment actually had its strongest growth that we've seen in any period of time. When we have seen customers in that segment, who have gone from paying customers and churn, what we're not seeing is them switching to another solution. We're seeing some instances where companies are going out of business. But again, this is a very small portion of our overall business, even the pay-as-you-go segment is a relatively small portion. But what we're more seeing is that they might just need some relief on their bill. And so, the number one thing that competes for our sort of pay-as-you-go subscription business is the free version of Cloudflare's products. And so, we're not losing them on our platform, but we're seeing them what they are struggling, downgrading. That said, the expansion in the pay-as-you-go business both through new customers as well as our existing customers upgrading to becoming paying customers is the strongest that we've seen in Q1 as we've seen in several years in the past, and I think that was a very pleasant surprise. And I think what that speaks to is, even small businesses are looking for ways to continue to operate, and that means more and more of them are turning into the internet. And that has actually been a tailwind for us. In terms of Asia, I think that, we had to some terms from some customers that, again, we're impacted by various factors of what was going on. In Asia, again I think there's nothing systemic to that. And in those cases, I think that we see that is a region that we're excited about going forward. So I definitely have not been exposure to the S&B market which was which is what drove the weakness in April.\nThomas Seifert: Let me give you some additional color, because I think it's very important that the first time we saw a revenue base, the DNR number at 117%, that is what you would expect from good performance our Q2, but like then you will see a higher level of volatility in this measurement because larger customers don't expand their business in a perfectly linear manner, and so that's why you will see some volatility there. Just what a few heard from Matthew from a revenue perspective, not so much from a billing and ACD perspective was also a bit more backend loaded as everybody paused for the end of March and never figured out how new procurement processes would look like that is certainly a reflection in there. And the trend in Asia is not really a regional topic. It's much more vertical topics where we saw a couple of customers churn off, that has a high exposure to the verticals that are to 19 impacted.\nUnidentified Analyst: I guess my follow-up really is Matthew. How do you see the competitive landscape post the crisis? I mean, are you currently seeing more conversations about replacements of the legacy on promise hunters?\nMatthew Prince: For sure we're hearing that. The CIOs that we've been talking to for a long time and they are sort of like, yes, I don't know about the cloud. I'm sort of still figuring out what my strategy is going to be. I think that the current crisis has just accelerated everyone move towards the cloud. We're seeing more and more people turning that that direction. And again, I think that we're already starting to have that as a tailwind for us. And I think that will continue for quite some time to go. There are a lot of Cisco bosses out there, that to be replaced. And I think that we've got a very full product suite to be able to do that. What we are not seeing is a lot of, again, competition that's pulling away our businesses. We see a very strong growth both with our existing customers and our ability to land new customers. And again, I think we're trying to be very prudent in terms of understanding the risk is that I don't think any of us know exactly how long this is going to go on, how much it's going to impact that overall business climate. But I think inevitably, as we come out, the world is going to look different, and it's going to be a world where more and more customers are excited to use a solution like Cloudflare.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Matthew, you have a lot of products that can aid to work from home trends. You've talked about them tonight. Just wanted some high level, can you talk more broadly about your exposure to this particular use case? And how you expect to continue to invest and also benefit from this long term trend that obviously is changing the way. I think all of us think about work.\nMatthew Prince: Well, I think, first of all, this is a terrible crisis, and there are -- we all have friends who have been impacted and are not able to work right now because their jobs do require them to go in restaurant workers and nail salons and hair, hair, cut hair. But I think that what I think we're as a as society overall fortunate about is that it didn't happen 10 years ago. And over the course of the last 10 years, we at Cloudflare, and lots of other companies have built out cloud solutions that can continue to allow people to work. And I've been we cover has traditionally been very much a work from office culture ourselves. And I was nervous when we switched almost overnight to globally being a work from home culture. And what I've seen is incredibly encouraging that our productivity is incredibly high. We're getting work done, we're closing deals. And it feels like we've not missed a beat. And I think that that's an illustration of what the business of the future looks like, which is how can we think about what are the best aspects of remote work and what are the best aspects of Working from offices. And a lot of the reason why we were able to do what we did was that we had the IP system in place to be able to support that. And a lot of those were products that we built for ourselves. And so I think having a reliable network, which is fundamentally what it is that Cloudflare provides, one that is performance, when it doesn't fail, when that is secure, no matter why that that is a foundational aspect of any work from home strategy. And then -- and so that is our business, and then on top of that, the fact that we've got clouds service teams, which today is not responsible for a lot of revenue, but is there a lot of interest based on what this is. I think that a solution like that is going to be a part of every company going forward, when they make sure that they have the flexibility if ever in the future 100% of their workforce has to work from home because of another outbreak or more likely, because going forward, I think that we're all going to realize that the future of work is going to be a mix of office and home. And I think we've got a big opportunity to play a role in that not just by providing that foundational secure reliable performance network, but then to provide additional solutions on top of that they can make working from home fast, secure, and productive.\nMatt Hedberg: That's great and immediate follow up. You have a unique perspective on China that's expanding now. I'm curious if you can talk about what you're seeing when people go back to work. How trends of China opening up might potentially impact and how the rest of the world is going to react to opening up?\nMatthew Prince: We have an office in Beijing. And so, we were very acutely aware of this crisis, I think maybe earlier than some other companies that might not have exposure to that region. Our team outside of China was quick to support our team inside of China. We shifted to an entirely remote work posture there. And then what's been interesting is I think it has -- well, they led the way in sheltering in place and adjusting in that way. They're now also leading the way in transitioning back out. And so, we have reopened our office in Beijing. We have designated that team in terms of a yellow team and a red team which split it up so that we don't have everyone in the office every day. We're practicing what are appropriate measures and we're watching as the Chinese economy and not just our team, but teams around the country are coming back online. And I think that that's part of it. China is an enormous market and whatever the current concerns are around the virus or the current concerns around trade tension, over the long term. I think there's almost no way that we don't find ways to reengage with that country. And what I'm proud of is that we are the one network that global companies that want to be able to operate inside the China and outside of China, whether they are Chinese base or they are based in the United States or anywhere else. We helped facilitate that movement of bits. And then I think, especially with the deal that we did with JD, they are really the on the ground logistics experts and I think that an incredible opportunity for companies that are outside of China to work with us, to be able to market through the Cloudflare network and then work with JD as a partner to actually get their goods in the hands of Chinese customers. And I think that's what you've got to invest in things like in network infrastructure. Well ahead of when this comes back then all of the signals that we're seeing are that this is going to come back and is obviously going to be a real source of economic growth for the world going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the quarterly results. Matthew or Thomas, I know that typically you do not provide the RPO metric officially on the call, but any color from a quantitative, maybe even from a qualitative perspective, that will be highly appreciated? And I have a follow-up.\nThomas Seifert: Normally, we don't talk about RPO, but I think given the economic backdrop, it's valid to ask for some more transparency. RPO, for us, it's well over 50% for the remaining the year 20 guidance, so backlog and deferred revenue, if you keep your mind that is primarily our contract business. So they're the second large contributor then would be the renewal base and our contract business. And especially in our pay-as-you-go business, which you heard from Matthew was specifically, exceptionally strong in the first quarter. So if you add those two together, you're probably already at 70% or slightly above and then new ACV is literally the smallest contributor and that's why we confidently can say based on 100% subscription business that the visibility we have into our especially near-term revenue is pretty solid.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. Thank you for this color. And also, when we think about those few thousand team businesses that joined during the quarter, if we translate this number into subscribers, what could that be like? Is in 1 million, 2 million, 3 million? Whatever colors you can share with us will be greatly appreciated? And also, if I can kind of stick another one, what things the renewal rate as we start in about 2021 of those 1,000 team businesses once they convert? What this renewal rate might look like down the road?\nThomas Seifert: We're coordinating in our independent sheltering in place. So, we're still mastering it. I say, we're not -- we don't know what that, that 1,000 businesses is going to turn into exactly. I am optimistic, as I said in my remarks that once you're part of somebody's infrastructure, that builds a relationship and builds trust and that will build business for us. But I think we're trying to be very conservative, because we don't know exactly what that will turn into. And so I think that we're not forecasting revenue based on that right now. And I think we'll we will know a lot more when we get to September.\nMatthew Prince: Listing this underline that you've been very conservative in our assumptions, how much revenue we will derive from this business in the remainder of the year. But in general, our cross dollar retention is in the 90s, across all paying customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein from SunTrust.\nJoel Fishbein: Matthew, I have one for you. On the commerce, I mean, you gave us a lot of very good metrics on your guidance. I wanted to ask you, what kind of testing did you do to look at how the downside risk was? Obviously, you have most of your businesses subscription and you talked about the song pipeline, but I'd love to hear that and I have one quick follow-up for you as well.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, let me started here. I think we really, we did not want to just assume that an automatic recovery would happen in the second quarter. So we really wanted to especially test the downside risk. And then the impact of the uncertainty around COVID might have. So we both probabilistic models and we use [Monte Carlo] simulation to understand, especially our exposure to verticals and industries that suffered in the 2010 and then 2008 crisis will be modeled against those default rates. We looked at customer size, we looked at conversion rates, so and run I don't know millions of sudden life runs around it really to understand the test the downside, not wanting to assume just in an automatic recovery in the second half.\nJoel Fishbein: Okay, and I guess as a follow up, I guess the anticipation of that is an April track ahead of plan and it sounds like the trends are this things like you are tracking a little bit better than that, as far as I could I guess what the message that we're supposed to have here?\nMatthew Prince: I think there's a lot of uncertainty in front of us. We wanted to be appropriately prudent in how we think about the remainder of the year. We have more visibility in the near term and I think that is reflected in the guidance for the second quarter and just more uncertainty in the second half and then there especially there, we wanted to understand the downside and I think this is prudent in a situation like this and the student guidance for the remainder of the year.\nJoel Fishbein: And then last one from me is real quick on the DSOs you were flat actually. Your customers are actually paying I'm assuming that yours expects DSOs to track up as we move forward unexpended payment terms?\nMatthew Prince: We have been conservative in our modeling. We have not seen any uptick in April either.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: The opportunity that they are just describing around really catalyzing, the shift towards security into this environment, how do you weigh the fact that a lot of people just had to double down on their common vendors just because there was a crisis mode, they had to pull forward firewall spending, without incumbency versus the ability to get these guys to move on a going forward basis?\nMatthew Prince: No, I think that, it's worth probing that. I will say that, I have been spending a lot of my time talking to CIOs very large fortune 50 institutions and that hasn't been what a concern that any of them have brought up. I think that they have made decisions to band aid their way through the current crisis. But I think that it's become very clear, having lived through it that again, what I hear over and over again is I never want to live through something like this again. And so that's the inbound interest that we're getting for our solution, especially from large customers is substantial and while I think that is a that's worth continuing to test and continuing to refine, it has not been a concern which has been brought up on a single call that we talked to. My hunch is that, in every board room you're hearing people who really witnessed the pain and a loss of productivity that relying on on-premise hardware imposed on them. And they're saying, we need a different architecture and right now, I think they're going to tolerate being able to switch over. I think we have the additional benefit that, because we're a subscription business, it doesn't have nearly the cash outlay that you have to have for trying to double down on hardware.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And Thomas, for you, one of the numbers pretty much across the board numbers came in the ahead of the guidance and ahead of expectations. One number that came in a little bit below expectations was free cash flow. You talked about some accelerated hardware purchases. There's also a lot of load on the overall network, any one time items or anything in particular weighing on free cash flow in Q1 that we should keep in mind when we're modeling the rest of the year?\nThomas Seifert: No. I think we are going to stay a year with the guidance we gave. This is really trying to manage through the crisis. We also were able to save some costs by paying certain things earlier. So, over the year there, I think that guidance is good, and as Matthew said, the infrastructure team did an extraordinary good job, making sure that early in the year in January already making sure our supply chain is protected and that weighed heavily on our cash flow in the first quarter. But that should balance out for the remainder of the year, we are well on track.\nOperator: That concludes question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to the presenters for final comments.\nA - Matthew Prince: Thank you everyone for tuning in. I want to just to say again how proud I am of the entire Cloudflare team. We're working under extraordinary conditions that I'm proud of the fact that you're all helping to make the internet function. Thanks to all the analysts, who tuned in and all of our shareholders. I hope everyone is safe and healthy and washing your hands often. And we'll talk to you again next quarter.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you Matt and thanks again to everyone for joining us. We continued the momentum from 2019 and delivered a strong first quarter, exceeding the high-end of our revenue guidance. We believe this reflects our critical role in helping customers transform and digitize their business models. Today, I plan to review our first quarter results, discuss the impact of COVID-19, provide guidance for the second quarter and update guidance for the full year of 2020. Turning to our results, total revenue for the first quarter grew 48% year-over-year to $91.3 million. The growth in revenue was driven by strong customer demand, both in terms of new logo acquisition as well as expansion within our existing customer base. As Matthew mentioned, we saw significant strengths with our pay-as-you-go business. Our pay-as-you-go customers are not committed to a contract, but rather are on a month-to-month subscription plan and predominantly composed of small and medium sized businesses. We believe the strength of this cohort during a global pandemic speaks to the value of Cloudflare network in the durability of our business model. To provide some additional transparency our pay-as-you-go customers represent the strong majority of our paying customer base. Our contract customers represent a strong majority of our revenue. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 40% of revenue, and increased 44% year-over-year. Our international business represented 62% of revenue and increased 62% year-over-year. International growth was driven primarily by Europe, which increased 58% year-over-year. We started making incremental sales investments in Europe last year to hide the traction in our pay-as-you-go business. We are pleased to see those investments start to take hold specific events from Germany and the UK. As a reminder, beginning this quarter, we shifted to revenue based KPIs and the way from billings as the basis for our KPIs. We believe this move to revenue based KPIs better aligns with our peer group of publicly disclosed financials and our business model as we continue to scale. We provided eight quarters of revenue based historical so comparison purposes, which can be referenced in this quarter supplemental financial information document on our Investor Relations website. We added approximately 250,000 total customers during the quarter to exit the quarter at roughly $2.8 million total free and paying customers representing an increase of 40% year-over-year. We also added over 5,000 paying customers in the first quarter, bringing the total number of paying customers to over 89,000. We remain focused on expansion within existing customers and growing our large enterprise customer base, and then just the quarter with 536 paying customers with greater than $100,000 in annualize revenue, which is up 65% year-over-year. Our first quarter dollar base net retention rate was 117%, which decreased 2% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The slight decline was largely driven by higher term in the Asia Pacific region. Dollar base net retention measures our ability to retain and expand revenue from existing customers in the prior year period. Our measurement this net of contraction net of churn and excludes the benefit of free customers that upgrades to take subscription. First quarter gross margin was 78.3%, down 48 basis points sequentially and up 150 basis points year-over-year. Network efficiency continues to be a defining strength of all business models, allowing us to absorb significantly higher rates of traffic and offer a critical solution like Cloudflare for Teams to new customers at no charge for September 1st. As we said previously, we'll use our gross margin advantage as a strategic weapon when opportunities present themselves. During this crisis, we are focused on doing the right thing for our customers to be and follow business in the long-term. Therefore, in second quarter, we expect to see gross margin closer to our long-term targets of 75% to 77%. Turning for our operating expenses, we remain focused on improving the leverage and our business while balancing investments for growth. Total operating expenses were $85.9 million for the first quarter up 2% sequentially, and 35% year over year, while we increase our headcount by 43% year over year, bringing our total number of employees to 1368 at the end of the quarter, we saw delay in hiring and on-boarding, which we expect to catch up in the current quarter. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 6% sequentially and 9% year over year to 94%. Sales and marketing expenses were $43.4 million for the quarter, representing a decrease of 1% sequentially and an increase of 42% year over year. The sequential decrease was largely due to swift production and travel, discretionary marketing spend in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, decrease the 48% from 49% in the first quarter last year, and from 52% last quarter. Research and development expenses for $20.5 million in the quarter, representing a decrease of 7% sequentially and an increase of 19% year over year. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 24% from 28% in Q1 last year, and from 26% last quarter. General and administrative expenses were $22 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 18% sequentially and 40% year over year. The sequential and year over year increase was primarily driven by increased headcount and an increase in bad debt expense primarily to the COVID-19 impact of $1.2 million. G&A as a percentage of revenue was 24%, representing an increase of 2% sequentially and a decrease of 1% year over year. We continue to see operating leverage in the business as operating margin improved over 1000 basis points year over year and 600 basis points sequentially. Operating loss was $14.4 million in the first quarter, compared to $16.1 million in the same period last year. Net loss in the quarter or $12.3 million or net loss per share of $0.04, effective tax rate for Q1 was negative 8%. We ended the first quarter with $588 million in cash, cash equivalents available for sale securities.Q1 free cash flow first negative $30.6 million or 34% of revenue, compared to a negative $22.1 million or 36% of revenue in the same period last year. As we mentioned previously, we expect to see continued variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital and the growth in our enterprise business. Before moving to guidance for the second quarter in the full year, I would like to begin with our expectations for COVID-19 related impacts and the associated provisions, we factored into guidance. We performed rigorous analysis to understand both risks and opportunities in the current environment. We've factored into our outlook the challenges our customers have been facing our views of current and prior trends, and the customer behavior we have seen in our existing customers and pipelines. We saw a notable bifurcation across our customer base emerged during the quarter with significant acceleration among certain customers, for example, sales cycles that would have taken a quarter or two being compressed in today's given an urgent need, as well as some blowback from other customers who are highly affected. By COVID related challenges, particularly those in macro sensitive industries such as transportation, hospitality and retail. However, only approximately 8% of all businesses associated with highly effective transportation, hospitality and retail industries. During the quarter, we have sourced an increase on all the sales cycle which was extended by five days and expect similar sales dynamics to continue and potentially worsen leading to longer lead time deal closures. We also began to see an uptick in customer contract modification requests which speaks to March of 133 customers with a notable slowdown in April. In spite of the recent slowdown, our guidance assumes these requests will continue and reflect a headcount of roughly $2 million in the second quarter. We are committed to helping our customers through those challenging times and providing them with increased payment flexibility often in exchange for extended contract duration. We are fortunate that our strong margin profile and balance sheet enables us to provide support to our customers and needs, which we also believe will benefit our shareholders community over the long term. Despite these headwinds we remain uniquely positioned as a mission critical security and internet performance partner for all our customers. We have a large and diverse customer base and lending customers of all sizes across every industry and all geographies with no customer contributing more than 5% of revenue. In first quarter we met or that's our new customer ACV and customer renewal targets, our and our DSO trend is flat to down through the quarter. We also think it's important to point out that April has trended as planned from a net new ACB and renewals perspective. Since March we've seen organic inbound leads doubled and our customer pipeline that's reached this highest level on a weekly basis. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $93.5 million to $94.5 million representing an increase of 39% to 40% year over year. We expect operating loss in the range of $20 million to $19 million. The sequential increase primarily to anticipate hiring and on boarding set from Q1 and COVID related provisions, we expect net loss per share in the range of $0.06 to $0.05 assuming approximately 299 million common shares outstanding and be expecting the effective tax rate with a negative 1.7%. In light of the rigorous analysis, the farm we pleased to reaffirm our 2020 guidance for revenue operating loss and net loss per share despite the uncertainty in the total environment. As such respect for revenue in the range of 389 million to $393 million representing an increase of 36% to 37% year over year. As a reminder, we have a predictable subscription business with strong visibility into near term revenue. We expect operating loss in the range of $55 million to $61 million. We expect net loss per share in the range of $0.21 to $0.19 assuming approximately 301 million common shares outstanding, and we expect an effective tax rate will be negative 4%. In weighing both the headwinds and tailwinds of the current environment, we continue to remain optimistic about the demand for all offerings and our long-term opportunity. While the full impact of the macro economy from COVID-19 is still unfolding, we continue to closely monitor the business environment, and we believe our guidance is appropriately prudent. In closing, as we navigate through these uncertain times, we feel very privileged to be a mission critical pillar of our customers operations, and fortunate to be there for them when they need us most. We'd like to thank the Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication and resiliency in delivering exceptional service to our customers, partners, and communities. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator please poll for questions. I think we pointed out earlier that we really manage our go-to-market across the broadness of the funnel we have. So, there's not really a focus that shift from small to medium to big. It's really important for the efficiency of our business model, and I think this current crisis shows how important it is to manage across this broadness of the funnel. We were surprised how resilient our payers who go businesses and as you Matthew mentioned in his part of the script, it was the strongest part. It has the highest growth in 4 years in the segment, and shows you how important it is to deliver those services to small and medium sized companies and also developers so they, it's really important that we can continue to convey the message of managing across the progress of this funnel. That is what keeps our costs second acquisition load just keeps our go-to-market model efficient and you heard it in my script. Nobody saw significant strength in Europe in their first quarter. Following the investments leading from incremental fuel sales investments, we made at the end of last year, and that was based on the strength of our local pay as you go business. It continues to provide us the data we need in order to be to invest behind the demand. Let me give you some additional color, because I think it's very important that the first time we saw a revenue base, the DNR number at 117%, that is what you would expect from good performance our Q2, but like then you will see a higher level of volatility in this measurement because larger customers don't expand their business in a perfectly linear manner, and so that's why you will see some volatility there. Just what a few heard from Matthew from a revenue perspective, not so much from a billing and ACD perspective was also a bit more backend loaded as everybody paused for the end of March and never figured out how new procurement processes would look like that is certainly a reflection in there. And the trend in Asia is not really a regional topic. It's much more vertical topics where we saw a couple of customers churn off, that has a high exposure to the verticals that are to 19 impacted. Normally, we don't talk about RPO, but I think given the economic backdrop, it's valid to ask for some more transparency. RPO, for us, it's well over 50% for the remaining the year 20 guidance, so backlog and deferred revenue, if you keep your mind that is primarily our contract business. So they're the second large contributor then would be the renewal base and our contract business. And especially in our pay-as-you-go business, which you heard from Matthew was specifically, exceptionally strong in the first quarter. So if you add those two together, you're probably already at 70% or slightly above and then new ACV is literally the smallest contributor and that's why we confidently can say based on 100% subscription business that the visibility we have into our especially near-term revenue is pretty solid. We're coordinating in our independent sheltering in place. So, we're still mastering it. I say, we're not -- we don't know what that, that 1,000 businesses is going to turn into exactly. I am optimistic, as I said in my remarks that once you're part of somebody's infrastructure, that builds a relationship and builds trust and that will build business for us. But I think we're trying to be very conservative, because we don't know exactly what that will turn into. And so I think that we're not forecasting revenue based on that right now. And I think we'll we will know a lot more when we get to September. No. I think we are going to stay a year with the guidance we gave. This is really trying to manage through the crisis. We also were able to save some costs by paying certain things earlier. So, over the year there, I think that guidance is good, and as Matthew said, the infrastructure team did an extraordinary good job, making sure that early in the year in January already making sure our supply chain is protected and that weighed heavily on our cash flow in the first quarter. But that should balance out for the remainder of the year, we are well on track."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. Let me start by saying what feels almost awkward to say given the circumstances. We had a very strong quarter. Our Q1 revenue finished at $91 million, up 48% year on year, we posted a gross margin of 78%, showing the continued efficiency of our platform. We made substantial progress on our path toward profitability, realizing over 1,000 basis points of operating leverage improvement year on year. That's the easy part. As I said in our first earnings call as a public company, we've been practicing mock earnings calls for years to the point that they already feel like business as usual. However, as I sat down to write up these remarks, I have to confess I struggled because what we're all living through is definitely not businesses as usual, so in many ways this isn't going to be a usual earnings call, settle in, buckle up. I wanted to take a bit more time to walk through four areas I've been focused on, our team, our platform, our business and our customers. And in particular I wanted to give you more of a sense of what we're seeing not just in the last quarter but focusing on March and April as the world reacted to COVID-19, first, our team. We're very fortunate that the first customer of all of Cloudflare's products is cloud by ourselves. We are digital natives and we're able to use our products like Cloudflare for teams to transition to productive and secure remote work. Our network operation center, security operation center and technical support center all continued to be fully, securely and reliably staffed 24/7, but it's not just about technology it's also an inspiring mission that empowers the team. Cloudflare's player's mission is to help build a better internet, I've just been banking or agricultural crisis who would likely have felt as powerless as many of our friends and colleagues at other companies do right now, but this was a crisis that caused us all worldwide to lean on the internet more than ever before. Undoubtedly, the superheroes of this crisis are the medical professionals and scientists taking care of the sick and searching for a cure to this disease, but the fateful sidekick, the Ant-Man's to Captain Marvel has been the internet, and as one of the guardians of the internet, I'm proud of how our team has risen to the occasion to support our customers new and old, as they deal with unprecedented challenges. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all our teams. You are working incredibly hard to ensure the internet continues to function while the world has needed it more than ever before. I'm proud of how well you've all kept up our level of productivity and excellence, and most importantly honored to see you support each other, as well as our millions of customers as we live through these challenging times together. Companies are really just collections of people and this crisis has reaffirmed to me. We have a great team. Second our platform, we growth in internet traffic has been unprecedented, across our platform. We saw as much growth in traffic in 12 weeks as we have seen in the previous 12 months. The flexibility of our platform for every server in every city can run every Cloudflare service has allowed us to continue to spread, load and serve all our customers. Stress does make systems better and our engineering team has used this time as a way to make our platform more efficient. For instance, our firewall team released a series of improvements that shaved 40% of the processing time on every request. That means we are doing full deep packet inspection and threat analysis in a fraction of a millisecond at our tremendous scale. It also means that our network has actually gotten faster during this crisis while at the same time acquiring less hardware. We expect these and many more innovations will pay dividends for years to come. One of the concerns we had early in the crisis was our supply chain, Cloudflare's sources, the hardware that powers our network through multiple ODM partners. These partners as well as the many component manufacturers they rely on for parts are largely based in Asia where the virus first hit. Beginning of early January in light of the app, the time unnamed virus, our infrastructure team thoroughly analyzed our supply chain identifying potential bottlenecks. We moved up some purchases of key components we thought may become constrained this proof pressure. Thus far, we've been able to continue to receive the equipment we needed without meaningful delay in order to expand our network during this time of unprecedented demand, and the demand has been unprecedented. We've seen internet traffic use nearly doubled through March and April versus the beginning of the year. Both global traffic has still increasing regionally, we are seeing network traffic plateau. Different categories of traffic have grown more than others. Demand for educational and kids content, arts and crafts and parenting content have all more than doubled. On the other hand, traffic to sites about sports scores travel and real estate has declined. The scalability and flexibility of our unified platform with its ability to serve our diverse customer base and distribute load globally has served us very well. Third, our business, I've given you the Q1 highlights, but let me zoom into March and April and give you more granularity in what we're seeing. Beginning in March, we saw a modest uptick in the length of our average sales cycle. That added a few days to our closing deals. However, our average sales cycle still remains well under a quarter and even with the modest uptick is shorter than it was just 12 months ago. Our sales in March were strong, finishing ahead of our plan. What was surprising to us was how much of marches business closed in the last week of the quarter. Our ability to close new business has continued without a break through April and to-date, we are tracking well to our plan for new business this quarter. Our read is that much of the world took a bit of a pause for a few weeks in mid March, well, companies figured out their remote procurement processes. But once those were figured out, deals for critical services like those cloud provides, our customers got done. One more view into what the data are showing us. We track our sales pipeline closely. While many things may still impact win rates, we are encouraged that we added more new pipeline in February than in January, more in March than in February, and more in April than in March. I'm proud of our team and while the demand is there, we have no intention of slowing down. Part of the key to our success comes back to our short sales cycle and our ability to sell services without sending accounts or professional service team on-premise. Businesses large and small have an acute need for a fast, reliable, secure network. Now more than ever, they come to us every hour of every day. And we can have them up and running as quickly as a few hours a minute compared to our competitors, weeks or months. And because of our short sales cycle, we can adapt quickly. As we came to understand that certain industries were going to be particularly impacted by the current crisis, we shifted our sales resources to thriving verticals, so our teams could still make their quarter. One surprise for the quarter was our pay as you go business. This segment is for customers who sign up with a credit card on month to month agreements and without talking to anyone on our sales team. Today, it's a small portion of our revenue, but it's our roots where we started over nine years ago. And so it's still very important. We were concerned this segment may be more impacted because of its exposure to small businesses and individual developers. To our surprise, last quarter, it had its strongest year-over-year growth in years. And it's continued to show strong growth in April. That won't make a big difference to our bottom line because it's a relatively small portion of our overall revenue. But I'm proud we're still there to serve the small businesses, startups and individual developers who need a service like Cloudflare now more than ever, businesses of all sizes and shapes are moving online to survive, and we are helping them. That's the good news, but it's not all rosy, we are seeing an uptick in requests for concessions. Thomas will give you more details, but I wanted to tell you how we're thinking about those requests. Based on our analysis of the customer base, and the industries that are most impacted, we believe the vast majority of our customers will get through this. Some however, may need short term help. We're using the strength of our balance sheet to help these customers in their time of need, build goodwill, and at the same time, working out beneficial terms to deepen our relationship over the long term. We are fortunate that because of the breadth of our product offerings delivered across our unified platform, we're often able to cost effectively bundle services together and help our customers replace legacy vendors, especially now, helping customers save money and simplify their operation leads to a particularly compelling ROI. Our competition with their narrower set of offerings does not have this luxury. Well, some hardware vendors may have had a temporary bump this quarter as CIOs scrambled to make sure they had enough firewall or VPN capacity, we believe that is short lived. Those same CIOs are emailing and me saying, we never want to go through something like this again. There's a cartoon circulating that asks, who led the digital transformation at your company, CEO, CTO for COVID-19. History may well record this crisis, as the last gasp for on premise network hardware. Similarly, there are a number of cloud providers that only offer limited point solutions. Our platform strategy has positioned us well for this current moment, and we are aggressively leveraging it to take market share. We're seeing a number of new prospects engage in conversations about to find ways of saving money by leveraging our robots more cost effective platform. To that end, as we said before, we will continue to use our gross margin as a weapon to gain share. As an example of that, in March we made the call to make Cloudflare for teams, which we just launched in January free for any business until September 1st. Cloudflare for teams solve an acute need as companies shifted to 100% remote work, and their existing firewall and VPN hardware solutions couldn't keep up. In the last few months, we've on boarded over 1,000 companies onto Cloudflare for teams. Since we made it free, right now they're all costs and no revenue. But we're proud of being there for businesses in their time of need. And what we've learned in the last nine years of running Cloudflare is that once you're part of some infrastructure, even apparently don't trust and that builds opportunity. In other words, we feel very fortunate with our results in the short term, we remain relentlessly focused on the long term. However, make no mistake. There will be headwinds in the short term. We are part of the broader economy and as businesses struggle and go out of business we will lose some customers. But long term, we believe we are well positioned to be one of the few networks that will help run a large portion of the internet. So, lastly, I wanted to talk about some of our customer wins for the quarter. We had some incredible wins like a credit reporting service and signed a three year deal worth $800,000 per year, a major gaming platform with a deal worth over a million dollars per year, a reinsurance provider who will pay us $750,000 over three years to protect their network and a U.S. government agency using a broad set of our platforms features to secure nuclear research for over $150,000 per year. So, let me focus on some customers that are uniquely relevant to this moment. One of the largest telemedicine providers in the United States turned to Cloudflare as the crisis set in they had to shift the majority of their physicians from clinics where they have legacy on premise security hardware to their homes where obviously they did not. As a highly regulated industry, security of patient information is critical, they on-boarded their positions onto clapper for teams, so they could keep serving patients. Here's what their CIO said about the experience, ''I wish we had done this years ago after seeing how easy it was. Beautiful. This is perfect. I mean on so many levels. I love that''. Accompanying many of us are relying on just deliver food to our Homes while we shelter-in-place, signed a deal for over $600,000 per year in January. In March their demand was up so much they increased their deal by more than $500,000 per year. One of their goals was to ensure that, they could decrease their dependency on Amazon web services. They found Cloudflare was not only faster and more robust, but also significantly more cost effective and they're using Cloudflare Workers, our edge computing platform to solve a handful of development challenges they couldn't through any other platform. Beyond the customers who paid us, we're also proud of the customers doing critical work we could support through our project Galileo initiative. Last quarter, we helped to ensure fast, reliable, secure access for projects like covidenearyou.org a project created by Harvard Epidemiologists and software developers to track COVID-19 hotspots, maskaherony.com, which facilitated the donation of more than 27,000 masks, the medical professionals in New York City, theamerican.org, which is providing emotional support, resources and suicide prevention for the millions of lonely people impacted by this crisis, beatcovid19now.org develop high esteem of Australian public health and IT researchers to track and make sense of COVID-19 symptoms and many, many, many more. It is inspiring to our whole team that we are able to lend our technology and expertise to help the true superheroes behind these organizations. Finally, this is a hard time, no doubt, and there will be headwinds even for a business like ours, but it's also replete with opportunity. My message to our team has been clear. Iconic companies are born out of crisis. They take these opportunities to do two things, focus and invest. So, we are focusing on the products and innovation that leads to the highest returns, and we are investing in building trust, hiring the greatest people and establishing ourselves for the long-term. There are a small number of companies that will power the future of the Internet. We feel very fortunate, very privileged and very lucky to be one of the Internet's guardians during this crisis. And I'm confident that, will serve us well as we strive to build an iconic company over the long-term. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. Yes, thanks, Sterling for the question. We have been operating in China now for five years in partnership with Baidu, and I think what I've learned in China is that the Chinese tech community, it's a very big country is a very tight knit part of, very tight knit community. And I think that what we really did over the last five years is prove ourselves as a good partner. And so beginning of the end of 2019, we were approached by a number of different Chinese internet companies. We wanted to diversify the number of partners that we had in China. And we were in the fortunate position to be able to choose who we thought would be a great partner going forward. And JD Cloud really fits that bill incredibly well. And so we signed an agreement with them, it's going to take a little bit of time for us to get that online. But I'm incredibly excited about it. We're adding 50 new cities per year to a total of 150 pumps across China that will augment the existing network that we have outside with Baidu. And I think that there's a real opportunity here for us to extend what we think is very unique about Tesla, which is we are one global network that spans the entire world and allows our global customers to manage their traffic both inside and outside of Cloudflare through a single user interface. So while I'm excited about this, I think it decreases the risk that we have on China in terms of being dependent on one provider there. And I think there's a substantial amount of opportunity that this provides as the world recovers from what we're going through right now. I think the thing that has been a real standout for this time has been Cloudflare for teams. We couldn't have, in some way got more fortunate to have announced that in January. That was a product that was new for us. We kind of knew there wasn't a lot of awareness in the market for it and as a result, it made it actually a very easy decision for us to say, as we were seeing businesses struggle for us to say let's make that that product free through September 1st and the response was really overwhelming. We signed up over 1,000 businesses to be using Cloudflare for teams and what was really inspiring for me is are we wanted to make sure that our main sales team was focused on closing the quarter and on-boarding customers onto products that generate revenue and we saw strong demand across our entire product base. And so we had we had people on Thomas's finance team on our customer support team on our engineering team, our product team, all raising their hands around the world saying we'll volunteer to do 30 minute on-boarding sessions with literally over 1,000 businesses. And so I think that has raised the awareness of that product very substantially and I think that will pay us dividends for a long time to come. I think in terms of the product has generated revenue. If you think about what Cloudflare is fundamentally, we're what the future of a network should look like, and that networks should be resilient. It should be secure. It should be reliable. And so, what we saw was that as more and more of the world shifted to relying on the internet in order to keep their businesses online, in order to continue to do that work, a modern network is what they needed. And so, that meant that, load balancing, firewall, security, all of the different functions came together. And I think that what this crisis really illustrated was, it really isn't about one product or another. Customers are looking for a suite where they can sort of say, hey, I don't have expertise here. I want you guys to have this, and that's why they're turning to Cloudflare. And I think that our platform strategy really has shown over Q1. Yes. Thanks for the question. So starting with SMB customers globally, I think that, looking at our pay-as-you-go business, that is a rough proximate for our SMB customers. And I think the thing that we were, I think pleasantly surprised by was that, globally that segment actually had its strongest growth that we've seen in any period of time. When we have seen customers in that segment, who have gone from paying customers and churn, what we're not seeing is them switching to another solution. We're seeing some instances where companies are going out of business. But again, this is a very small portion of our overall business, even the pay-as-you-go segment is a relatively small portion. But what we're more seeing is that they might just need some relief on their bill. And so, the number one thing that competes for our sort of pay-as-you-go subscription business is the free version of Cloudflare's products. And so, we're not losing them on our platform, but we're seeing them what they are struggling, downgrading. That said, the expansion in the pay-as-you-go business both through new customers as well as our existing customers upgrading to becoming paying customers is the strongest that we've seen in Q1 as we've seen in several years in the past, and I think that was a very pleasant surprise. And I think what that speaks to is, even small businesses are looking for ways to continue to operate, and that means more and more of them are turning into the internet. And that has actually been a tailwind for us. In terms of Asia, I think that, we had to some terms from some customers that, again, we're impacted by various factors of what was going on. In Asia, again I think there's nothing systemic to that. And in those cases, I think that we see that is a region that we're excited about going forward. So I definitely have not been exposure to the S&B market which was which is what drove the weakness in April. For sure we're hearing that. The CIOs that we've been talking to for a long time and they are sort of like, yes, I don't know about the cloud. I'm sort of still figuring out what my strategy is going to be. I think that the current crisis has just accelerated everyone move towards the cloud. We're seeing more and more people turning that that direction. And again, I think that we're already starting to have that as a tailwind for us. And I think that will continue for quite some time to go. There are a lot of Cisco bosses out there, that to be replaced. And I think that we've got a very full product suite to be able to do that. What we are not seeing is a lot of, again, competition that's pulling away our businesses. We see a very strong growth both with our existing customers and our ability to land new customers. And again, I think we're trying to be very prudent in terms of understanding the risk is that I don't think any of us know exactly how long this is going to go on, how much it's going to impact that overall business climate. But I think inevitably, as we come out, the world is going to look different, and it's going to be a world where more and more customers are excited to use a solution like Cloudflare. Well, I think, first of all, this is a terrible crisis, and there are -- we all have friends who have been impacted and are not able to work right now because their jobs do require them to go in restaurant workers and nail salons and hair, hair, cut hair. But I think that what I think we're as a as society overall fortunate about is that it didn't happen 10 years ago. And over the course of the last 10 years, we at Cloudflare, and lots of other companies have built out cloud solutions that can continue to allow people to work. And I've been we cover has traditionally been very much a work from office culture ourselves. And I was nervous when we switched almost overnight to globally being a work from home culture. And what I've seen is incredibly encouraging that our productivity is incredibly high. We're getting work done, we're closing deals. And it feels like we've not missed a beat. And I think that that's an illustration of what the business of the future looks like, which is how can we think about what are the best aspects of remote work and what are the best aspects of Working from offices. And a lot of the reason why we were able to do what we did was that we had the IP system in place to be able to support that. And a lot of those were products that we built for ourselves. And so I think having a reliable network, which is fundamentally what it is that Cloudflare provides, one that is performance, when it doesn't fail, when that is secure, no matter why that that is a foundational aspect of any work from home strategy. And then -- and so that is our business, and then on top of that, the fact that we've got clouds service teams, which today is not responsible for a lot of revenue, but is there a lot of interest based on what this is. I think that a solution like that is going to be a part of every company going forward, when they make sure that they have the flexibility if ever in the future 100% of their workforce has to work from home because of another outbreak or more likely, because going forward, I think that we're all going to realize that the future of work is going to be a mix of office and home. And I think we've got a big opportunity to play a role in that not just by providing that foundational secure reliable performance network, but then to provide additional solutions on top of that they can make working from home fast, secure, and productive. We have an office in Beijing. And so, we were very acutely aware of this crisis, I think maybe earlier than some other companies that might not have exposure to that region. Our team outside of China was quick to support our team inside of China. We shifted to an entirely remote work posture there. And then what's been interesting is I think it has -- well, they led the way in sheltering in place and adjusting in that way. They're now also leading the way in transitioning back out. And so, we have reopened our office in Beijing. We have designated that team in terms of a yellow team and a red team which split it up so that we don't have everyone in the office every day. We're practicing what are appropriate measures and we're watching as the Chinese economy and not just our team, but teams around the country are coming back online. And I think that that's part of it. China is an enormous market and whatever the current concerns are around the virus or the current concerns around trade tension, over the long term. I think there's almost no way that we don't find ways to reengage with that country. And what I'm proud of is that we are the one network that global companies that want to be able to operate inside the China and outside of China, whether they are Chinese base or they are based in the United States or anywhere else. We helped facilitate that movement of bits. And then I think, especially with the deal that we did with JD, they are really the on the ground logistics experts and I think that an incredible opportunity for companies that are outside of China to work with us, to be able to market through the Cloudflare network and then work with JD as a partner to actually get their goods in the hands of Chinese customers. And I think that's what you've got to invest in things like in network infrastructure. Well ahead of when this comes back then all of the signals that we're seeing are that this is going to come back and is obviously going to be a real source of economic growth for the world going forward. Listing this underline that you've been very conservative in our assumptions, how much revenue we will derive from this business in the remainder of the year. But in general, our cross dollar retention is in the 90s, across all paying customers. Yes, let me started here. I think we really, we did not want to just assume that an automatic recovery would happen in the second quarter. So we really wanted to especially test the downside risk. And then the impact of the uncertainty around COVID might have. So we both probabilistic models and we use [Monte Carlo] simulation to understand, especially our exposure to verticals and industries that suffered in the 2010 and then 2008 crisis will be modeled against those default rates. We looked at customer size, we looked at conversion rates, so and run I don't know millions of sudden life runs around it really to understand the test the downside, not wanting to assume just in an automatic recovery in the second half. I think there's a lot of uncertainty in front of us. We wanted to be appropriately prudent in how we think about the remainder of the year. We have more visibility in the near term and I think that is reflected in the guidance for the second quarter and just more uncertainty in the second half and then there especially there, we wanted to understand the downside and I think this is prudent in a situation like this and the student guidance for the remainder of the year. We have been conservative in our modeling. We have not seen any uptick in April either. No, I think that, it's worth probing that. I will say that, I have been spending a lot of my time talking to CIOs very large fortune 50 institutions and that hasn't been what a concern that any of them have brought up. I think that they have made decisions to band aid their way through the current crisis. But I think that it's become very clear, having lived through it that again, what I hear over and over again is I never want to live through something like this again. And so that's the inbound interest that we're getting for our solution, especially from large customers is substantial and while I think that is a that's worth continuing to test and continuing to refine, it has not been a concern which has been brought up on a single call that we talked to. My hunch is that, in every board room you're hearing people who really witnessed the pain and a loss of productivity that relying on on-premise hardware imposed on them. And they're saying, we need a different architecture and right now, I think they're going to tolerate being able to switch over. I think we have the additional benefit that, because we're a subscription business, it doesn't have nearly the cash outlay that you have to have for trying to double down on hardware."

Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jayson. In the immortal words of Bill and Ted, we had a most excellent quarter. In Q4, we achieved revenue of $194 million, up 54% year-over-year. We added 156 new large customers, those that spend more than $100,000 a year with us, ending the year with 1,416 large customers, up 71% year-over-year. Our dollar-based net retention ticked up to a record 125%, improving 6 percentage points from a year ago. For the full year, we earned $656 million, up 52% year-over-year. 2021 becomes our fifth straight year with 50% or greater compounded growth. I am proud of two things. First, over those 5 years, our growth has actually accelerated; but second, and probably more important, our growth has been relentlessly consistent. We have dialed in our business. We understand and we are in control of its levers. You can see that in metrics like our gross margin. While talk across the industry is about increasing cost and pricing pressure, we achieved a gross margin of 79%. That remains above our long-term target gross margin range of 75% to 77% and creates some opportunities. We expect to use this exceptional gross margin as a weapon to take business from competitors more vulnerable than we are to pricing and cost pressures. It also allows us to bundle together products into an overall platform no competitor can match. In Q3, we had our first quarter as a public company with positive operating margins. This is our second. It won\u2019t be our last. That said, as I talked about last quarter, we are not in a rush to be significantly profitable. Over the years, our team is asking about profitability. The story I told them was to imagine every year you saw your neighbor shoveling money into a machine. A year later, a lot more money came out. Year after year, the money kept piling up and getting shoveled back in. If, one year, you look at your window and didn\u2019t see your neighbor shoveling all the money back into the machine you would worry, what\u2019s wrong with the machine? To be clear, there is nothing wrong with our machine. We will continue to shovel money back in to drive innovation and reach new customers as long as we can achieve exceptional growth. We think of managing our operating margin a bit like that game Flappy Bird, not too high, not too low, for as long as we can, we want our operating margin to hold just above breakeven and right where it\u2019s been for the last two quarters. In other words, we have done something wrong if we beat significantly on EPS. Cash flow, on the other hand, nobody is going to complain if there is more cash in your bank account at the end of the quarter than there was at the beginning. We are proud that this is Cloudflare\u2019s first quarter since we have been public to be free cash flow positive. It also won\u2019t be our last. We know this is a business that can generate significant cash flows when we want. In the short-term, we expect we will see negative cash flows for the next two quarters as we invest in our network and redesign our physical offices for a post-COVID world. But by the second half of the year, we forecast we will be free cash flow positive. We admire and seek to emulate other companies that came before us and had significant cash flows while holding operating margins at breakeven. And we feel very dialed in and confident in our business as we come out of the uncertainty over the last 2 years. So, what\u2019s our secret? It\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s many. It starts with innovation. When we talk to customers, what they appreciate about Cloudflare is our relentless innovation. It expands our market and ensures that customers can use us to be the complete future of their corporate network. But beyond new products, we leverage economies of scale and network effects to drive our business and innovate more efficiencies. Yes, the supply chain has gotten harder, but we have leveraged our relationships, hyper-efficient procurement team and fully software-defined network to keep driving our costs down. Network effects are spawned by networks and we have run one of the largest networks in the world. As customers join our network, our network gets better and more efficient. If you want to understand how we have been able to continue to drive our business at this rate, this virtual cycle is where to look. And because it\u2019s a flywheel, this efficiency allows us to continue to invest in products. Our team love launching new products and we are planning at least 7 innovation weeks full of new products in 2022, further extending our network, introducing new capabilities and growing our TAM. The products we announced in 2021 are already thriving. For example, we had over 200,000 domains sign-up for our e-mail routing service and seemingly overnight to become a major e-mail security provider. R2, our zero egress office store, has had more than 9,000 sign-ups for its closed beta, including some incredible logos. It represents hundreds of petabytes of storage and demonstrates the palpable excitement around our workers\u2019 developer platform. We are on track for R2 to progress to open beta in Q2 and then be generally available in the second half of 2022. While our bias is toward internal product development, we will make strategic acquisitions when we find teams and products that can complement what we have built. I am excited to announce today that we have acquired Vectrix, a startup that has built the easiest to use, most powerful CASB we have seen. CASBs, cloud access security brokers, are a category of services that give visibility and control over data stored in SaaS applications. They can be powerful tools, but their Achilles\u2019 heel has always been their complex setup. The Vectrix team impressed us with how quickly they could onboard any new customer regardless of size and instantly gives them visibility into all the service providers where the customers\u2019 data was stored. As such, their product is a natural add-on to every current Cloudflare customer. They remind me of Cloudflare and our philosophy since our earliest days. The Vectrix team and technology further rounds out our Zero Trust platform, giving visibility not only for data flowing across the network, but now also data at rest in service providers. We believe it makes Cloudflare Zero Trust a no-brainer, comprehensive security solution for any company and we are thrilled to have the Vectrix team onboard. Let me highlight some great wins we have at Zero Trust and other products over the quarter. A global Fortune 500 telecommunications company signed a $1 million annual contract for over 100,000 Zero Trust seats. This customer initially started on a self-service plan with fewer than 500 seats 2 years ago. This win shows how the ease of use of our service and ability to land customers with individual teams within organizations can efficiently turn them into major customers over time. A Fortune 500 media company signed a $250,000 annual contract for more than 10,000 Zero Trust seats. It was a competitive deal, but ultimately, they selected us for being the most flexible and innovative solution on the market. What\u2019s great about wins like these is that there is an opportunity for us to expand the customers across our entire platform. You earn your place as a platform one feature at a time. Customers often work with us to solve a problem and then over time, give us a chance to compete for more of their business. And we saw exactly that with other customers this quarter. For instance, a Fortune 500 financial services company expanded their use of our platform by signing a $900,000 3-year expansion deal, bringing their annual contract value to over $1.5 million. They described us as \u201cfuture proof.\u201d It\u2019s an example of us bundling our platform to give them access to a broad set of our features while minimizing procurement friction. A Fortune 1000 shipping and logistics company signed a similar platform bundled deal, which more than doubles their 3-year contract value to $3 million. They specifically appreciated how Cloudflare was a single vendor they could turn to, to deliver the future of their corporate network. A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company signed a $750,000 3-year deal for network securities. It continues to be true that as companies migrate their on-premise hardware solutions, they continue to turn to Cloudflare to build the future of their networks. And as we come out the other side of COVID, we are seeing more and more companies rethink their network design and moving to the cloud and away from on-premise boxes. A Fortune 500 retailer moved away from two competitors in order to take advantage of Cloudflare Workers. While the competitors have promised similar functionality, they found it simply didn\u2019t work as promised. They signed a 3-year $1.2 million contract. Our Workers platform, which has been in production now for 4.5 years, continues to extend its lead with developers. And you didn\u2019t have to be a Fortune 500 company to sign a big deal with us this quarter. One of the most innovative payment startups signed a 3-year $1.5 million contract for our network security products. They appreciate Cloudflare Workers and the flexibility it provided them to service a broad set of merchants worldwide. Finally, in our business, we need to stay on top of cybersecurity issues globally. We are therefore watching the situation in Ukraine closely. Modern warfare increasingly includes the cyber battlefield. While they don\u2019t generate meaningful revenue, we have onboarded a number of Ukrainian businesses, news outlets and government organizations in anticipation of potential attacks. While we hope the current tensions will resolve peacefully, we have experienced mitigating nations-based cyberattacks and we are prepared to defend our customers and network whatever may come. Before I turn it over to Thomas, I wanted to thank the entire Cloudflare team for all your hard work and dedication. It was a most outstanding quarter and a most outstanding year. I am excited for what we are going to achieve together in 2022. And with that, Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew and thank you to everyone for joining us. We delivered another excellent quarter and wrapped up an incredible year. In 2021, we achieved multiple records and milestones and ended the year, with accelerated revenue growth. Large customer additions continue to outpace top line revenue growth and we achieved a record 125% dollar-based net retention rate in the fourth quarter. We continue to deliver over 50% compound annual growth rate on revenue since 2016 and remained profitable since the third quarter. These achievements reinforce our track record of delivering strong revenue growth at scale with increasingly strong unit economics, benefiting from the inherent strength of our business. Turning to revenue, total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 54% year-over-year to $193.6 million. The growth in revenue was driven by another quarter of strong customer demand both in terms of new local acquisitions as well as expansion within our existing customer base. We ended the fiscal year with revenue of $656.4 million, representing an increase of 52% year-over-year. As I just mentioned, this makes it our fifth year of delivering at least 50% compound annual growth rate on revenue since 2016, a testament to the consistency and durability of our business model. From a geographic perspective in Q4, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 52% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 60% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 29% year-over-year. We are pleased to see growth accelerate in APAC and see EMEA repeat as our highest growth geography. EMEA continues to benefit from a number of data localization suite wins driven by the increasing focus on GDPR and data privacy regulations. Turning to our customer metrics, we exited the quarter with 140,096 paying customers, representing an increase of 26% year-over-year. We ended the year with 1,416 large customers, representing an increase of 71% year-over-year. We added 156 large customers in the quarter and 588 large customers in the fiscal year. We are also providing an annual update on a few key large customer metrics, including large customer revenue contributions. Our large customers have not only grown in numbers, but also the average spend with us, causing their revenue contribution to continue to climb through the year. For fiscal 2021, large customers represented 54% of total revenue compared to 46% of total revenue in 2020. For the full year, we are also breaking out our large customers into cohorts of those with spend greater than $500,000 and $1 million. We ended the year with 121 customers that spend over $500,000 with us, a 70% increase year-over-year. We ended the year with 56 customers that spend over $1 million with us, a 75% increase year-over-year. The significant expansion from our large customers contributed to a record dollar-based net retention rate of 125%, representing an increase of 100 basis points sequentially. We continue to see broad-based strength across our customer base and robust traction and growth in our large customer cohorts, which continues to outpace top line revenue growth. Gross retention remains over 90% and customer expansion continues to be fueled by compelling unit economics and increasingly favorable customer acquisition cost. We will keep investing heavily in building our enterprise portfolio in developing a world class go-to-market strategy to position us for the massive opportunity ahead. Moving to gross margin, fourth quarter gross margin was 79.2% consistent with last quarter. Network CapEx represented 10% of revenue in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we added roughly 29,000 paying customers, representing an increase of 26% year-over-year. Traffic volumes have also increased significantly. In the fourth quarter, traffic volumes grew by 88% compared to the same quarter last year. Despite these significant increases, we were able to maintain network CapEx as a percentage of revenue at 11% and a high gross margin of 78.6% for fiscal 2021. This underscores the resiliency of our network and our ability to use gross margin as a strategic weapon to gain market share. Going forward, we plan to accelerate investments in our global network and expect network CapEx to be 12% to 14% of revenue for fiscal 2022. Turning to operating expenses, fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and decreased 4% year-over-year to 78%. We had another strong hiring quarter, where we saw our total number of employees increased 36% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to approximately 2,440 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $86 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially, decreased to 44% from 46% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $37 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue stayed flat sequentially and decreased to 19% from 20% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $28 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue stayed flat sequentially and decreased to 14% from 16% in the same quarter last year. We saw continued operating leverage in the fourth quarter with operating margins improving 550 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was $2.2 million compared to an operating loss of $5.5 million in the same period last year. Q4 was our second consecutive quarter of achieving operating profit. And as a reminder, we intend to grow our operating expenses in line with revenue, stay near or at breakeven and reinvest excess profitability back into the business to address the enormous opportunity in front of us. Turning to net income and the balance sheet, our net income in the quarter was $131,000 or net income per share of $0.00. Tax expenses for the fourth quarter, was $1.9 million. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $8.6 million or 4% of revenue compared to negative $23.5 million or 19% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was $40.6 million in the fourth quarter or 21% of revenue. This represented an increase of $47.5 million sequentially and an increase of $49.4 million year-over-year, helped by strong cash collection and growth of new and existing business. We are very pleased to have achieved our first free cash flow positive quarter as a public company. Going forward, we expect to see some variability in the first half of 2022 as we continue to invest in building refurbishments and network capacity, but we do expect to return to positive free cash flow in the second half of 2022. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $624 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially and 63% year-over-year. Current RPO was 77% of total RPO. The strength we saw in the fourth quarter across top line, bottom line and RPO in combination with our rate of innovation that allows us to continuously expand TAM gives us confidence and visibility heading into the new year. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $205 million to $206 million, representing an increase of 48% to 49% year-over-year. We expect operating income to be in the range of $500,000 to $1.5 million, and we expect a net income per share of zero to $0.01, assuming approximately 348 million common shares outstanding. We expect tax expense of $1.7 million. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $927 million to $931 million, representing an increase of 41% to 42% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $10 million to $14 million, and we expect net income per share over that period in the range of $0.03 to $0.04, assuming approximately 352 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $8 million. In closing, it has been a remarkable year for Cloudflare as we finish our second full year as a publicly traded company. I would like to thank our customers, partners and the community for their endless trust and support in us. And I want to thank all Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication to innovate and deliver in serving our customers and global community. We\u2019ve built a culture of relentless innovation, powerful platform and the successful go-to-market strategy grounded by an exceptionally efficient and durable business model. This positions Cloudflare at the forefront of a tremendous opportunity as the corporate network transitions to the cloud and develop a lineup to build on our edge. In 2022, we will continue to invest in innovative new products and expand our total addressable market by turning point solutions into features of our global network. I\u2019m extremely proud of what we have accomplished, and I\u2019m excited for this year. With that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, thanks, guys. Congrats on a great end to a great year. I wanted to focus on two initiatives that were announced in the fall. First was the global backbone. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a sense for just the strategic thought behind building that out sort of overlay, so to speak, on top of the virtual background that you have in place that we know Cloudflare for? And then also just Cloudflare for Offices, how does that complement what you\u2019re doing on the global backbone side in terms of, call it, being the most global but also the most local?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Phil, thanks for the question. We are always looking at our network and asking ourselves how can we make it faster? How can we make it more reliable? And how can we make it more efficient. And I think the backbone is one of the things that checks all three of those boxes. We have enough traffic across our network, that it is now more efficient for us, meaning it is less expensive for us to run over our own private connections than it is over the public Internet in many cases. On top of that, every time you add another provider, and especially when you add a provider you have complete control over, that allows you to optimize for the performance and reliability. And with our own backbone, because we sit at both sides of that, we can actually do things that you can\u2019t do over the public Internet. We can support larger packet sizes. We can actually support protocols that aren\u2019t supported across the standard Internet. And that allows us to really live up to our mission of helping build what is literally a better Internet and give our customers an experience they can\u2019t find anywhere else. In terms of Cloudflare for Offices, what we have heard from our customers is that as they want to take advantage of all of our different services, they want to be able to plug in to us as easily as possible. And so we are trying to offer on-ramps to them to be able to get on to our network and take advantage of our zero trust offering, make sure that their offices are protected from attack and make that as easy as just plugging in a patch cable. One of the things that we saw in the second half of 2021 was a real increase in cyber attacks directed directly at the network offices. It used to be once upon a time that DDoS attacks only went after, for example, your corporate marketing website. Now that more and more people are relying on virtual desktops or relying on zero trust network initiatives, attackers are smart to that and know that they can cause more harm. And therefore, extract larger ransoms by going after the networks themselves. If we can make it so that you as a \u2013 one of our customers, really never touches the public Internet, you go straight from your office and router there to ours, that isolates you from attackers. And so we think that, that\u2019s something that is extremely attractive, again, at checking all those boxes. Being more cost effective for us to run being more reliable, being more performant and in addition to that, really being more secure. So I think those things all line up. And again, I think we\u2019ve seen, especially with Cloudflare for Offices, early success in terms of adoption, and it\u2019s somewhere that we continue to invest, and we\u2019re very excited about.\nPhil Winslow: Great, thanks. And then a quick follow-up for Thomas, obviously, you continue to have success in larger deals with enterprises. When you look at just the go-to-market motion, how are you feeling in terms of productivity and ramp time of the new hires? And how do you think about that coming into this new year? Thanks.\nThomas Seifert: Very optimistic. So we\u2019ve seen that despite the growth we have seen over the last couple of years, and despite the fact that we successfully moved up the enterprise stack to larger and larger customers with larger and larger ATBs that we\u2019ve been able, not only to keep the productivity of the quota-carrying employees, but also the ramp curve getting them to put productivity has not changed. And our average sales cycle still continues to be on the 90 days. So that\u2019s \u2013 when we talk about the durability and the consistency of the business model, that\u2019s one of the impressive vectors that we\u2019ve been able to keep those productivity levels despite the fact that the go-to-market motion has successfully migrated to larger and larger accounts.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks, guys. Keep up the great work.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. My congrats as well on a really strong year. Matthew, you called out a lot of really exciting workers deals this quarter, which is really good to see. I think it\u2019s one of the things that we all sort of are excited about longer term. I\u2019m wondering at this point, now that it\u2019s been out for a number of years, is there some way that you can help us understand maybe usage trends or penetration of workers in your base?\nMatthew Prince: Matt, we\u2019re extremely excited about how workers is being adopted across our customer base. We still see that north of 20% of new enterprise deals include workers at some level. But I think what\u2019s even more exciting is that as we go down market and look at individual developers because the people who actually have their hands on keyboards are who are the most important, we see an enormous amount of excitement there. So a couple of different things. I think that this is the year that we will have through a critical milestone of developers, which is how do you get to 1 million developers that are using the Workers\u2019 platform. We see a clear path to that over the course of 2022. And I think that, that\u2019s going to be a really exciting milestone for us. I think the other piece is that we are starting to see companies that are being built entirely on workers. And so there was actually a startup company called Zaraz, which was built entirely using workers to optimize the marketing stack and build a much more secure, much more performance and much more privacy-friendly sort of marketing, whether that\u2019s pixels or tags that are on pages still that in a way that was much more friendly, we met that team. They worked with us closely. They were incredibly helpful in giving us feedback. And it was actually a company that we acquired two quarters ago, again, small team, not a meaningful bit, but what I think is important there is that the developers of the future are betting their whole companies on workers, Zaraz is not the only example of this. We see more and more companies that are starting with workers as their development platform and the nature of development platforms is that they do create a flywheel where as developers build tools, as they build out an ecosystem that makes it so more and more developers get involved. And so we\u2019re excited about what\u2019s going on with workers. We are continuing to invest in that. And I think that whole team just really thrilled with the adoption that we\u2019re seeing so far. And it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s still early days, but very exciting for both big customers and small.\nMatt Hedberg: That\u2019s really good to hear. I think we\u2019re all excited about what that can do longer term. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, you guys had a great response to the Log4j security incident, I guess. Can you talk about sort of \u2013 could this be a positive demand driver for you all when we look to 2022 and beyond as people sort of understand the importance of your global network?\nMatthew Prince: There are a couple of things about that that were really interesting. The first is, I think it\u2019s sometimes underappreciated the scale of Cloudflare, what effectively is our censor network. And so we were able to, after the Log4j vulnerability was reported, look back across our network, which is comprised of millions and millions of sites with a huge diversity in terms of geography, in terms of size and scale. And we were able to see some of the very first exploits of that. What\u2019s interesting about that is it turned out, in fact, we had the data that was 2 days before anyone else that was out there. And it turned out that we actually caught the researchers themselves testing the vulnerability. And we\u2019re able to see exactly how that was the case. So I think our ability to see what is going on live on the Internet is really the diversity of the traffic gives us visibility into things that just comes earlier and allows us to react faster. And I think the second bit is that because of the way that we have worked with the research community, we\u2019re a very trusted partner in that space. And so we got early warning of the attack and we were able to very quickly react to be able to protect our customers. And I think that, that ability to react quickly is not only a factor of having the information, but then having a programmable platform, which again, Workers\u2019 is at the heart of that allows us to very quickly adapt and roll out a response. And we recognize that this was probably the worst vulnerability to come out in at least the last 5 years. And so we made the call to provide a level of protection even to our free customers because, again, we think that building that goodwill amongst the larger community is the right thing to do. And that was very much recognized by our customers going forward. I think, over the longer term, this is the sort of vulnerability that really is the best evidence of why you need a zero trust platform. And the fact that we\u2019ve got a platform that sees more than anyone else, that is more responsive than anyone else, that is more trusted in the security and research community than anyone else is able to react quickly and have as much goodwill in the community than anyone else, I think, speaks extremely highly of our team, what we\u2019ve built and our ability to continue to execute in the zero trust space. And so, again, I think that these are the sorts of things that add up to winning in this space over time. People know that we\u2019re not just a fly-by-night security company that\u2019s a flash in the pan. They know that we\u2019re a good part and a good steward of the overall Internet ecosystem. And what we hear from customers is they want to invest behind companies like that. And I think that, that\u2019s going to be a real tailwind for our zero trust business.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks, Matt. Well done, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nJames Fish: Hi, guys. Impressive quarter and guidance there. I wanted to go back to Phil\u2019s question actually on Cloudflare for Offices. It was a solution that I think Matthew even highlighted could be a sleeper for \u201822 versus kind of what else got announced during speed in birthday weeks. And really just wanted to ask directly how the adoption and deployment of Cloudflare for Offices has been going and how that tails into kind of overall cloud curve on adoption and getting to that magic core plus solutions you guys like to see per customer?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that the nature of the Office product is that you have to install equipment in buildings around the world. And so right now, we are really focusing on those customers that are for the early examples of people who can use that. Those customers tend to be big Cloudflare adopters already. So a large Fortune 500 technology, consumer technology company using us for a number of other things, wanted us to effectively become their corporate network. We prioritized them in terms of cloud-prefer offices. We\u2019re learning quickly from what their adoption rate is and then we will roll out based on that. A large international Fortune 500 mining company, again, large customer already \u2013 was already running in a lot of their traffic to us with a natural addition for Cloudflare for Offices. So I think what we will do is prioritize and what we have been doing is prioritize those customers where we have existing deployments and use. What\u2019s often the case though is that those customers are sharing some physical space in some of their offices with other customers. And that starts to then create what is the target list or who are the next adopters of Cloudflare for Offices. And so, I think that it will rollout based more on demand and us building toward where customers are asking for it rather than us just deploying equipment and hoping for the best. And I can give that a more sensible way of us doing it. What we have done, though, is secure all the technical infrastructure, both you\u2019re right to be in the building that we think are the most important building and the connectivity to those buildings in order to be able to light up buildings as customers demand it. So I think it\u2019s still a big piece of what\u2019s going on. I think it ties in a lot with our Magic Transit, magic, offering, and then is a great on-ramp for customers that are using our zero trust offering. And I still think it\u2019s going to be kind of one of the underfocused on, but really maybe under-heralded but really important aspects of what we\u2019re building and will deliver in 2022.\nJames Fish: Makes sense. I appreciate that color. And you guys highlighted a lot of large wins this quarter, and it looks like the spending for these large net wins kind of ticked up quite a bit on top of moving into what it sounded like some more Tier 1 kind of verticals like healthcare, telco and financial services that implies really your customer quality actually improved even within the large enterprise base that you guys talked about. And so I\u2019m not sure if this is Thomas or you, Matthew, but how are you guys feeling about this pipeline and extra reach into really the cream of the crop here of Fortune 500 customers in your \u201822 guide?\nMatthew Prince: It\u2019d be interesting to look back over the last four quarters, but I think that, that\u2019s actually been a trend that\u2019s been going on for quite some time in financial services, healthcare, insurance, government, we\u2019ve seen just increased penetration and a real understanding of what Cloudflare is doing. I think that the awareness in the market has ticked up measurably and we\u2019re able to use that. And then the second piece is that as we land with a customer, then we\u2019re able to expand very quickly over time. Based on the broad set of products that we have, I think that our \u2013 we feel really good that a significant percentage of the Fortune 500 will use Cloudflare for something over the course of the next 5 years. What our real important challenges is to make sure that we get those customers to use us for a broad set of our products and platform as possible. And I think that\u2019s actually the bit that really stood out for me this quarter was that we were seeing more and more of our large customers saying, I want a site liaison to be able \u2013 I\u2019ll commit to spending a certain amount with you and we will true it up every year. But we want to be able to really invest behind what that overall platform is. And I don\u2019t want to get tied up in procurement every time you launch a new feature, and I want to add it on.\" I think that\u2019s really exciting. There are very few companies that have the products to be able to get that from their customers. I think that the fact that our customers are pulling us in that direction and asking us for those types of licenses speaks really well for the future of our business.\nThomas Seifert: And Jim, what I would add is that we have always been really well diversified. So, even if you go back to our S1 at the IPO, you could see that the representation across all critical verticals was really, really strong. And even in the quarter, like the fourth quarter, there was no one customer larger than 5% of revenue. What you see is that we are more successful landing new big logos because all the product and feature strength that Matthew mentioned, but that we are able to accelerate revenue with the existing customers in those verticals and that is reflected in our D&R.\nJames Fish: Helpful guys. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter and a great year. I wanted to dig in a little bit to kind of I think what Matthew Hedberg was asking. Any way you could give us sort of more of a sense or sort of a more tangible sense of what the major revenue contributors were to this quarter and sort of to that strength? And to what degree, I mean ideally like a percentage of revenue, what degree is stuff like Cloudflare One and the Workers\u2019 product, significant contributors to that revenue outperformance today versus being kind of the forward avenue of growth, because it sounds like they are really starting to contribute on loss. And then I have a follow-up question for Thomas.\nMatthew Prince: Sure, Keith. So first of all, I think when we talk about Cloudflare One, Cloudflare One is really a collection of a number of our different products. It is saying how can you use not just WAF, not just CDOS, not just CDN, not just our access or gateway products. But how can you use those all together in order to build what is sort of the ideal future corporate network. And so what we see is customers are buying into that vision, and when they ask for using the broader set of our platform. And so I think that what we are excited about is that more and more customers are using the broader set of our platform. That\u2019s great. What we are also equally excited by, there are very few that have fully bought into the entire vision. And that\u2019s something they don\u2019t buy the vision. They actually are super excited about that vision. But it\u2019s just that we keep announcing new products and releasing new things and that gives us the opportunity to sell more to those existing customers. And I think that that\u2019s why you have seen over the course of the last year, our dollar-based net retention continue to tick up is that we have just done a great job at selling more to those \u2013 that existing customer base. I think something like Workers, again, I think it\u2019s hard for us to break out how much of a sale it\u2019s responsible for because it does end up in a bunch of different deals as a way to give us the flexibility and programmability to win those deals. What we are seeing independently is that we are starting to see a real uptick in people who are using sort of just Workers and that they are starting to generate meaningful build just from using the Workers platform itself. But it is still, I think something that we think of as sort of Act 1 was the CDN, WAF, DDoS, DNS, those types of products. Act 2 is our zero trust product, which I think we are square in the middle of and where a lot of our growth is coming from. I think Act 3 is Workers, and that\u2019s still, I don\u2019t think has hit really the hockey stick sort of point in the growth curve.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful, Matthew. I really appreciate that. And then, Thomas, you talked about network CapEx expanding as a percentage of revenues, which is on top of base revenues are obviously growing very fast next year. Can you help us understand how much of that is into like the core kind of network capacity, if you will? And is there a pickup that\u2019s associated with some of the newer initiatives, if you will, like is Offices having an impact there, or R2 going GA, is that having an impact on the level of CapEx?\nThomas Seifert: So, I think the first answer is that if you go back over the last 5 years, we have rather consistently spent about 11% to 12% of revenue for network traffic. So, the new guidance is 12% to 14%, it\u2019s a slight uptick. There is only a modest amount of R2 investment in this number. And you have heard it already from Matthew that the ability of the \u2013 our business model that we can invest behind the demand for I have been talking about this for a while on the go-to-market side, is also true for products like Cloudflare Offices. We don\u2019t invest free in idle capacity and hope that we fill it over time. So, we follow demand expansion with existing customers as you heard Matthew is the first priority. So, there is little investment in this guidance that is ahead of demand that we hope we generate. There is very little at this point in \u2013 for R2 and Offices because we can follow demand. So, it\u2019s more about getting the core capacity to where it needs to be, making sure that we move the network further out closer to the eyeballs we want to connect. And also be thoughtful about some larger strategic customers that are moving business our way that we are prepared for that.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Thank you so much guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Congrats on the ongoing strong performance. Also thanks for the transparency on large customers\u2019 metrics. I was about to ask both Matt Hedberg and Keith question goes from a different direction, but I get the point, Matthew. Maybe from a different perspective, you called out some Workers\u2019 wins and the displacements this quarter. Can you, Matthew, provide us maybe with some more color, who is it that you have been that you are displacing in recent months with that product?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that the \u2013 there are sort of two different directions that, that product displaces. So, the first is for some users, what they use workers for is to make it \u2013 our product is the most configurable version in the world. So, if you want the most configurable firewall or the most configurable DDoS mitigation service or the most configurable DNS service, Workers is a way to extend those services to make them highly programmable and highly configurable. And so I think there are a number of what we would think of as point cloud solution. People who are in the DNS or DDoS or CDN or WAF or firewall space that Workers allows us to help make our platform do exactly what they always dreamed and wished that their platforms could do. And that, I think is especially for larger and larger customers, something that is really just catnip and makes them extremely excited for using us. I think the other place where we see a lot of displacement, which is sort of a different type of use case and probably the one that is more exciting over the long-term, is people who are moving away from other traditional public cloud vendors. What we see is that, first of all, the public cloud is moving from a world where you were effectively renting VM on a box somewhere, and you had to manage the operating system and the software and everything else to what is a much more managed, what is known in the industry as a serverless platform. And I think when you look out, you talk to developers, Workers is one of the serverless platforms that they are the most excited about. And so we see regular wins head-to-head with competing with sort of an AWS Lambda or a Google or a Microsoft cloud function. Those types of services we compete really well on. And we try and compete on all of the different factors that matter performance, obviously, but actually that\u2019s the least important of that, consistency and reliability, which we do a great job because our cold start, we have literally zero millisecond cold start time, the ability for us to be extremely cost effective. And if you do a head-to-head comparison with Workers running the same workload versus the public cloud, we are \u2013 even with the margins that we have, we are extremely cost competitive because it\u2019s a better architecture of how we have designed it. Ease of use, making it really easy. And I think that there has been, over Q4, some really incredible developments and you are going to see more over the coming quarter in us really just making Workers the easiest to use serverless platform that\u2019s out there. And then as Thomas referenced, I think we are increasingly seeing more and more, especially large sophisticated customers because of government and regulatory requirements around data localization and data sovereignty that they need to store and process data locally. And the fact that we can say in more than 100 countries around the world, we can keep your users\u2019 data in their home country, not only to be stored there, but actually process there, that\u2019s something that no other cloud provider can compete with. And so if that\u2019s something that from a regulatory perspective is important to you, those are deals that we are winning more and more. So, we are excited about the adoption of Workers. Again, I think it\u2019s sort of a two-trick pony. It is both really, really good at being able to help us make all of our existing products as configurable as possible, but then it is also extremely good as a true cloud computing platform that developers are building entire businesses on.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. Thank you for the great color. And maybe can you talk about your plans to set up new points of presence in \u201822 as without a debt that we are seeing. The network keeps expanding fairly quickly, so maybe you can quantify how many poops you think about establishing this year?\nMatthew Prince: Shaul, I have to confess, I hate the term pop, because I think it\u2019s \u2013 no normal people know what it means. And it\u2019s not even how we really think about the word. What we are trying to do is directly interconnect with as many networks around the world as possible. And so you can turn up a whole bunch of pops. But if they are not connected to network, they don\u2019t give you any real benefit. So, we have traditionally talked about the cities that we are in, and we continue to expand that. What we have not done because, again, it doesn\u2019t really matter to our customers is break down within those cities, how many individual facilities we are in. What we are in most major cities now is in multiple different facilities. In certain cities now, we will have multiple individual availability zones in order to make sure that we have high degree of availability. But we are continuing to go into more and more networks around the world. And I think that we are on track to be in every U.S. state before the end of the year. I think that we continue to be in the vast majority of major cities with over 2 million people in them, and we continue to invest in getting connected to all of the networks in the world. What\u2019s unique about us is that we continue to have it so that every day, our phone rings with network providers around the world who are inviting us to be directly in their networks. And that\u2019s unique, and it\u2019s unique because of the broad set of services we provide, the broad set of customers that we have. And I think that, that is part of what explains how we have been able to achieve and maintain and actually improve on our gross margins even as our traffic rates have continued to increase. And that\u2019s really differentiated from anyone else in the space.\nShaul Eyal: Sure. Matthew, thank you so much. Keep up the great job.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. I am just going to ask one question. Matthew, you gave the example of the Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company network security win worth about $750,000. When I think about the Fortune 500 company, I usually think about them spending tens of millions of dollars on firewalls, for example. So, what I am wondering is, is the opportunity when you go in and replace those physical appliance, is that a fraction of the spend that those customers need to make, or are you just so early that this is just a very tiny beginning in terms of that opportunity with a customer like that?\nMatthew Prince: I think we are super early. I think that we are going to continue to be able \u2013 what we have seen with customers is that we typically win with deals and then are able to expand them over time as they adopt more and more of our platform. We don\u2019t ask people \u2013 one of Thomas\u2019 favorite points to remind me to bring up is that we are not a rip-and-replace solution. We are happy to go in and put ourselves in the mix with other firewall vendors and be very complementary to them over time or load balancers or WAN optimizer whatever it is. And what often will happen is a customer will say to us, \u201cListen, our existing network is working okay for us, but we have got this far flung office that we need to take care of. We are worried about contractors and we want to keep them separate from the rest of our network. Maybe you can help us with that.\u201d What then tends to happen is they have such a good experience with that, that they see that as replacement time is coming up on their hardware equipment that they say, \u201cWell, maybe we can just replace that with Cloudflare.\u201d And over time, we win that war of attrition. I think there were really two kind of head fakes for the hardware business over the last 4 years. One was the tax cut that really incentivized moving forward CapEx spend and probably kind of artificially buoyed some of the hardware manufacturers that are out there. And the second was really COVID, where people weren\u2019t \u2013 they may have planned on moving to a zero trust architecture, moving to a cloud architecture, but when COVID hit, they were like all bets were off, buy just more of whatever I have right now. And I think that, that was a little bit of a head fake for some of the hardware space. What we are seeing though is that as people are coming out, as IT organizations are seeing sort of a light at the end of the COVID tunnel, they are saying, now it\u2019s time for us to go back and actually invest in what we think of as the long-term architecture. And increasingly, what we hear from the largest customers in the world and industry analysts is that what it is that we are building is that future of the corporate network. And I think more and more customers are going to continue to expand over time and including that pharmaceutical company.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nJayson Noland: Emma, can we take one more analyst, please?\nOperator: Excellent. Your last question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani. Your line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess also one question as well. Last quarter, there was a fair bit of talk around the R2 offering, which it sounds like you are going to get ready for GSI. Can you just talk about what has the customer feedback been for R2 in the last 90 days? And I think since you started talking about it, AWS would lower their previous amount. It confuses that change that is in your perspective as well.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Well, actually, I didn\u2019t \u2013 or their egress speaks all that much, but I am flattered that they are paying attention. And I think they have a long way to go in order to catch up with the rest of the industry. I think the leaders in this space actually have been folks like Oracle and Google, who have said that they will have much more dramatic egress lowering. And I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before AWS will follow that as well. And if we can be a part of catalyzing that for the industry, I think that that\u2019s a huge win. What we have heard though from the feedback on R2 has been terrific. So, we have been running it in a private beta. We have had customers on board. They have given great feedback on the places that it\u2019s working extremely well. What we are optimizing right now is just making sure that we have exactly the same performance characteristics that we would expect and that customers expect from S3. And we think that architecturally we will be able to meet or beat that over time. We are excited by our ability to deliver this. I am looking forward to the day that I can share the logos of who, talking about bringing data over, but we have hundreds of petabytes of data that we are confident will, as R2 goes GA be able to move over to our platform. And I think that again, it\u2019s exciting for the revenue that, that will generate. But what I think is really exciting for us is two other things that it really will help catalyze our overall Cloudflare Workers growth and it becomes a fundamental component of that computing platform. But that then secondly, that it\u2019s going to help unlock the cloud, because I think that other cloud providers will have to respond to this and it is a win for the entire industry if we are able to drive what are done these egregious egress fees down. And what we want to make sure is that customers can choose products based on whoever is the best out there, and we are confident that we have got a platform that can win on the performance, security, reliability and cost side. And that\u2019s \u2013 I think I am excited for how we are positioned to be delivering on our value proposition going forward. And our entire team, I am proud of for what they have built and that we got AWS to blink a little is something that I think is good for the entire industry.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks a lot for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you so much to everyone for tuning in to the earnings call. As I said at the beginning, it has been a most excellent quarter for us. There is a ton of hard work that goes in behind the scenes to not just get ready for these earnings calls, but more importantly, service our customers, build great products and deliver on the value of our mission, which is to help build a better Internet. And so I just wanted to thank everyone of our customers, every one of our investors, and most importantly, every one of our employees for what was an incredible Q4 and an incredible year. We are already hard at work in 2022, and we look forward to tuning in to give you the updates on what we did in Q1. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew and thank you to everyone for joining us. We delivered another excellent quarter and wrapped up an incredible year. In 2021, we achieved multiple records and milestones and ended the year, with accelerated revenue growth. Large customer additions continue to outpace top line revenue growth and we achieved a record 125% dollar-based net retention rate in the fourth quarter. We continue to deliver over 50% compound annual growth rate on revenue since 2016 and remained profitable since the third quarter. These achievements reinforce our track record of delivering strong revenue growth at scale with increasingly strong unit economics, benefiting from the inherent strength of our business. Turning to revenue, total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 54% year-over-year to $193.6 million. The growth in revenue was driven by another quarter of strong customer demand both in terms of new local acquisitions as well as expansion within our existing customer base. We ended the fiscal year with revenue of $656.4 million, representing an increase of 52% year-over-year. As I just mentioned, this makes it our fifth year of delivering at least 50% compound annual growth rate on revenue since 2016, a testament to the consistency and durability of our business model. From a geographic perspective in Q4, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 52% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 60% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 29% year-over-year. We are pleased to see growth accelerate in APAC and see EMEA repeat as our highest growth geography. EMEA continues to benefit from a number of data localization suite wins driven by the increasing focus on GDPR and data privacy regulations. Turning to our customer metrics, we exited the quarter with 140,096 paying customers, representing an increase of 26% year-over-year. We ended the year with 1,416 large customers, representing an increase of 71% year-over-year. We added 156 large customers in the quarter and 588 large customers in the fiscal year. We are also providing an annual update on a few key large customer metrics, including large customer revenue contributions. Our large customers have not only grown in numbers, but also the average spend with us, causing their revenue contribution to continue to climb through the year. For fiscal 2021, large customers represented 54% of total revenue compared to 46% of total revenue in 2020. For the full year, we are also breaking out our large customers into cohorts of those with spend greater than $500,000 and $1 million. We ended the year with 121 customers that spend over $500,000 with us, a 70% increase year-over-year. We ended the year with 56 customers that spend over $1 million with us, a 75% increase year-over-year. The significant expansion from our large customers contributed to a record dollar-based net retention rate of 125%, representing an increase of 100 basis points sequentially. We continue to see broad-based strength across our customer base and robust traction and growth in our large customer cohorts, which continues to outpace top line revenue growth. Gross retention remains over 90% and customer expansion continues to be fueled by compelling unit economics and increasingly favorable customer acquisition cost. We will keep investing heavily in building our enterprise portfolio in developing a world class go-to-market strategy to position us for the massive opportunity ahead. Moving to gross margin, fourth quarter gross margin was 79.2% consistent with last quarter. Network CapEx represented 10% of revenue in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we added roughly 29,000 paying customers, representing an increase of 26% year-over-year. Traffic volumes have also increased significantly. In the fourth quarter, traffic volumes grew by 88% compared to the same quarter last year. Despite these significant increases, we were able to maintain network CapEx as a percentage of revenue at 11% and a high gross margin of 78.6% for fiscal 2021. This underscores the resiliency of our network and our ability to use gross margin as a strategic weapon to gain market share. Going forward, we plan to accelerate investments in our global network and expect network CapEx to be 12% to 14% of revenue for fiscal 2022. Turning to operating expenses, fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and decreased 4% year-over-year to 78%. We had another strong hiring quarter, where we saw our total number of employees increased 36% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to approximately 2,440 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $86 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially, decreased to 44% from 46% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $37 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue stayed flat sequentially and decreased to 19% from 20% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $28 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue stayed flat sequentially and decreased to 14% from 16% in the same quarter last year. We saw continued operating leverage in the fourth quarter with operating margins improving 550 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was $2.2 million compared to an operating loss of $5.5 million in the same period last year. Q4 was our second consecutive quarter of achieving operating profit. And as a reminder, we intend to grow our operating expenses in line with revenue, stay near or at breakeven and reinvest excess profitability back into the business to address the enormous opportunity in front of us. Turning to net income and the balance sheet, our net income in the quarter was $131,000 or net income per share of $0.00. Tax expenses for the fourth quarter, was $1.9 million. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $8.6 million or 4% of revenue compared to negative $23.5 million or 19% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was $40.6 million in the fourth quarter or 21% of revenue. This represented an increase of $47.5 million sequentially and an increase of $49.4 million year-over-year, helped by strong cash collection and growth of new and existing business. We are very pleased to have achieved our first free cash flow positive quarter as a public company. Going forward, we expect to see some variability in the first half of 2022 as we continue to invest in building refurbishments and network capacity, but we do expect to return to positive free cash flow in the second half of 2022. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $624 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially and 63% year-over-year. Current RPO was 77% of total RPO. The strength we saw in the fourth quarter across top line, bottom line and RPO in combination with our rate of innovation that allows us to continuously expand TAM gives us confidence and visibility heading into the new year. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $205 million to $206 million, representing an increase of 48% to 49% year-over-year. We expect operating income to be in the range of $500,000 to $1.5 million, and we expect a net income per share of zero to $0.01, assuming approximately 348 million common shares outstanding. We expect tax expense of $1.7 million. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $927 million to $931 million, representing an increase of 41% to 42% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $10 million to $14 million, and we expect net income per share over that period in the range of $0.03 to $0.04, assuming approximately 352 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $8 million. In closing, it has been a remarkable year for Cloudflare as we finish our second full year as a publicly traded company. I would like to thank our customers, partners and the community for their endless trust and support in us. And I want to thank all Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication to innovate and deliver in serving our customers and global community. We've built a culture of relentless innovation, powerful platform and the successful go-to-market strategy grounded by an exceptionally efficient and durable business model. This positions Cloudflare at the forefront of a tremendous opportunity as the corporate network transitions to the cloud and develop a lineup to build on our edge. In 2022, we will continue to invest in innovative new products and expand our total addressable market by turning point solutions into features of our global network. I'm extremely proud of what we have accomplished, and I'm excited for this year. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Very optimistic. So we've seen that despite the growth we have seen over the last couple of years, and despite the fact that we successfully moved up the enterprise stack to larger and larger customers with larger and larger ATBs that we've been able, not only to keep the productivity of the quota-carrying employees, but also the ramp curve getting them to put productivity has not changed. And our average sales cycle still continues to be on the 90 days. So that's \u2013 when we talk about the durability and the consistency of the business model, that's one of the impressive vectors that we've been able to keep those productivity levels despite the fact that the go-to-market motion has successfully migrated to larger and larger accounts. And Jim, what I would add is that we have always been really well diversified. So, even if you go back to our S1 at the IPO, you could see that the representation across all critical verticals was really, really strong. And even in the quarter, like the fourth quarter, there was no one customer larger than 5% of revenue. What you see is that we are more successful landing new big logos because all the product and feature strength that Matthew mentioned, but that we are able to accelerate revenue with the existing customers in those verticals and that is reflected in our D&R. So, I think the first answer is that if you go back over the last 5 years, we have rather consistently spent about 11% to 12% of revenue for network traffic. So, the new guidance is 12% to 14%, it's a slight uptick. There is only a modest amount of R2 investment in this number. And you have heard it already from Matthew that the ability of the \u2013 our business model that we can invest behind the demand for I have been talking about this for a while on the go-to-market side, is also true for products like Cloudflare Offices. We don't invest free in idle capacity and hope that we fill it over time. So, we follow demand expansion with existing customers as you heard Matthew is the first priority. So, there is little investment in this guidance that is ahead of demand that we hope we generate. There is very little at this point in \u2013 for R2 and Offices because we can follow demand. So, it's more about getting the core capacity to where it needs to be, making sure that we move the network further out closer to the eyeballs we want to connect. And also be thoughtful about some larger strategic customers that are moving business our way that we are prepared for that."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Jayson. In the immortal words of Bill and Ted, we had a most excellent quarter. In Q4, we achieved revenue of $194 million, up 54% year-over-year. We added 156 new large customers, those that spend more than $100,000 a year with us, ending the year with 1,416 large customers, up 71% year-over-year. Our dollar-based net retention ticked up to a record 125%, improving 6 percentage points from a year ago. For the full year, we earned $656 million, up 52% year-over-year. 2021 becomes our fifth straight year with 50% or greater compounded growth. I am proud of two things. First, over those 5 years, our growth has actually accelerated; but second, and probably more important, our growth has been relentlessly consistent. We have dialed in our business. We understand and we are in control of its levers. You can see that in metrics like our gross margin. While talk across the industry is about increasing cost and pricing pressure, we achieved a gross margin of 79%. That remains above our long-term target gross margin range of 75% to 77% and creates some opportunities. We expect to use this exceptional gross margin as a weapon to take business from competitors more vulnerable than we are to pricing and cost pressures. It also allows us to bundle together products into an overall platform no competitor can match. In Q3, we had our first quarter as a public company with positive operating margins. This is our second. It won't be our last. That said, as I talked about last quarter, we are not in a rush to be significantly profitable. Over the years, our team is asking about profitability. The story I told them was to imagine every year you saw your neighbor shoveling money into a machine. A year later, a lot more money came out. Year after year, the money kept piling up and getting shoveled back in. If, one year, you look at your window and didn't see your neighbor shoveling all the money back into the machine you would worry, what's wrong with the machine? To be clear, there is nothing wrong with our machine. We will continue to shovel money back in to drive innovation and reach new customers as long as we can achieve exceptional growth. We think of managing our operating margin a bit like that game Flappy Bird, not too high, not too low, for as long as we can, we want our operating margin to hold just above breakeven and right where it's been for the last two quarters. In other words, we have done something wrong if we beat significantly on EPS. Cash flow, on the other hand, nobody is going to complain if there is more cash in your bank account at the end of the quarter than there was at the beginning. We are proud that this is Cloudflare's first quarter since we have been public to be free cash flow positive. It also won't be our last. We know this is a business that can generate significant cash flows when we want. In the short-term, we expect we will see negative cash flows for the next two quarters as we invest in our network and redesign our physical offices for a post-COVID world. But by the second half of the year, we forecast we will be free cash flow positive. We admire and seek to emulate other companies that came before us and had significant cash flows while holding operating margins at breakeven. And we feel very dialed in and confident in our business as we come out of the uncertainty over the last 2 years. So, what's our secret? It's not one thing, it's many. It starts with innovation. When we talk to customers, what they appreciate about Cloudflare is our relentless innovation. It expands our market and ensures that customers can use us to be the complete future of their corporate network. But beyond new products, we leverage economies of scale and network effects to drive our business and innovate more efficiencies. Yes, the supply chain has gotten harder, but we have leveraged our relationships, hyper-efficient procurement team and fully software-defined network to keep driving our costs down. Network effects are spawned by networks and we have run one of the largest networks in the world. As customers join our network, our network gets better and more efficient. If you want to understand how we have been able to continue to drive our business at this rate, this virtual cycle is where to look. And because it's a flywheel, this efficiency allows us to continue to invest in products. Our team love launching new products and we are planning at least 7 innovation weeks full of new products in 2022, further extending our network, introducing new capabilities and growing our TAM. The products we announced in 2021 are already thriving. For example, we had over 200,000 domains sign-up for our e-mail routing service and seemingly overnight to become a major e-mail security provider. R2, our zero egress office store, has had more than 9,000 sign-ups for its closed beta, including some incredible logos. It represents hundreds of petabytes of storage and demonstrates the palpable excitement around our workers' developer platform. We are on track for R2 to progress to open beta in Q2 and then be generally available in the second half of 2022. While our bias is toward internal product development, we will make strategic acquisitions when we find teams and products that can complement what we have built. I am excited to announce today that we have acquired Vectrix, a startup that has built the easiest to use, most powerful CASB we have seen. CASBs, cloud access security brokers, are a category of services that give visibility and control over data stored in SaaS applications. They can be powerful tools, but their Achilles' heel has always been their complex setup. The Vectrix team impressed us with how quickly they could onboard any new customer regardless of size and instantly gives them visibility into all the service providers where the customers' data was stored. As such, their product is a natural add-on to every current Cloudflare customer. They remind me of Cloudflare and our philosophy since our earliest days. The Vectrix team and technology further rounds out our Zero Trust platform, giving visibility not only for data flowing across the network, but now also data at rest in service providers. We believe it makes Cloudflare Zero Trust a no-brainer, comprehensive security solution for any company and we are thrilled to have the Vectrix team onboard. Let me highlight some great wins we have at Zero Trust and other products over the quarter. A global Fortune 500 telecommunications company signed a $1 million annual contract for over 100,000 Zero Trust seats. This customer initially started on a self-service plan with fewer than 500 seats 2 years ago. This win shows how the ease of use of our service and ability to land customers with individual teams within organizations can efficiently turn them into major customers over time. A Fortune 500 media company signed a $250,000 annual contract for more than 10,000 Zero Trust seats. It was a competitive deal, but ultimately, they selected us for being the most flexible and innovative solution on the market. What's great about wins like these is that there is an opportunity for us to expand the customers across our entire platform. You earn your place as a platform one feature at a time. Customers often work with us to solve a problem and then over time, give us a chance to compete for more of their business. And we saw exactly that with other customers this quarter. For instance, a Fortune 500 financial services company expanded their use of our platform by signing a $900,000 3-year expansion deal, bringing their annual contract value to over $1.5 million. They described us as \u201cfuture proof.\u201d It's an example of us bundling our platform to give them access to a broad set of our features while minimizing procurement friction. A Fortune 1000 shipping and logistics company signed a similar platform bundled deal, which more than doubles their 3-year contract value to $3 million. They specifically appreciated how Cloudflare was a single vendor they could turn to, to deliver the future of their corporate network. A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company signed a $750,000 3-year deal for network securities. It continues to be true that as companies migrate their on-premise hardware solutions, they continue to turn to Cloudflare to build the future of their networks. And as we come out the other side of COVID, we are seeing more and more companies rethink their network design and moving to the cloud and away from on-premise boxes. A Fortune 500 retailer moved away from two competitors in order to take advantage of Cloudflare Workers. While the competitors have promised similar functionality, they found it simply didn't work as promised. They signed a 3-year $1.2 million contract. Our Workers platform, which has been in production now for 4.5 years, continues to extend its lead with developers. And you didn't have to be a Fortune 500 company to sign a big deal with us this quarter. One of the most innovative payment startups signed a 3-year $1.5 million contract for our network security products. They appreciate Cloudflare Workers and the flexibility it provided them to service a broad set of merchants worldwide. Finally, in our business, we need to stay on top of cybersecurity issues globally. We are therefore watching the situation in Ukraine closely. Modern warfare increasingly includes the cyber battlefield. While they don't generate meaningful revenue, we have onboarded a number of Ukrainian businesses, news outlets and government organizations in anticipation of potential attacks. While we hope the current tensions will resolve peacefully, we have experienced mitigating nations-based cyberattacks and we are prepared to defend our customers and network whatever may come. Before I turn it over to Thomas, I wanted to thank the entire Cloudflare team for all your hard work and dedication. It was a most outstanding quarter and a most outstanding year. I am excited for what we are going to achieve together in 2022. And with that, Thomas, take it away. Yes, Phil, thanks for the question. We are always looking at our network and asking ourselves how can we make it faster? How can we make it more reliable? And how can we make it more efficient. And I think the backbone is one of the things that checks all three of those boxes. We have enough traffic across our network, that it is now more efficient for us, meaning it is less expensive for us to run over our own private connections than it is over the public Internet in many cases. On top of that, every time you add another provider, and especially when you add a provider you have complete control over, that allows you to optimize for the performance and reliability. And with our own backbone, because we sit at both sides of that, we can actually do things that you can't do over the public Internet. We can support larger packet sizes. We can actually support protocols that aren't supported across the standard Internet. And that allows us to really live up to our mission of helping build what is literally a better Internet and give our customers an experience they can't find anywhere else. In terms of Cloudflare for Offices, what we have heard from our customers is that as they want to take advantage of all of our different services, they want to be able to plug in to us as easily as possible. And so we are trying to offer on-ramps to them to be able to get on to our network and take advantage of our zero trust offering, make sure that their offices are protected from attack and make that as easy as just plugging in a patch cable. One of the things that we saw in the second half of 2021 was a real increase in cyber attacks directed directly at the network offices. It used to be once upon a time that DDoS attacks only went after, for example, your corporate marketing website. Now that more and more people are relying on virtual desktops or relying on zero trust network initiatives, attackers are smart to that and know that they can cause more harm. And therefore, extract larger ransoms by going after the networks themselves. If we can make it so that you as a \u2013 one of our customers, really never touches the public Internet, you go straight from your office and router there to ours, that isolates you from attackers. And so we think that, that's something that is extremely attractive, again, at checking all those boxes. Being more cost effective for us to run being more reliable, being more performant and in addition to that, really being more secure. So I think those things all line up. And again, I think we've seen, especially with Cloudflare for Offices, early success in terms of adoption, and it's somewhere that we continue to invest, and we're very excited about. Matt, we're extremely excited about how workers is being adopted across our customer base. We still see that north of 20% of new enterprise deals include workers at some level. But I think what's even more exciting is that as we go down market and look at individual developers because the people who actually have their hands on keyboards are who are the most important, we see an enormous amount of excitement there. So a couple of different things. I think that this is the year that we will have through a critical milestone of developers, which is how do you get to 1 million developers that are using the Workers' platform. We see a clear path to that over the course of 2022. And I think that, that's going to be a really exciting milestone for us. I think the other piece is that we are starting to see companies that are being built entirely on workers. And so there was actually a startup company called Zaraz, which was built entirely using workers to optimize the marketing stack and build a much more secure, much more performance and much more privacy-friendly sort of marketing, whether that's pixels or tags that are on pages still that in a way that was much more friendly, we met that team. They worked with us closely. They were incredibly helpful in giving us feedback. And it was actually a company that we acquired two quarters ago, again, small team, not a meaningful bit, but what I think is important there is that the developers of the future are betting their whole companies on workers, Zaraz is not the only example of this. We see more and more companies that are starting with workers as their development platform and the nature of development platforms is that they do create a flywheel where as developers build tools, as they build out an ecosystem that makes it so more and more developers get involved. And so we're excited about what's going on with workers. We are continuing to invest in that. And I think that whole team just really thrilled with the adoption that we're seeing so far. And it's \u2013 I think it's still early days, but very exciting for both big customers and small. There are a couple of things about that that were really interesting. The first is, I think it's sometimes underappreciated the scale of Cloudflare, what effectively is our censor network. And so we were able to, after the Log4j vulnerability was reported, look back across our network, which is comprised of millions and millions of sites with a huge diversity in terms of geography, in terms of size and scale. And we were able to see some of the very first exploits of that. What's interesting about that is it turned out, in fact, we had the data that was 2 days before anyone else that was out there. And it turned out that we actually caught the researchers themselves testing the vulnerability. And we're able to see exactly how that was the case. So I think our ability to see what is going on live on the Internet is really the diversity of the traffic gives us visibility into things that just comes earlier and allows us to react faster. And I think the second bit is that because of the way that we have worked with the research community, we're a very trusted partner in that space. And so we got early warning of the attack and we were able to very quickly react to be able to protect our customers. And I think that, that ability to react quickly is not only a factor of having the information, but then having a programmable platform, which again, Workers' is at the heart of that allows us to very quickly adapt and roll out a response. And we recognize that this was probably the worst vulnerability to come out in at least the last 5 years. And so we made the call to provide a level of protection even to our free customers because, again, we think that building that goodwill amongst the larger community is the right thing to do. And that was very much recognized by our customers going forward. I think, over the longer term, this is the sort of vulnerability that really is the best evidence of why you need a zero trust platform. And the fact that we've got a platform that sees more than anyone else, that is more responsive than anyone else, that is more trusted in the security and research community than anyone else is able to react quickly and have as much goodwill in the community than anyone else, I think, speaks extremely highly of our team, what we've built and our ability to continue to execute in the zero trust space. And so, again, I think that these are the sorts of things that add up to winning in this space over time. People know that we're not just a fly-by-night security company that's a flash in the pan. They know that we're a good part and a good steward of the overall Internet ecosystem. And what we hear from customers is they want to invest behind companies like that. And I think that, that's going to be a real tailwind for our zero trust business. Yes. I think that the nature of the Office product is that you have to install equipment in buildings around the world. And so right now, we are really focusing on those customers that are for the early examples of people who can use that. Those customers tend to be big Cloudflare adopters already. So a large Fortune 500 technology, consumer technology company using us for a number of other things, wanted us to effectively become their corporate network. We prioritized them in terms of cloud-prefer offices. We're learning quickly from what their adoption rate is and then we will roll out based on that. A large international Fortune 500 mining company, again, large customer already \u2013 was already running in a lot of their traffic to us with a natural addition for Cloudflare for Offices. So I think what we will do is prioritize and what we have been doing is prioritize those customers where we have existing deployments and use. What's often the case though is that those customers are sharing some physical space in some of their offices with other customers. And that starts to then create what is the target list or who are the next adopters of Cloudflare for Offices. And so, I think that it will rollout based more on demand and us building toward where customers are asking for it rather than us just deploying equipment and hoping for the best. And I can give that a more sensible way of us doing it. What we have done, though, is secure all the technical infrastructure, both you're right to be in the building that we think are the most important building and the connectivity to those buildings in order to be able to light up buildings as customers demand it. So I think it's still a big piece of what's going on. I think it ties in a lot with our Magic Transit, magic, offering, and then is a great on-ramp for customers that are using our zero trust offering. And I still think it's going to be kind of one of the underfocused on, but really maybe under-heralded but really important aspects of what we're building and will deliver in 2022. It'd be interesting to look back over the last four quarters, but I think that, that's actually been a trend that's been going on for quite some time in financial services, healthcare, insurance, government, we've seen just increased penetration and a real understanding of what Cloudflare is doing. I think that the awareness in the market has ticked up measurably and we're able to use that. And then the second piece is that as we land with a customer, then we're able to expand very quickly over time. Based on the broad set of products that we have, I think that our \u2013 we feel really good that a significant percentage of the Fortune 500 will use Cloudflare for something over the course of the next 5 years. What our real important challenges is to make sure that we get those customers to use us for a broad set of our products and platform as possible. And I think that's actually the bit that really stood out for me this quarter was that we were seeing more and more of our large customers saying, I want a site liaison to be able \u2013 I'll commit to spending a certain amount with you and we will true it up every year. But we want to be able to really invest behind what that overall platform is. And I don't want to get tied up in procurement every time you launch a new feature, and I want to add it on.\" I think that's really exciting. There are very few companies that have the products to be able to get that from their customers. I think that the fact that our customers are pulling us in that direction and asking us for those types of licenses speaks really well for the future of our business. Sure, Keith. So first of all, I think when we talk about Cloudflare One, Cloudflare One is really a collection of a number of our different products. It is saying how can you use not just WAF, not just CDOS, not just CDN, not just our access or gateway products. But how can you use those all together in order to build what is sort of the ideal future corporate network. And so what we see is customers are buying into that vision, and when they ask for using the broader set of our platform. And so I think that what we are excited about is that more and more customers are using the broader set of our platform. That's great. What we are also equally excited by, there are very few that have fully bought into the entire vision. And that's something they don't buy the vision. They actually are super excited about that vision. But it's just that we keep announcing new products and releasing new things and that gives us the opportunity to sell more to those existing customers. And I think that that's why you have seen over the course of the last year, our dollar-based net retention continue to tick up is that we have just done a great job at selling more to those \u2013 that existing customer base. I think something like Workers, again, I think it's hard for us to break out how much of a sale it's responsible for because it does end up in a bunch of different deals as a way to give us the flexibility and programmability to win those deals. What we are seeing independently is that we are starting to see a real uptick in people who are using sort of just Workers and that they are starting to generate meaningful build just from using the Workers platform itself. But it is still, I think something that we think of as sort of Act 1 was the CDN, WAF, DDoS, DNS, those types of products. Act 2 is our zero trust product, which I think we are square in the middle of and where a lot of our growth is coming from. I think Act 3 is Workers, and that's still, I don't think has hit really the hockey stick sort of point in the growth curve. Yes. I think that the \u2013 there are sort of two different directions that, that product displaces. So, the first is for some users, what they use workers for is to make it \u2013 our product is the most configurable version in the world. So, if you want the most configurable firewall or the most configurable DDoS mitigation service or the most configurable DNS service, Workers is a way to extend those services to make them highly programmable and highly configurable. And so I think there are a number of what we would think of as point cloud solution. People who are in the DNS or DDoS or CDN or WAF or firewall space that Workers allows us to help make our platform do exactly what they always dreamed and wished that their platforms could do. And that, I think is especially for larger and larger customers, something that is really just catnip and makes them extremely excited for using us. I think the other place where we see a lot of displacement, which is sort of a different type of use case and probably the one that is more exciting over the long-term, is people who are moving away from other traditional public cloud vendors. What we see is that, first of all, the public cloud is moving from a world where you were effectively renting VM on a box somewhere, and you had to manage the operating system and the software and everything else to what is a much more managed, what is known in the industry as a serverless platform. And I think when you look out, you talk to developers, Workers is one of the serverless platforms that they are the most excited about. And so we see regular wins head-to-head with competing with sort of an AWS Lambda or a Google or a Microsoft cloud function. Those types of services we compete really well on. And we try and compete on all of the different factors that matter performance, obviously, but actually that's the least important of that, consistency and reliability, which we do a great job because our cold start, we have literally zero millisecond cold start time, the ability for us to be extremely cost effective. And if you do a head-to-head comparison with Workers running the same workload versus the public cloud, we are \u2013 even with the margins that we have, we are extremely cost competitive because it's a better architecture of how we have designed it. Ease of use, making it really easy. And I think that there has been, over Q4, some really incredible developments and you are going to see more over the coming quarter in us really just making Workers the easiest to use serverless platform that's out there. And then as Thomas referenced, I think we are increasingly seeing more and more, especially large sophisticated customers because of government and regulatory requirements around data localization and data sovereignty that they need to store and process data locally. And the fact that we can say in more than 100 countries around the world, we can keep your users' data in their home country, not only to be stored there, but actually process there, that's something that no other cloud provider can compete with. And so if that's something that from a regulatory perspective is important to you, those are deals that we are winning more and more. So, we are excited about the adoption of Workers. Again, I think it's sort of a two-trick pony. It is both really, really good at being able to help us make all of our existing products as configurable as possible, but then it is also extremely good as a true cloud computing platform that developers are building entire businesses on. Shaul, I have to confess, I hate the term pop, because I think it's \u2013 no normal people know what it means. And it's not even how we really think about the word. What we are trying to do is directly interconnect with as many networks around the world as possible. And so you can turn up a whole bunch of pops. But if they are not connected to network, they don't give you any real benefit. So, we have traditionally talked about the cities that we are in, and we continue to expand that. What we have not done because, again, it doesn't really matter to our customers is break down within those cities, how many individual facilities we are in. What we are in most major cities now is in multiple different facilities. In certain cities now, we will have multiple individual availability zones in order to make sure that we have high degree of availability. But we are continuing to go into more and more networks around the world. And I think that we are on track to be in every U.S. state before the end of the year. I think that we continue to be in the vast majority of major cities with over 2 million people in them, and we continue to invest in getting connected to all of the networks in the world. What's unique about us is that we continue to have it so that every day, our phone rings with network providers around the world who are inviting us to be directly in their networks. And that's unique, and it's unique because of the broad set of services we provide, the broad set of customers that we have. And I think that, that is part of what explains how we have been able to achieve and maintain and actually improve on our gross margins even as our traffic rates have continued to increase. And that's really differentiated from anyone else in the space. Thank you. I think we are super early. I think that we are going to continue to be able \u2013 what we have seen with customers is that we typically win with deals and then are able to expand them over time as they adopt more and more of our platform. We don't ask people \u2013 one of Thomas' favorite points to remind me to bring up is that we are not a rip-and-replace solution. We are happy to go in and put ourselves in the mix with other firewall vendors and be very complementary to them over time or load balancers or WAN optimizer whatever it is. And what often will happen is a customer will say to us, \u201cListen, our existing network is working okay for us, but we have got this far flung office that we need to take care of. We are worried about contractors and we want to keep them separate from the rest of our network. Maybe you can help us with that.\u201d What then tends to happen is they have such a good experience with that, that they see that as replacement time is coming up on their hardware equipment that they say, \u201cWell, maybe we can just replace that with Cloudflare.\u201d And over time, we win that war of attrition. I think there were really two kind of head fakes for the hardware business over the last 4 years. One was the tax cut that really incentivized moving forward CapEx spend and probably kind of artificially buoyed some of the hardware manufacturers that are out there. And the second was really COVID, where people weren't \u2013 they may have planned on moving to a zero trust architecture, moving to a cloud architecture, but when COVID hit, they were like all bets were off, buy just more of whatever I have right now. And I think that, that was a little bit of a head fake for some of the hardware space. What we are seeing though is that as people are coming out, as IT organizations are seeing sort of a light at the end of the COVID tunnel, they are saying, now it's time for us to go back and actually invest in what we think of as the long-term architecture. And increasingly, what we hear from the largest customers in the world and industry analysts is that what it is that we are building is that future of the corporate network. And I think more and more customers are going to continue to expand over time and including that pharmaceutical company. Yes. Well, actually, I didn't \u2013 or their egress speaks all that much, but I am flattered that they are paying attention. And I think they have a long way to go in order to catch up with the rest of the industry. I think the leaders in this space actually have been folks like Oracle and Google, who have said that they will have much more dramatic egress lowering. And I think it's only a matter of time before AWS will follow that as well. And if we can be a part of catalyzing that for the industry, I think that that's a huge win. What we have heard though from the feedback on R2 has been terrific. So, we have been running it in a private beta. We have had customers on board. They have given great feedback on the places that it's working extremely well. What we are optimizing right now is just making sure that we have exactly the same performance characteristics that we would expect and that customers expect from S3. And we think that architecturally we will be able to meet or beat that over time. We are excited by our ability to deliver this. I am looking forward to the day that I can share the logos of who, talking about bringing data over, but we have hundreds of petabytes of data that we are confident will, as R2 goes GA be able to move over to our platform. And I think that again, it's exciting for the revenue that, that will generate. But what I think is really exciting for us is two other things that it really will help catalyze our overall Cloudflare Workers growth and it becomes a fundamental component of that computing platform. But that then secondly, that it's going to help unlock the cloud, because I think that other cloud providers will have to respond to this and it is a win for the entire industry if we are able to drive what are done these egregious egress fees down. And what we want to make sure is that customers can choose products based on whoever is the best out there, and we are confident that we have got a platform that can win on the performance, security, reliability and cost side. And that's \u2013 I think I am excited for how we are positioned to be delivering on our value proposition going forward. And our entire team, I am proud of for what they have built and that we got AWS to blink a little is something that I think is good for the entire industry. Thank you so much to everyone for tuning in to the earnings call. As I said at the beginning, it has been a most excellent quarter for us. There is a ton of hard work that goes in behind the scenes to not just get ready for these earnings calls, but more importantly, service our customers, build great products and deliver on the value of our mission, which is to help build a better Internet. And so I just wanted to thank everyone of our customers, every one of our investors, and most importantly, every one of our employees for what was an incredible Q4 and an incredible year. We are already hard at work in 2022, and we look forward to tuning in to give you the updates on what we did in Q1. Thank you so much."

We would also like to inform you that we'll be participating in the Jefferies Cybersecurity Summit on November 10, the RBC Capital Markets TIMT Conference on November 16, at Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 1 and the Wells Fargo TMT Summit on December 2. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jayson. We had a landmark quarter. In Q3, we achieved revenue of $172 million, up 51% year-over-year. We continue to see particular strength across our large customer segment, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, and ended the quarter with 1,260 large customers, up 16% quarter-over-quarter and 71% year-over-year. Our average contracted customer now spends over $100,000 annually with us, up from an average of $72,000 when we went public just over two years ago, evidencing our success selling to larger and larger enterprises. Our dollar-based net retention remained strong at 124%, and we achieved a record gross margin of over 79% in the quarter. It was also a milestone quarter because we reached profitability, delivering a positive operating margin and EPS. When we went public, we anticipated we'd reach breakeven in the second half of 2022. At our Investor Day earlier this year, we updated that forecast to Q1 of 2022, but our continued strong growth and relentless efficiency allowed us to reach this milestone even earlier. While we are proud to be profitable, I want to repeat what I said in our earnings call last quarter. We have a long-term operating margin target of 20%. We remain confident in our ability to reach that long-term target, but we are not in a rush to get there. When we say long term, we really mean it. As long as we can achieve extraordinary growth, we anticipate that we will pour our profits back into our research and development and sales and marketing machine. We are nowhere close to being out of ideas from new products to build for customers to buy them. We anticipate that we will hover just below or just above breakeven likely for years to come. Rather than depositing our profits in the bank, we will pour them back into our business, investing in innovation and bringing more customers onto our platform. And that's exactly what we've done, already evidenced by our toad pace of new product announcements through Q3 and into Q4 and our record growth in new large customers. We tend to roll new products out during what we call innovation lease. Since our last call, we hosted two of these: Speedweek where we released new speed enhancing features and demonstrated we run the fastest security, zero trust an all-around delivery network in the world and Birthday Week, which is our annual celebration of Coke's launch, where we announced new products that we think of as innovative gifts back to the Internet. These weeks don't just deliver new products. They're also some of the most effective marketing we do to attract new customers. During birthday week this year, for example, our organic inbound leads spiked nearly tenfold. I think this is because customers want to bet on the companies that are committed to innovation, and we've proven through these weeks over the years that innovation is deep in Cloudflare's DNA. Prior year's birthday weeks have had double the size of the encrypted web, unmetered DDoS mitigation and launched Cloudflare Workers, our surplus computing platform. Our strategy has always been to get these products to market early and then relentlessly iterate to improve them until they're best-of-breed and significant new lines of business for us. I'm particularly excited this year about three birthday week product announcements, R2, an object store being developed for Cloudflare Workers, our first e-mail security product, which is an area that customers have been asking us to enter for some time and cloud giver offices, which will make connecting to our Zero Trust network from many of the world's highest occupancy building, a matter of merely plugging in a patch cable. We have two more innovation week scheduled before the end of the year. Full stack where we'll detail the newest developments around our workers serverless computing platform and CIE, where we'll launch more products aimed at CIOs and demonstrate how cloud players, the network they can plug into and not have to worry about anything else. Stay soon. I'm often asked about how Cloudflare innovate so quickly. We have demonstrated not only the ability to release new products, but then build those products into meaningful new lines of business. The key to our pace of innovation starts with our flexible platform. Every server that makes up Claude's network is able to run every one of our features, Workers, which we've opened up to customers is, first and foremost, the computing platform on which our developers build most of our own features and our fully software-defined network than routes traffic to wherever it will be handled most efficiently. This is important because it means new products held up by procurement, but it doesn't stop there. One of our secret to success is our broad customer base that we have millions of customers, many of whom use our services for free means that we have an eager pool excited to test new features before they're released. While traditional B2B companies have extensive QA team, we regularly ask volunteers from our community to be our earliest alpha testers. Our iteration cycles can then be extremely fast. And by the time a feature makes its production at one of our enterprise customers, it's full of proof, having been through the paces under real network conditions. Not everything will be a runaway success, but this is the fertile soil from which innovative new products spring so readily. The conventional wisdom in business is that you should focus and do one thing well. That's a great strategy for building a good company, but it has never been the cloud our way. We are intent on building not just a good company but an iconic one, delivering on our mission of helping build a better Internet. We are building the network that any business can plug into and not have to worry about anything else. That's what our customers tell us they need. It requires us to do many things and over time become great at them all. you earn your place as a platform one feature at a time. But increasingly, one repeated theme I hear from our customers is that we have earned that play, not just as a feature provider but as their foundational networking platform. With that in mind, let me highlight some wins in the quarter. A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company expanded their use of our Cloudflare 1 platform. They signed a $600,000 expansion deal, bringing their total contract to over $2 million. They are using a broad range of our services, including Cloudflare Gateway, our Zero Trust web application gateway. They appreciate how the various pieces of our platform fit together to provide one unified network. It was a competitive deal and our unified approach beat out all other Zero Trust vendors with their narrow point solutions. A Fortune 500 manufacturing company adopted Caplan to protect its 50,000 employees. They signed a two-year contract worth over $0.5 million. Their previous hardware-based approach couldn't keep up with the latest security threats they were seeing. The technical team was familiar with Plaza, many having used our pay-as-you-go products for developers and championed us to the C-suite fire. At the same time, the C-suite buyer had heard from a peer in another manufacturing firm, how much they enjoyed working with Cloudflare and appreciated our rate of innovation. This is a great example of how we're seeing success, selling both bottoms up and tops down within organizations. A large European software company adopted our Zero Trust solution. They signed a 3-year $600,000 deal. Evaluating Cloudflare versus other leading zero trust solutions, they judged our products to be richer, more flexible, more scalable and easier to deploy. They also appreciated our integrated approach, providing a single platform to solve their broad set of network security, performance and reliability needs. A Fortune 500 retailer adopted cloud floor workers to build scalable online retail applications ahead of Black Friday. They're using durable objects to manage what they anticipate will be extremely high traffic volumes this holiday seen. They appreciate our customizability and effortless scalability. They've stress-tested their application with over 100,000 transactions per second and workers handled it without breaking a sweat. They signed a $200,000 annual deal, and we anticipate the account will grow significantly as they move more of their online retail application onto our platform. The Middle Eastern financial services provider signed a three-year $600,000 deal. They appreciated our global network with locations across the Middle East and our ability to deliver services that kept their sensitive customer data local in the regions they serve. Handling data locality requirements is one of the superpowers of edge computing over traditional cloud. The customer has already become a champion to other enterprises in the region. A national airline send a $180,000 contract for our Cloudflare One services. They appreciate the better accuracy and lower false positive rate of our security products. This is a customer that we started talking to right near the beginning of COVID, while our sales cycles are usually very fast, still typically less than a quarter. This one was slow as they are in an industry that was highly impacted by the pandemic, but I highlighted as a deal we won in Q3 because I think it shows light at the end of the tunnel, even highly coded impacted industries like airlines are starting to return to normal. And as they do, they're once again calling us to help with their network security, reliability and performance needs. If I step back, I will note that Q3 2021 was different in many ways in Q3 2020. While last year, the seasonality of summer seemed to disappear as people canceled vacations and worked without a break. This year, much of the world came out of lockdown in a parent desperate need of a vacation. July and August were quieter than normal and the quarter ended up being more back-end loaded than we usually see. Talking with peer companies and listening to earnings calls over the last two weeks, we don't believe there was anything about that unique to us. But refresh from a much-needed holiday, IT organizations now seem to have returned ready to roll up their sleeves and modernize their stacks for a post-COVID world. October started out very strong. In just the first week, a prominent social network chose Cloudflare One as their Zero Trust solution, finding a contract worth at least $1 million annually. That same week, one of the largest video conferencing services came under attack and onboarded onto Cloudflare, signing an $8 million annual deal. They push a lot of traffic, and we believe we are the only network provider with its scale and agility to have been able to onboard them over a weekend. And the coolest part, we not only mitigated the attacks, but their network performance actually improved. On top of that, we're confident, over time, we'll save them more in other providers' network bandwidth fees and we charge them ourselves, which is a totally magical experience and the recipe for a very sticky customer relationship. We have no intention of slowing down, and I wanted to thank all the teams working hard to help our customers build our business and live up to our mission of helping build a better Internet. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas to walk through the numbers. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We delivered another excellent quarter, driven by record large customer additions, which continues to outpace top line revenue. We achieved an important milestone in the third quarter, reaching non-GAAP operating profit and net income profitability for the first time. This milestone is a testament to the strength of our business model and our ability to drive both high growth and operational leverage. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 51% year-over-year to $172.3 million. You may recall in third quarter 2020 with a onetime benefit of $1.9 million related to a customer renewal. Excluding this onetime benefit, our year-over-year revenue growth would have been 53.5%. The growth in revenue was driven by another quarter of strong customer demand both in terms of new local acquisition as well as expansion within our existing customer base. From a geographic perspective, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. As a percent of revenue and increased 62% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 25% year-over-year, especially impressed by the accelerating growth we are seeing in Europe, which is driven by strength in large customers and expansion. We continue to expand our China network with JD Cloud and are seeing performance improvements for our customers of 30% or more compared to our previous China network. Turning to our customer metrics. We exited the quarter with 132,390 paying customers, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year with another record number of large customer additions in the third quarter, adding 172 large customers sequentially and 524 customers year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 1,260 large customers, representing an increase of 71% year-over-year. We saw significant expansion from our large customers, which allowed us to maintain a strong dollar-based net retention rate of 124%, consistent with last quarter. Third quarter gross margin was 79.2%, representing an increase of 120 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 15% of revenue in the third quarter. We remain committed to building out the footprint and capacity of our network and expect network CapEx to be 12% to 14% of revenue for fiscal 2021. The increase in our network CapEx range is due to increased investment in advance of strategic customer growth. Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 3% sequentially and year-over-year to 78%, with another strong hiring quarter where we saw our total number of employees increased 32% year-over-year to approximately 2,240 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $77.6 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and year-over-year. Research and development expenses were $32.8 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially and decreased to 19% from 21% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $23.9 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and year-over-year to 14% from 16% in the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong operating leverage in the third quarter with operating margin improving 530 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was $2.2 million compared to an operating loss of $4.5 million in the same period last year. In the last few years, we repeatedly accelerated our time line for profitability from an initial target of second half of 2022 at the IPO to most recently in the first quarter of 2022 as provided at our Investor Day earlier this year. We changed breakeven in the third quarter due to the inherent operating leverage characteristics of our business model. That said, I will echo what Matthew emphasized. Now that we've achieved breakeven, we intend to reinvest excess profitability back into the business for growth. We remain confident in our ability to reach our long-term operating margin target of 20% or higher. And when we say long term, we really mean it. Cloud layers optimized for innovation, and we plan to continue to launch new products, grow our customer base, relentlessly execute and reinvest for growth to pursue the significant market opportunity ahead of us. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $1.4 million or a net income per share of $0.00. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 33%. We wanted to provide some additional color on financing activities we pursued in the third quarter. In August, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and successfully launched $1.3 billion principal amount of a zero interest convertible senior note due in 2026. The additional capital secured at these attractive terms position us with greater flexibility to continue to invest and scale the business while cementing our strong financial position. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. This includes approximately $790 million of net proceeds from our convertible note issuance during the quarter. Free cash flow was negative $39.7 million or 23% of revenue compared to negative $17.9 million or 16% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was negative $6.9 million in the third quarter or 4% of revenue, which decreased $14.4 million sequentially and decreased $8.9 million year-over-year. Worth noting is a $29.4 million cash outflow included in operating cash flow and free cash flow related to the repurchase of the 2025 convertible senior notes. As we mentioned previously, we expect to continue to see some level of variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital, the growth in our large enterprise business and seasonal factors. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, came in at $545 million, representing an increase of 13% sequentially and 60% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. We remain optimistic and confident in the continued growth of our business. As such, we are pleased to raise guidance for both the quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $184 million to $185 million, representing an increase of 46% to 47% year-over-year. We expect operating loss to be in the range of $1 million to breakeven, and we expect net loss per share of $0.01 to breakeven. For modeling purposes, please note that if we report positive net income in Q4, we expect our share count to be $345 million fully diluted share versus $320 million basic shares if we report a net loss. We expect a tax expense of $1.6 million. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $647 million to $648 million, representing an increase of 50% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $10.5 million to $9.5 million, and we expect net loss per share over that period in the range of $0.06 to $0.05, assuming approximately 312 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $5.9 million. In closing, we are very proud of across the significant milestone of profitability, which is only two years after our IPO and one year ahead of the expected time line we initially shared at the time of our IPO. Would like to thank all Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication to innovate and deliver our customers, partners and the community for their ample trust and support. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks, guys, and congrats on the results here. Yeah, Matthew or Thomas, success in large customers was again super impressive. Now I think clearly, this is a reflection of your products and vision. But can you talk about other aspects that could be positively impacting some of these large deals like direct rep productivity, maybe it's partners influencing deals. And I know everybody wants to know about the competitive landscape as you move up into the larger enterprise or?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I'll start, Matt, and then Thomas can weigh in with some more. So I think that success often is a combination of doing lots of things well. And we really have continued to march upmarket to larger and larger customers over time. So I think a couple of things are true. One, as we have successfully launched more and more products, we're seeing those products attach to our existing customers. And so about half of the customers that are new, large customers are existing customers that spend more with us and grow into that category. But the other half our new customers are totally new logos to us. And I think that is both our success of building out our sales team and our go-to-market motion, where increasingly, we have absolutely top-notch field sellers with relationships to sell into those larger and larger accounts. And we're seeing success in going upmarket. I think that what we want to deliver and what we're building, if you fast forward 10 years from now, it's going to look like a traditional enterprise sales team, what's different about how we're building that is, as we've always said, that we get to invest behind the demand, not in front of it. And I think that the difference is that makes it less likely that we make a mistake as we continue to move upmarket. In terms of the competitive landscape, I don't think we've seen a significant change. I think our win rates across competitors continue to be very attractive and improving. We still think that there are a whole bunch of legacy hardware boxes that are out there that we are replacing. And I think we're on the right side of history. And so more and more customers are turning to us. I think the last thing is that COVID was a real wake-up call for IT organizations. And what I hear over and over again from the largest companies, even folks that were very cloud reticent in the past is that they never want to live through something like that again. And so organizations that might have been hesitant to use a service like Cloudflare now see us as a no-brainer. And so I think while COVID was difficult insofar as IT organizations really battened down the hatches and shut things down. I think what we're seeing now is that people are coming out the other side, people are saying, okay, I need to embrace the cloud. I need to embrace a service like Cloudflare. And I think we're in a unique time where everyone is taking our phone calls.\nMatt Hedberg: That's super helpful. And then I have to ask about R2. Obviously, that was a really exciting announcement this quarter. And I know it's going to take time to impact the model. But perhaps you could talk a little bit more, double click on really how this positions you guys as really an edge cloud provider, even more so now with.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So R2 for those who might not be following along as closely as Matt is our object store. And if you think about what are the key components of being a cloud provider, you have to have compute, but you have to have a way also of storing data. And some of those things are databases, which we're building out in various ways. Some of those are also ways that you store objects. So those are like files that would be at the edge. And because of where we sit, where we are the network in front of many of the largest cloud providers customers, we were able to really study how customers were using various cloud providers. And we came to the conclusion that the right thing for us on our product road map was to build an object store. And one of the things that is unique about where we sit versus some of the more traditional and legacy cloud providers is that because we are distributed at the edge, it allows us to be significantly more efficient in the bandwidth usage that we have. And so while typical cloud providers have to pay a series of middlemen to deliver from Ashburn, Virginia to the other side of the earth, we are already on the other side of the earth, and we have usually a direct connection to all of those other networks that are there, which means that we have an inherent competitive advantage in terms of the cost of bandwidth delivery that we can provide. And so we see that because of the fact that we have that attractive pricing, we should be passing that on to customers, and we're excited for building out R2 and seeing how that further enhances our workers' platform, which every day, people are building more and more complicated applications on. And I think this is going to allow that to just accelerate.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks, Matthew.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Great. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the scale of the TAM implied by the R2 product. I mean, clearly, it's a big opportunity, but it's hard for us to really grasp the scale of that opportunity since most of the data associated with the revenues would be masked underneath the larger companies business. And while you're at it, if you could talk a little bit about the Bitcoin blockchain announcement e-mail announcement and net for offices, what does that add to your potential opportunity that would be very helpful as well.\nMatthew Prince: Alex, that's a mouthful of things to go through. We had an entire week of announcements, and I think you just listed all of them for me to summarize. But let me start. So I think that it's early days in terms of R2. But what I think that we hope is that R2 can be very disruptive in the market and not only allow us to capture more of the object store spend, but also put downward pressure on all of the different cloud providers to eliminate their egress fees. It is completely absurd that these companies are charging nothing to send data to them, but then charging what can be massive markups, 80x what the wholesale price is to take data back out. And we don't think that's sustainable, and we want to push that down. The reason why that's attractive to us is we think that our long-term opportunity is really to be the fabric that connects together the various cloud providers. And in an ideal world, what we hear from customers is that they want to use some cloud flare services, but they want to use Google services and Microsoft services and Amazon services and pick the best of what they need across all of those different providers in order to deliver a more robust application. And I think that is the inevitable way that the market will play out over time and that being that fabric that can connect those different networks together is a very powerful position for us to be in. And so R2 is both, I think, an opportunity for us to grow TAM, but it's also an opportunity for us to accelerate what I think is the inevitable next generation of the cloud, which is allowing customers to pick the best of breed across multiple clouds. And I'm optimistic that across the entire industry, if we really do encourage competition on a feature-by-feature basis. And we don't lock customers in, in artificial ways like charging for egress but not in grass, that actually will expand the TAM of the entire cloud industry. And so I'm bullish on kind of everyone who's in the space. On the rest of the announcement, e-mail is one of those areas that we've been asking that customers have been asking us for, for quite some time. I think it's stagnated as a solution. And so we think that with the network that we have and the data that we see across all of what we provide in terms of our DNS service as well as our other services that we'll be able to provide a really outstanding product around that. One of the things that we're hearing from customers, they're particularly excited about is really a mix of our browser isolation technology with an e-mail security product. Imagine, for instance, if you can make sure that any link that is in an e-mail didn't actually get executed on your local computer, but instead got executed in an isolated browser, which was running out at our edge. We have all the components to be able to do that. And if you look back at all of the security incidents that have happened across the space, that one technology closes the biggest hole in most enterprise IT spaces. So it's an area that we think is extremely exciting. Clapper offices is our announcement about putting our equipment in starting with about 1,000 of the most populated and most traffic office buildings in the world. And we think that, that just is an easier on-ramp to get customers onto our network. And one of the things that we're particularly excited about with that is that we can actually create an MPLS replacement to connect various branch offices together, but do it in a way which is almost instantaneous to turn up, whereas you usually have to wait weeks or months to get a private network like that turned up otherwise. And I think that what we announced around Web 3.0 and the crypto space again, I think that we want to be the bridge between what was the traditional web and what may be coming with Web 3.0. And we've been investing in this space for quite some time. I think we don't know exactly where it's going to go, and I don't think anyone necessarily does. But we have a really brilliant team that's thinking about this, and we want to be positioned that if it does become the next thing that Cloudflare helps provide the rails to make sure that Web 3.0 works as well as some of the optimistic forecasts suggest it could. So again, I think that if you're not following our blog, if you're not following our innovation weeks and you're interested in Cloudflare, we try to make these announcements as accessible as possible. And we try to make lots and lots of bets. We don't know that all of them are going to be homeruns. But if you look back in the history of birthday weeks, things like Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects were products that we announced during that time, and those have then subsequently become very significant lines of business for us.\nAlex Henderson: So, just to conclude then you're not just going to be the fourth cloud, you're actually going to be the first true network cloud. And that's what the point of all of those.\nMatthew Prince: Well, again, I think we are focused on how we can be the network that any company plugs into and literally doesn't have to worry about anything else.\nAlex Henderson: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shaul Eyal from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. good afternoon, and congrats on the strong performance. Matthew, great performance on Workers, Cloudflare One, Teams. Also wanted to hear a little bit, any wins associated with the Magic Transit product, your ability to displace MPLS. And I have a follow-up on R2.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks, Shaul. I think Magic Transit is really one of our key winners. And I think it's been a very easy product for our existing sales team to sell to our existing customers. And so a number of the wins that I highlighted in the quarter, including the pharmaceutical company, the Fortune 500 manufacturing company, they are adopting Magic Transit as part of the overall bundle. But I think the thing that I'm hearing more and more is that customers are increasingly not seeing us as providing one single point solution or one single feature, but that we have earned being a platform to provide an overall solution to, again, be that network that customers can plug into and not have to worry about anything else. And so Magic Transit is part of a lot of these deals. It becomes very sticky as part of it. We think that, that will further accelerate with what we're doing for Cloudflare for offices. And again, it's been a very natural addition to sell to our existing customer base. The deal that I highlighted that happened early in Q4, the large video conferencing service. And that was in fact, when we were designing Magic Transit, we said one day, if we build this right, this particular customer would be able to sign up and not only would be able to help them protect them from a security perspective, but we'd also be able to actually accelerate their traffic. And that's exactly what ended up happening. The customer came under an attack. We were able to very quickly onboard them in their time of need. They have a global customer base themselves, and they were very pleasantly surprised when not only were we able to stop the attack, but that their own internal measurement, the performance got better. That's why we call Magic Transit as magic is it really does for customers feel like magic.\nShaul Eyal: Got it. Understood. And maybe one more on R2. I know it's absolutely early days, but how would you characterize the level of sign-ups so far?\nMatthew Prince: Off the charts. I mean, I think that we were surprised by how much it resonated across the customer base. We usually, during these innovation weeks, see an uptick in our inbound interest. But in terms of the organic leads that we saw, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw a tenfold, so 10x increase in the number of organic inbound interest. And I think it points to that customers, whether they're small or large, feel like the egress fees that they're being charged by the sort of legacy cloud providers are agreed to, and they're looking for a solution. And if we can help provide that, I think that's a very exciting opportunity for us.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellence. Thanks for taking the question, and very nice quarter, guys. If this quarter is showing a seasonal slowness and then summer, I hate to see what your quarters look like if you don't see seasonal flows, there's really no signs of weakness in this grant. We talked a lot about the expanding solution portfolio. And you're right, it's absolutely incredible how quickly it's been expanding. And we've also talked about sort of building out that direct sales force behind that move up market. Can we perhaps kind of bring the two together, like as you guys expand out that solution portfolio and if you're innovating in different directions, I mean, you're dealing with core security guys and now guys who are working on the e-mail side of the equation and core networking guys and core developers on workers. Does the distribution strategy in itself have to change? Do you have to get more segmented or do you have to restructure the sales force at all to deal with that expansion of the solution portfolio?\nMatthew Prince: Yeah, Keith. So first of all, I noticed your question to Satya, which sounded like it was about us you didn't name drop us. So you're a little bit...\nKeith Weiss: I was just talking about large opportunities that are out there for many different cloud providers to try to...\nMatthew Prince: Well, I appreciate it. And again, you can't be too much in the dog as if you're so question number four. So we're constantly adjusting how our sales team works. And so for instance, it used to be that our solutions engineering team was both presale and post-sale. Now we have specialized teams that are different for presale and post-sale. And that's an adjustment that's come over time. I think that we have specialists in individual products that specialize in various areas, and we have internal training to make sure that our sales enablement is strong across our team. And so as we continue to go upmarket that requires a different sales motion and a different type of seller, and we are amazed that over the last 12 months, we've had nearly 0.25 million people apply to work at Cloudflare, which is just astonishing. And so if you look across that, about half of those applicants are for our go-to-market team and the caliber and quality of the people that we're getting is great. And so as we continue to build that out, we will continue to not believe that what we did yesterday is the solution for what we need to do tomorrow and both hire a different type of sales person to service larger customers and then also have specialization across it. One thing I think that is interesting internally that we do is a lot of these new products come out of a group that we call ETI, which stands for emerging technology and incubation. And that group, their goal is to take lots of shots on goal and launch lots of products. And then when a product takes off like a workers or a team when it's the right time, those products then graduate to our more traditional product and engineering group. And the EPI Group does have a small go-to-market team that helps with these new functions, kind of write the initial playbook and certain products like Magic Transit are a very easy add-on to our existing customer base, something like Teams is actually sometimes is a different buyer. And so we're having to figure out how to navigate horizontally inside organizations. And as I highlighted in one of the examples, more and more, we're building the relationship with the C-level executives so that we have that executive sponsorship. And again, you've got to do multiple things right in order to continue to execute the way we are. And so what our sales team will look like and what our go-to-market team will look like in five years will be very different than it is now. But I think it's a very natural progression from where we are now to where we're going.\nKeith Weiss: Outstanding. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Fish from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. You guys started to do recently some more for larger enterprise customers around privacy. What are your expectations for that privacy part of the business over the next few years as it pertains to helping to protect consumers' identities? And then broadly, what's your strategy for expanding more into identity security in and of itself?\nMatthew Prince: Thanks, Jim. So when we launched the company, there were really three pillars that were the kind of core values at Cloudflare in terms of sort of how we thought about products. We thought about how do we build products that make you more secure, how we build products that make you more reliable and how do we build products that make you fast. And that whenever we think about products, we're thinking about how we can do one or more of those things. I think what's become clear over the last four years has been there are two additional things. we would add to that list. One is efficiency. So how do we build products that help customers save money and really just have a very clear ROI for them. And then the last is privacy, where we have never and we will never sell our customers' data or our customers' customers' data. And so I think that, that has made it very easy for us to commit to the privacy regulations that are springing up around the rest of the world and to be thinking about our products in ways to build them to comply with those regulations. And so I see that there are a number of customers, so for example, the Middle Eastern bank that I highlighted in the prepared remarks, they really appreciated the fact that we have locations in the markets that they service and that we could help them keep their data there so that they would comply with what are, again, the regulations that come out of this privacy landscape. And so I think because of the fact that it's been very easy for us to be privacy first. And that's something that none of the other cloud providers have. They all have advertising businesses attached to them in one way or another. We are very clean in that sense. And so it has allowed us to be a great partner to organizations that do believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. And so I think that, that's something that is very much aligned across our business. And I think we don't exactly know where that will go. But I think that if you had to bet that being on the more private side of the Internet is being on the right side of history.\nJim Fish: Makes sense. And Costa for offices has gotten a little bit overshadowed by ARI. So I just wanted to touch upon that briefly. Any sense to the ramp that we could expect for either the number of offices over the next year, how you're thinking about that business in particular?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So, I'll predict that the sleeper announcement from our birthday week that might be the most impactful to our business, over the course of the next 10 years will be cloud suffer offices. And what we have seen is that the excitement from landlords and real estate groups about being able to offer Cloudflare services to their tenants is much higher than we actually expected, not only at the time of the announcement, but then subsequently. What it really offers is an ability for any tenant to plug into our network and be able to yet have fast connection to the Internet, but also get all the security, reliability and efficiency gains that we deliver. And so I think that the ramp of that is designed very much to be driven by where customer demand comes from. We have secured the ability to have access to a very large number of the office buildings and to be able to get connectivity from those office buildings out to the rest of the world. But I think that there's an opportunity that if we execute on the vision that we outlined that Cloudflare may well have one of, if not the largest backbone network across the entire Internet. And I think, again, that continues to execute on our vision of how can we be the fabric that connects all of these different services together with the ability to be programmable and have security built in. Sort of, again, what we say our mission is to help build a better Internet. And at some level, what we're doing is thinking about, gosh, if we all knew what the Internet was going to become, and we had a time machine to go back 40 years and say, do it differently. I mean, Cloudflare is time machine. And we continue to think about how can we make the Internet itself fundamentally better and deliver real value to our customers. So I'm extremely excited about Cloudflare offices. Watch this space, because I think there are going to be a lot of exciting partnerships as we bring that forward. And then it will be something that we can deliver real value to customers around the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTrevor Walsh: Hey, thanks. This is Trevor Walsh on for Pat. Thanks for taking our questions. Matthew, I wanted to just see, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks around a lot of the wins talked about Zero Trust over the quarter as kind of the driving force. And I just wanted to see if you could provide some further details around whether those were coming in via RFPs or RFIs just generally as part of a larger kind of ecosystem of Zero Test vendors or Cloudflare? Or just was it really more cloud fare competitively centric that way and how that kind of how those played out?\nMatthew Prince: Trevor, thanks for the question. In almost all of those cases, those were competitive deals that were coming through either an RFP or RFI process or they were even if it wasn't a formal RFP or RFI process, there were other names that were providing more limited sets of Zero Trust features. And what we are seeing is that we are winning in those competitive head-to-head deals because, first of all, we are significantly easier to deploy and implement Secondly, we have a richer feature set especially when you take into account the entire platform. Third, we deliver significantly higher ROI for the investment that's there. And then fourth, there's a natural integration across the entire network that is provided. So I think that this is obviously a newer area that we have gotten into. But I am very proud of our team and the win rates that we have against some better known vendors in the Zero Trust space, and I think that there is a very big opportunity for us to continue to deliver because, again, we've built a platform that can scale in a way that I don't think that any other Zero Trust vendor has.\nTrevor Walsh: Awesome. Great. And maybe one quick one for maybe Thomas best to handle. I also noticed that you guys expanded the proprietary network again this quarter. I was wondering if any of the supply chain issues kind of made that process a little bit more challenging shall we say, given some of the constraints there?\nThomas Seifert: Not really. Our infrastructure team has managed us and the footprint of the network really well through COVID and the supply chain disruptions. We ordered early, we signed long-term agreements, and we sometimes order ahead of our need just to make sure that we are protected. So, I would say, we saw hardly any impact in our buildout during the third quarter from supply chain and net eruptions.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks, all. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe Gallo: You have Joe on for Brent. I really appreciate the question and congrats on the results. Can you guys provide just an update on the APAC region and how the rollout is going in China and maybe when we can expect growth in that region bouncing back to more company norms?\nThomas Seifert: So we are actually happy with the progress we are seeing. Remember, on the last two earnings calls, we said it would take us about towards the end of the year until we are back to historical growth rates in APAC, and I think that this still holds true. We've seen the first quarter-over-quarter improvement in the third quarter, where year-over-year growth rate is slightly picking up. The team there is doing a really good job to get us on target. So I think we are in contract with what we said before, and we'll be back to historical growth rates by the end of this fiscal year.\nJoe Gallo: It's great to hear. And it's great to hear about the strength in large deals. Maybe just an update also on the federal business and any initiatives there?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So I can take that. As we talked about last quarter, along with Accenture, we're able to secure a big deal across the business. We don't anticipate, as we said last time, that will have a material impact on revenues until 2022, but that is going very well. And I think that what we're seeing is more and more agencies within the federal business are excited to work with us. We also anticipate that early in 2022, we will reach our moderate full FedRAMP compliance. We're already able to with the achievement that we have sell into the federal government under the provisional compliance that we have in place. And so I think that, that puts us in place to be able to deliver that. And we're hiring right now to be able to build out our federal team to be able to handle what we anticipate will be strong demand.\nJoe Gallo: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Breen from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJim Breen: Thanks. Just to take off on the other question was asked around sort of distribution. You guys are offering more products and you have things like Cloudflare 1 and workers and so forth. Is there a section of your customer base that's maybe not large enterprise and not the small end that can be served by a channel partner type of sales scenario where you're not putting as much of your own resources into it, but can still generate sales in that space so that mid-market enterprise starts to really just figure out that they need a lot of the products that you're offering?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Jim, I think that channel is something that has been part of our mix for quite some time, but is not yet at the place where we think there's an opportunity for it to be. And so channel has always been a challenge for SaaS companies. And I think historically, One of the problems for channel partners with us was for a lot of our traditional products, it took 5 minutes to onboard. And so there wasn't a lot of value to add for a value-added reseller. But I think what you're seeing is as our products are getting more sophisticated, that channel partners are able to really create value in specialization and customization for that. So you see how that with Accenture, which we went to market with, obviously, on the large end of that, we have had a long-term channel partnership relationship with IBM, which has been very successful for us. But I think that expanding our use of the channel in 2022 is one of the focus areas. And I agree with you that that's an area where we can get even further leverage in our go-to-market spend.\nJim Breen: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to follow up on Cloudflare One in the SaaS market. Other vendors claim you need more of a proxy-based architecture to apply to per user basis to really be effective in that sort of zero trust market. I'm just wondering if you could provide any more color on whether that comes up in your bake-offs in the Zero Trust or SaaS space.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Andrew. So we are a proxy. I think sometimes people think that because we started out what's known in the industry as a reverse proxy that we aren't that we can't be a forward proxy, but it turns out that it's as easy to make the traffic flow one way through the pipe as it is to make it flow the other way through the pipe. And so what's really powerful is because we not only built that proxy infrastructure, and we are in more than 250 cities worldwide. We have an incredible amount of capacity and scalability. And we have all of the existing security features built in that I think that our proxy when it's compared head to head with some of the other providers, shines both on a performance perspective, where we actually usually will accelerate customers' traffic, whereas other solutions typically slow it down. And then also on a broad security threat basis, where we're increasingly seeing attackers launch things like denial of service attacks and the traditional providers just don't have the capacity to be able to stay ahead of that, whereas we do because that's part of what has been our more historic product. I think what we are building out is actually more of the clients that exist on individual devices to augment the proxy services. And so the great news for that for us is that because we've had consumer-facing products like Cloudflare One, we have the world's biggest QA organization, where there are literally tens of millions of people using Wharf every day, taking the tires and making sure that it works well, not only on desktops and laptops, but on really difficult environments like mobile phones, where usually competitive solutions will massively burn battery life or decrease performance. So I think that we are very well positioned to be able to win that space. I think our challenge is just making sure that there's awareness and that we really refine our go-to-market motion. But we're seeing success and we're seeing wins. And when we go head to head with some of the other competitors out there, I really like our win rates.\nAndrew Nowinski: That's great. Thank you for that color. And then just maybe shifting gears. I just wanted to ask another question on R2. Do you think that some of the more typical use cases where you'll see stores deployed in R2 are the traditional enterprise workloads? Or do you think that maybe it's more a next-gen use cases like [inaudible] cars, et cetera? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Well, the interest - so, we're focused on the present and focused on building solutions for companies that exist today and problems that exist today. And so we have an internal rule that anyone who mentions driverless cars when talking about Cloudflare Workers has to do a shot. And so I think that I would rather bet on applications that exist today. And what we're seeing, for example, from the very large retailer that's concerned about the traffic volumes of our Black Friday, we're building a solution that easily scaled to them to over 100,000 requests per second. If you do the math out on that, that is across one customer well over $1 trillion requests per quarter. And we see nearly $1 trillion request per day from the users of Workers. So our ability to scale and deliver real applications has really been built over the fact that we had that product in market for the last four years. And as we add things like a R2, I think it just continues to make it a richer platform and that we're seeing real large retailers, financial services, health care, adopt. And someday, driverless cars use it too, that's great. But in the meantime, we'll focus on real problems at the moment.\nAndrew Nowinski: That's great. Thank you, guys.\nJayson Noland: Julianne, can we take questions from one last analyst, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question will come from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks. I'm glad I made it under the line there. I guess I have two, they're both on R2 as well. Matthew, I'm wondering if AWS tomorrow was to take the egress fees to 0 in theory, what would the value proposition for R2 become in that scenario? And I'm trying to understand what would you say of the reasons one should go to R2 versus AWS beyond the egress fees.\nMatthew Prince: If AWS takes egress fees to 0 tomorrow, I will do a dance of joy for all of our mutual customers. And that will put us in a position, I think, of finally realizing what is the ultimate opportunity of the cloud, which is how do we allow customers to take advantage of the best of what Amazon offers the best of what Google offers the best of what Microsoft offers the best of what Oracle offers and the best of what cloud player offers. And if we can be the fabric that connects all of that together, that's great. In the meantime, because I don't think that AWS is going to take egress fees to 0 tomorrow. We're going to make products that perform at least as well as theirs do, but don't rate customers over the coals for what our agreed or egress fees. So I hope that your hypothetical comes true. I think it's unlikely that it would, but that would be a great thing for customers. And I think it would force us to continue to innovate in that space, just like it would force everyone else to innovate in the space and who wins in that case as customers.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then I think you probably talked about the goal is eventually become the fourth major public cloud. And I'm curious, to be that, what does that do to your TAM, which you've talked about being $100 billion in a couple of years. What does it do to that? And then what sort of CapEx investments do you need to make to achieve this goal?\nMatthew Prince: Again, I think the good - taking the second part of the question first. The good news is we've made substantial CapEx investments around the world. And the efficiency of running an edge network like ours is actually substantially lower CapEx versus traditional centralized cloud providers. We get the benefits of taking advantage of the entire Internet and the routing system around the world and then can put data wherever it makes the most sense for customers and store it there. So we've got substantial storage and compute capacity across our entire network. One of the things that was important about the fact that we started out very much as a security company, is that security applications require significant compute. And so we have actually deployed unlike some of the more point CDN solutions. When you look at our nodes, they're very heavy on compute. And that's part of why we've been able to scale up our computing solution as quickly as possible. They also have a ton of disc in them. And so that means that there's storage that we can provide in those locations. We're confident that we can provide the R2 service in a way that has very attractive economics for us. And we're also confident in part because our infrastructure team has gotten so good at building to the capacity that we need, that if we do see demand, which is significant that we will be able to invest in CapEx behind that demand. So I don't think that as a percentage of revenue R2 meaningfully changes our CapEx spend. But if it is wildly successful, our CapEx might go up, but that would be correlated with our revenue going up. Does that make sense in answering your question?\nAmit Daryanani: Perfectly. Thank you very much.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you.\nOperator: We are out of time for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: I appreciate everyone at Cloudflare for the hard work of delivering what really was a milestone quarter for us. We are incredibly proud of achieving profitability. And I just wanted to repeat one more time what I said what Thomas said, which is we are nowhere near out of ideas of things to build and customers sell them to. And so we are going to continue to reinvest our profits back into the business in order to build what we really believe is going to be one of the truly iconic technology companies. Thank you all for being investors. Thank you for tuning in. We'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We delivered another excellent quarter, driven by record large customer additions, which continues to outpace top line revenue. We achieved an important milestone in the third quarter, reaching non-GAAP operating profit and net income profitability for the first time. This milestone is a testament to the strength of our business model and our ability to drive both high growth and operational leverage. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 51% year-over-year to $172.3 million. You may recall in third quarter 2020 with a onetime benefit of $1.9 million related to a customer renewal. Excluding this onetime benefit, our year-over-year revenue growth would have been 53.5%. The growth in revenue was driven by another quarter of strong customer demand both in terms of new local acquisition as well as expansion within our existing customer base. From a geographic perspective, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. As a percent of revenue and increased 62% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 25% year-over-year, especially impressed by the accelerating growth we are seeing in Europe, which is driven by strength in large customers and expansion. We continue to expand our China network with JD Cloud and are seeing performance improvements for our customers of 30% or more compared to our previous China network. Turning to our customer metrics. We exited the quarter with 132,390 paying customers, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year with another record number of large customer additions in the third quarter, adding 172 large customers sequentially and 524 customers year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 1,260 large customers, representing an increase of 71% year-over-year. We saw significant expansion from our large customers, which allowed us to maintain a strong dollar-based net retention rate of 124%, consistent with last quarter. Third quarter gross margin was 79.2%, representing an increase of 120 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 15% of revenue in the third quarter. We remain committed to building out the footprint and capacity of our network and expect network CapEx to be 12% to 14% of revenue for fiscal 2021. The increase in our network CapEx range is due to increased investment in advance of strategic customer growth. Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 3% sequentially and year-over-year to 78%, with another strong hiring quarter where we saw our total number of employees increased 32% year-over-year to approximately 2,240 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $77.6 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and year-over-year. Research and development expenses were $32.8 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially and decreased to 19% from 21% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $23.9 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and year-over-year to 14% from 16% in the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong operating leverage in the third quarter with operating margin improving 530 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was $2.2 million compared to an operating loss of $4.5 million in the same period last year. In the last few years, we repeatedly accelerated our time line for profitability from an initial target of second half of 2022 at the IPO to most recently in the first quarter of 2022 as provided at our Investor Day earlier this year. We changed breakeven in the third quarter due to the inherent operating leverage characteristics of our business model. That said, I will echo what Matthew emphasized. Now that we've achieved breakeven, we intend to reinvest excess profitability back into the business for growth. We remain confident in our ability to reach our long-term operating margin target of 20% or higher. And when we say long term, we really mean it. Cloud layers optimized for innovation, and we plan to continue to launch new products, grow our customer base, relentlessly execute and reinvest for growth to pursue the significant market opportunity ahead of us. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $1.4 million or a net income per share of $0.00. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 33%. We wanted to provide some additional color on financing activities we pursued in the third quarter. In August, we took advantage of favorable market conditions and successfully launched $1.3 billion principal amount of a zero interest convertible senior note due in 2026. The additional capital secured at these attractive terms position us with greater flexibility to continue to invest and scale the business while cementing our strong financial position. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. This includes approximately $790 million of net proceeds from our convertible note issuance during the quarter. Free cash flow was negative $39.7 million or 23% of revenue compared to negative $17.9 million or 16% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was negative $6.9 million in the third quarter or 4% of revenue, which decreased $14.4 million sequentially and decreased $8.9 million year-over-year. Worth noting is a $29.4 million cash outflow included in operating cash flow and free cash flow related to the repurchase of the 2025 convertible senior notes. As we mentioned previously, we expect to continue to see some level of variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital, the growth in our large enterprise business and seasonal factors. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, came in at $545 million, representing an increase of 13% sequentially and 60% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. We remain optimistic and confident in the continued growth of our business. As such, we are pleased to raise guidance for both the quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $184 million to $185 million, representing an increase of 46% to 47% year-over-year. We expect operating loss to be in the range of $1 million to breakeven, and we expect net loss per share of $0.01 to breakeven. For modeling purposes, please note that if we report positive net income in Q4, we expect our share count to be $345 million fully diluted share versus $320 million basic shares if we report a net loss. We expect a tax expense of $1.6 million. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $647 million to $648 million, representing an increase of 50% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $10.5 million to $9.5 million, and we expect net loss per share over that period in the range of $0.06 to $0.05, assuming approximately 312 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $5.9 million. In closing, we are very proud of across the significant milestone of profitability, which is only two years after our IPO and one year ahead of the expected time line we initially shared at the time of our IPO. Would like to thank all Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication to innovate and deliver our customers, partners and the community for their ample trust and support. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Not really. Our infrastructure team has managed us and the footprint of the network really well through COVID and the supply chain disruptions. We ordered early, we signed long-term agreements, and we sometimes order ahead of our need just to make sure that we are protected. So, I would say, we saw hardly any impact in our buildout during the third quarter from supply chain and net eruptions. So we are actually happy with the progress we are seeing. Remember, on the last two earnings calls, we said it would take us about towards the end of the year until we are back to historical growth rates in APAC, and I think that this still holds true. We've seen the first quarter-over-quarter improvement in the third quarter, where year-over-year growth rate is slightly picking up. The team there is doing a really good job to get us on target. So I think we are in contract with what we said before, and we'll be back to historical growth rates by the end of this fiscal year."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Jayson. We had a landmark quarter. In Q3, we achieved revenue of $172 million, up 51% year-over-year. We continue to see particular strength across our large customer segment, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, and ended the quarter with 1,260 large customers, up 16% quarter-over-quarter and 71% year-over-year. Our average contracted customer now spends over $100,000 annually with us, up from an average of $72,000 when we went public just over two years ago, evidencing our success selling to larger and larger enterprises. Our dollar-based net retention remained strong at 124%, and we achieved a record gross margin of over 79% in the quarter. It was also a milestone quarter because we reached profitability, delivering a positive operating margin and EPS. When we went public, we anticipated we'd reach breakeven in the second half of 2022. At our Investor Day earlier this year, we updated that forecast to Q1 of 2022, but our continued strong growth and relentless efficiency allowed us to reach this milestone even earlier. While we are proud to be profitable, I want to repeat what I said in our earnings call last quarter. We have a long-term operating margin target of 20%. We remain confident in our ability to reach that long-term target, but we are not in a rush to get there. When we say long term, we really mean it. As long as we can achieve extraordinary growth, we anticipate that we will pour our profits back into our research and development and sales and marketing machine. We are nowhere close to being out of ideas from new products to build for customers to buy them. We anticipate that we will hover just below or just above breakeven likely for years to come. Rather than depositing our profits in the bank, we will pour them back into our business, investing in innovation and bringing more customers onto our platform. And that's exactly what we've done, already evidenced by our toad pace of new product announcements through Q3 and into Q4 and our record growth in new large customers. We tend to roll new products out during what we call innovation lease. Since our last call, we hosted two of these: Speedweek where we released new speed enhancing features and demonstrated we run the fastest security, zero trust an all-around delivery network in the world and Birthday Week, which is our annual celebration of Coke's launch, where we announced new products that we think of as innovative gifts back to the Internet. These weeks don't just deliver new products. They're also some of the most effective marketing we do to attract new customers. During birthday week this year, for example, our organic inbound leads spiked nearly tenfold. I think this is because customers want to bet on the companies that are committed to innovation, and we've proven through these weeks over the years that innovation is deep in Cloudflare's DNA. Prior year's birthday weeks have had double the size of the encrypted web, unmetered DDoS mitigation and launched Cloudflare Workers, our surplus computing platform. Our strategy has always been to get these products to market early and then relentlessly iterate to improve them until they're best-of-breed and significant new lines of business for us. I'm particularly excited this year about three birthday week product announcements, R2, an object store being developed for Cloudflare Workers, our first e-mail security product, which is an area that customers have been asking us to enter for some time and cloud giver offices, which will make connecting to our Zero Trust network from many of the world's highest occupancy building, a matter of merely plugging in a patch cable. We have two more innovation week scheduled before the end of the year. Full stack where we'll detail the newest developments around our workers serverless computing platform and CIE, where we'll launch more products aimed at CIOs and demonstrate how cloud players, the network they can plug into and not have to worry about anything else. Stay soon. I'm often asked about how Cloudflare innovate so quickly. We have demonstrated not only the ability to release new products, but then build those products into meaningful new lines of business. The key to our pace of innovation starts with our flexible platform. Every server that makes up Claude's network is able to run every one of our features, Workers, which we've opened up to customers is, first and foremost, the computing platform on which our developers build most of our own features and our fully software-defined network than routes traffic to wherever it will be handled most efficiently. This is important because it means new products held up by procurement, but it doesn't stop there. One of our secret to success is our broad customer base that we have millions of customers, many of whom use our services for free means that we have an eager pool excited to test new features before they're released. While traditional B2B companies have extensive QA team, we regularly ask volunteers from our community to be our earliest alpha testers. Our iteration cycles can then be extremely fast. And by the time a feature makes its production at one of our enterprise customers, it's full of proof, having been through the paces under real network conditions. Not everything will be a runaway success, but this is the fertile soil from which innovative new products spring so readily. The conventional wisdom in business is that you should focus and do one thing well. That's a great strategy for building a good company, but it has never been the cloud our way. We are intent on building not just a good company but an iconic one, delivering on our mission of helping build a better Internet. We are building the network that any business can plug into and not have to worry about anything else. That's what our customers tell us they need. It requires us to do many things and over time become great at them all. you earn your place as a platform one feature at a time. But increasingly, one repeated theme I hear from our customers is that we have earned that play, not just as a feature provider but as their foundational networking platform. With that in mind, let me highlight some wins in the quarter. A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company expanded their use of our Cloudflare 1 platform. They signed a $600,000 expansion deal, bringing their total contract to over $2 million. They are using a broad range of our services, including Cloudflare Gateway, our Zero Trust web application gateway. They appreciate how the various pieces of our platform fit together to provide one unified network. It was a competitive deal and our unified approach beat out all other Zero Trust vendors with their narrow point solutions. A Fortune 500 manufacturing company adopted Caplan to protect its 50,000 employees. They signed a two-year contract worth over $0.5 million. Their previous hardware-based approach couldn't keep up with the latest security threats they were seeing. The technical team was familiar with Plaza, many having used our pay-as-you-go products for developers and championed us to the C-suite fire. At the same time, the C-suite buyer had heard from a peer in another manufacturing firm, how much they enjoyed working with Cloudflare and appreciated our rate of innovation. This is a great example of how we're seeing success, selling both bottoms up and tops down within organizations. A large European software company adopted our Zero Trust solution. They signed a 3-year $600,000 deal. Evaluating Cloudflare versus other leading zero trust solutions, they judged our products to be richer, more flexible, more scalable and easier to deploy. They also appreciated our integrated approach, providing a single platform to solve their broad set of network security, performance and reliability needs. A Fortune 500 retailer adopted cloud floor workers to build scalable online retail applications ahead of Black Friday. They're using durable objects to manage what they anticipate will be extremely high traffic volumes this holiday seen. They appreciate our customizability and effortless scalability. They've stress-tested their application with over 100,000 transactions per second and workers handled it without breaking a sweat. They signed a $200,000 annual deal, and we anticipate the account will grow significantly as they move more of their online retail application onto our platform. The Middle Eastern financial services provider signed a three-year $600,000 deal. They appreciated our global network with locations across the Middle East and our ability to deliver services that kept their sensitive customer data local in the regions they serve. Handling data locality requirements is one of the superpowers of edge computing over traditional cloud. The customer has already become a champion to other enterprises in the region. A national airline send a $180,000 contract for our Cloudflare One services. They appreciate the better accuracy and lower false positive rate of our security products. This is a customer that we started talking to right near the beginning of COVID, while our sales cycles are usually very fast, still typically less than a quarter. This one was slow as they are in an industry that was highly impacted by the pandemic, but I highlighted as a deal we won in Q3 because I think it shows light at the end of the tunnel, even highly coded impacted industries like airlines are starting to return to normal. And as they do, they're once again calling us to help with their network security, reliability and performance needs. If I step back, I will note that Q3 2021 was different in many ways in Q3 2020. While last year, the seasonality of summer seemed to disappear as people canceled vacations and worked without a break. This year, much of the world came out of lockdown in a parent desperate need of a vacation. July and August were quieter than normal and the quarter ended up being more back-end loaded than we usually see. Talking with peer companies and listening to earnings calls over the last two weeks, we don't believe there was anything about that unique to us. But refresh from a much-needed holiday, IT organizations now seem to have returned ready to roll up their sleeves and modernize their stacks for a post-COVID world. October started out very strong. In just the first week, a prominent social network chose Cloudflare One as their Zero Trust solution, finding a contract worth at least $1 million annually. That same week, one of the largest video conferencing services came under attack and onboarded onto Cloudflare, signing an $8 million annual deal. They push a lot of traffic, and we believe we are the only network provider with its scale and agility to have been able to onboard them over a weekend. And the coolest part, we not only mitigated the attacks, but their network performance actually improved. On top of that, we're confident, over time, we'll save them more in other providers' network bandwidth fees and we charge them ourselves, which is a totally magical experience and the recipe for a very sticky customer relationship. We have no intention of slowing down, and I wanted to thank all the teams working hard to help our customers build our business and live up to our mission of helping build a better Internet. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas to walk through the numbers. Thomas, take it away. Yes. I'll start, Matt, and then Thomas can weigh in with some more. So I think that success often is a combination of doing lots of things well. And we really have continued to march upmarket to larger and larger customers over time. So I think a couple of things are true. One, as we have successfully launched more and more products, we're seeing those products attach to our existing customers. And so about half of the customers that are new, large customers are existing customers that spend more with us and grow into that category. But the other half our new customers are totally new logos to us. And I think that is both our success of building out our sales team and our go-to-market motion, where increasingly, we have absolutely top-notch field sellers with relationships to sell into those larger and larger accounts. And we're seeing success in going upmarket. I think that what we want to deliver and what we're building, if you fast forward 10 years from now, it's going to look like a traditional enterprise sales team, what's different about how we're building that is, as we've always said, that we get to invest behind the demand, not in front of it. And I think that the difference is that makes it less likely that we make a mistake as we continue to move upmarket. In terms of the competitive landscape, I don't think we've seen a significant change. I think our win rates across competitors continue to be very attractive and improving. We still think that there are a whole bunch of legacy hardware boxes that are out there that we are replacing. And I think we're on the right side of history. And so more and more customers are turning to us. I think the last thing is that COVID was a real wake-up call for IT organizations. And what I hear over and over again from the largest companies, even folks that were very cloud reticent in the past is that they never want to live through something like that again. And so organizations that might have been hesitant to use a service like Cloudflare now see us as a no-brainer. And so I think while COVID was difficult insofar as IT organizations really battened down the hatches and shut things down. I think what we're seeing now is that people are coming out the other side, people are saying, okay, I need to embrace the cloud. I need to embrace a service like Cloudflare. And I think we're in a unique time where everyone is taking our phone calls. Yes. So R2 for those who might not be following along as closely as Matt is our object store. And if you think about what are the key components of being a cloud provider, you have to have compute, but you have to have a way also of storing data. And some of those things are databases, which we're building out in various ways. Some of those are also ways that you store objects. So those are like files that would be at the edge. And because of where we sit, where we are the network in front of many of the largest cloud providers customers, we were able to really study how customers were using various cloud providers. And we came to the conclusion that the right thing for us on our product road map was to build an object store. And one of the things that is unique about where we sit versus some of the more traditional and legacy cloud providers is that because we are distributed at the edge, it allows us to be significantly more efficient in the bandwidth usage that we have. And so while typical cloud providers have to pay a series of middlemen to deliver from Ashburn, Virginia to the other side of the earth, we are already on the other side of the earth, and we have usually a direct connection to all of those other networks that are there, which means that we have an inherent competitive advantage in terms of the cost of bandwidth delivery that we can provide. And so we see that because of the fact that we have that attractive pricing, we should be passing that on to customers, and we're excited for building out R2 and seeing how that further enhances our workers' platform, which every day, people are building more and more complicated applications on. And I think this is going to allow that to just accelerate. Alex, that's a mouthful of things to go through. We had an entire week of announcements, and I think you just listed all of them for me to summarize. But let me start. So I think that it's early days in terms of R2. But what I think that we hope is that R2 can be very disruptive in the market and not only allow us to capture more of the object store spend, but also put downward pressure on all of the different cloud providers to eliminate their egress fees. It is completely absurd that these companies are charging nothing to send data to them, but then charging what can be massive markups, 80x what the wholesale price is to take data back out. And we don't think that's sustainable, and we want to push that down. The reason why that's attractive to us is we think that our long-term opportunity is really to be the fabric that connects together the various cloud providers. And in an ideal world, what we hear from customers is that they want to use some cloud flare services, but they want to use Google services and Microsoft services and Amazon services and pick the best of what they need across all of those different providers in order to deliver a more robust application. And I think that is the inevitable way that the market will play out over time and that being that fabric that can connect those different networks together is a very powerful position for us to be in. And so R2 is both, I think, an opportunity for us to grow TAM, but it's also an opportunity for us to accelerate what I think is the inevitable next generation of the cloud, which is allowing customers to pick the best of breed across multiple clouds. And I'm optimistic that across the entire industry, if we really do encourage competition on a feature-by-feature basis. And we don't lock customers in, in artificial ways like charging for egress but not in grass, that actually will expand the TAM of the entire cloud industry. And so I'm bullish on kind of everyone who's in the space. On the rest of the announcement, e-mail is one of those areas that we've been asking that customers have been asking us for, for quite some time. I think it's stagnated as a solution. And so we think that with the network that we have and the data that we see across all of what we provide in terms of our DNS service as well as our other services that we'll be able to provide a really outstanding product around that. One of the things that we're hearing from customers, they're particularly excited about is really a mix of our browser isolation technology with an e-mail security product. Imagine, for instance, if you can make sure that any link that is in an e-mail didn't actually get executed on your local computer, but instead got executed in an isolated browser, which was running out at our edge. We have all the components to be able to do that. And if you look back at all of the security incidents that have happened across the space, that one technology closes the biggest hole in most enterprise IT spaces. So it's an area that we think is extremely exciting. Clapper offices is our announcement about putting our equipment in starting with about 1,000 of the most populated and most traffic office buildings in the world. And we think that, that just is an easier on-ramp to get customers onto our network. And one of the things that we're particularly excited about with that is that we can actually create an MPLS replacement to connect various branch offices together, but do it in a way which is almost instantaneous to turn up, whereas you usually have to wait weeks or months to get a private network like that turned up otherwise. And I think that what we announced around Web 3.0 and the crypto space again, I think that we want to be the bridge between what was the traditional web and what may be coming with Web 3.0. And we've been investing in this space for quite some time. I think we don't know exactly where it's going to go, and I don't think anyone necessarily does. But we have a really brilliant team that's thinking about this, and we want to be positioned that if it does become the next thing that Cloudflare helps provide the rails to make sure that Web 3.0 works as well as some of the optimistic forecasts suggest it could. So again, I think that if you're not following our blog, if you're not following our innovation weeks and you're interested in Cloudflare, we try to make these announcements as accessible as possible. And we try to make lots and lots of bets. We don't know that all of them are going to be homeruns. But if you look back in the history of birthday weeks, things like Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects were products that we announced during that time, and those have then subsequently become very significant lines of business for us. Well, again, I think we are focused on how we can be the network that any company plugs into and literally doesn't have to worry about anything else. Yes. Thanks, Shaul. I think Magic Transit is really one of our key winners. And I think it's been a very easy product for our existing sales team to sell to our existing customers. And so a number of the wins that I highlighted in the quarter, including the pharmaceutical company, the Fortune 500 manufacturing company, they are adopting Magic Transit as part of the overall bundle. But I think the thing that I'm hearing more and more is that customers are increasingly not seeing us as providing one single point solution or one single feature, but that we have earned being a platform to provide an overall solution to, again, be that network that customers can plug into and not have to worry about anything else. And so Magic Transit is part of a lot of these deals. It becomes very sticky as part of it. We think that, that will further accelerate with what we're doing for Cloudflare for offices. And again, it's been a very natural addition to sell to our existing customer base. The deal that I highlighted that happened early in Q4, the large video conferencing service. And that was in fact, when we were designing Magic Transit, we said one day, if we build this right, this particular customer would be able to sign up and not only would be able to help them protect them from a security perspective, but we'd also be able to actually accelerate their traffic. And that's exactly what ended up happening. The customer came under an attack. We were able to very quickly onboard them in their time of need. They have a global customer base themselves, and they were very pleasantly surprised when not only were we able to stop the attack, but that their own internal measurement, the performance got better. That's why we call Magic Transit as magic is it really does for customers feel like magic. Off the charts. I mean, I think that we were surprised by how much it resonated across the customer base. We usually, during these innovation weeks, see an uptick in our inbound interest. But in terms of the organic leads that we saw, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw a tenfold, so 10x increase in the number of organic inbound interest. And I think it points to that customers, whether they're small or large, feel like the egress fees that they're being charged by the sort of legacy cloud providers are agreed to, and they're looking for a solution. And if we can help provide that, I think that's a very exciting opportunity for us. Yeah, Keith. So first of all, I noticed your question to Satya, which sounded like it was about us you didn't name drop us. So you're a little bit... Well, I appreciate it. And again, you can't be too much in the dog as if you're so question number four. So we're constantly adjusting how our sales team works. And so for instance, it used to be that our solutions engineering team was both presale and post-sale. Now we have specialized teams that are different for presale and post-sale. And that's an adjustment that's come over time. I think that we have specialists in individual products that specialize in various areas, and we have internal training to make sure that our sales enablement is strong across our team. And so as we continue to go upmarket that requires a different sales motion and a different type of seller, and we are amazed that over the last 12 months, we've had nearly 0.25 million people apply to work at Cloudflare, which is just astonishing. And so if you look across that, about half of those applicants are for our go-to-market team and the caliber and quality of the people that we're getting is great. And so as we continue to build that out, we will continue to not believe that what we did yesterday is the solution for what we need to do tomorrow and both hire a different type of sales person to service larger customers and then also have specialization across it. One thing I think that is interesting internally that we do is a lot of these new products come out of a group that we call ETI, which stands for emerging technology and incubation. And that group, their goal is to take lots of shots on goal and launch lots of products. And then when a product takes off like a workers or a team when it's the right time, those products then graduate to our more traditional product and engineering group. And the EPI Group does have a small go-to-market team that helps with these new functions, kind of write the initial playbook and certain products like Magic Transit are a very easy add-on to our existing customer base, something like Teams is actually sometimes is a different buyer. And so we're having to figure out how to navigate horizontally inside organizations. And as I highlighted in one of the examples, more and more, we're building the relationship with the C-level executives so that we have that executive sponsorship. And again, you've got to do multiple things right in order to continue to execute the way we are. And so what our sales team will look like and what our go-to-market team will look like in five years will be very different than it is now. But I think it's a very natural progression from where we are now to where we're going. Thanks, Jim. So when we launched the company, there were really three pillars that were the kind of core values at Cloudflare in terms of sort of how we thought about products. We thought about how do we build products that make you more secure, how we build products that make you more reliable and how do we build products that make you fast. And that whenever we think about products, we're thinking about how we can do one or more of those things. I think what's become clear over the last four years has been there are two additional things. we would add to that list. One is efficiency. So how do we build products that help customers save money and really just have a very clear ROI for them. And then the last is privacy, where we have never and we will never sell our customers' data or our customers' customers' data. And so I think that, that has made it very easy for us to commit to the privacy regulations that are springing up around the rest of the world and to be thinking about our products in ways to build them to comply with those regulations. And so I see that there are a number of customers, so for example, the Middle Eastern bank that I highlighted in the prepared remarks, they really appreciated the fact that we have locations in the markets that they service and that we could help them keep their data there so that they would comply with what are, again, the regulations that come out of this privacy landscape. And so I think because of the fact that it's been very easy for us to be privacy first. And that's something that none of the other cloud providers have. They all have advertising businesses attached to them in one way or another. We are very clean in that sense. And so it has allowed us to be a great partner to organizations that do believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. And so I think that, that's something that is very much aligned across our business. And I think we don't exactly know where that will go. But I think that if you had to bet that being on the more private side of the Internet is being on the right side of history. Yes. So, I'll predict that the sleeper announcement from our birthday week that might be the most impactful to our business, over the course of the next 10 years will be cloud suffer offices. And what we have seen is that the excitement from landlords and real estate groups about being able to offer Cloudflare services to their tenants is much higher than we actually expected, not only at the time of the announcement, but then subsequently. What it really offers is an ability for any tenant to plug into our network and be able to yet have fast connection to the Internet, but also get all the security, reliability and efficiency gains that we deliver. And so I think that the ramp of that is designed very much to be driven by where customer demand comes from. We have secured the ability to have access to a very large number of the office buildings and to be able to get connectivity from those office buildings out to the rest of the world. But I think that there's an opportunity that if we execute on the vision that we outlined that Cloudflare may well have one of, if not the largest backbone network across the entire Internet. And I think, again, that continues to execute on our vision of how can we be the fabric that connects all of these different services together with the ability to be programmable and have security built in. Sort of, again, what we say our mission is to help build a better Internet. And at some level, what we're doing is thinking about, gosh, if we all knew what the Internet was going to become, and we had a time machine to go back 40 years and say, do it differently. I mean, Cloudflare is time machine. And we continue to think about how can we make the Internet itself fundamentally better and deliver real value to our customers. So I'm extremely excited about Cloudflare offices. Watch this space, because I think there are going to be a lot of exciting partnerships as we bring that forward. And then it will be something that we can deliver real value to customers around the world. Trevor, thanks for the question. In almost all of those cases, those were competitive deals that were coming through either an RFP or RFI process or they were even if it wasn't a formal RFP or RFI process, there were other names that were providing more limited sets of Zero Trust features. And what we are seeing is that we are winning in those competitive head-to-head deals because, first of all, we are significantly easier to deploy and implement Secondly, we have a richer feature set especially when you take into account the entire platform. Third, we deliver significantly higher ROI for the investment that's there. And then fourth, there's a natural integration across the entire network that is provided. So I think that this is obviously a newer area that we have gotten into. But I am very proud of our team and the win rates that we have against some better known vendors in the Zero Trust space, and I think that there is a very big opportunity for us to continue to deliver because, again, we've built a platform that can scale in a way that I don't think that any other Zero Trust vendor has. Sure. So I can take that. As we talked about last quarter, along with Accenture, we're able to secure a big deal across the business. We don't anticipate, as we said last time, that will have a material impact on revenues until 2022, but that is going very well. And I think that what we're seeing is more and more agencies within the federal business are excited to work with us. We also anticipate that early in 2022, we will reach our moderate full FedRAMP compliance. We're already able to with the achievement that we have sell into the federal government under the provisional compliance that we have in place. And so I think that, that puts us in place to be able to deliver that. And we're hiring right now to be able to build out our federal team to be able to handle what we anticipate will be strong demand. Yes, Jim, I think that channel is something that has been part of our mix for quite some time, but is not yet at the place where we think there's an opportunity for it to be. And so channel has always been a challenge for SaaS companies. And I think historically, One of the problems for channel partners with us was for a lot of our traditional products, it took 5 minutes to onboard. And so there wasn't a lot of value to add for a value-added reseller. But I think what you're seeing is as our products are getting more sophisticated, that channel partners are able to really create value in specialization and customization for that. So you see how that with Accenture, which we went to market with, obviously, on the large end of that, we have had a long-term channel partnership relationship with IBM, which has been very successful for us. But I think that expanding our use of the channel in 2022 is one of the focus areas. And I agree with you that that's an area where we can get even further leverage in our go-to-market spend. Yes, Andrew. So we are a proxy. I think sometimes people think that because we started out what's known in the industry as a reverse proxy that we aren't that we can't be a forward proxy, but it turns out that it's as easy to make the traffic flow one way through the pipe as it is to make it flow the other way through the pipe. And so what's really powerful is because we not only built that proxy infrastructure, and we are in more than 250 cities worldwide. We have an incredible amount of capacity and scalability. And we have all of the existing security features built in that I think that our proxy when it's compared head to head with some of the other providers, shines both on a performance perspective, where we actually usually will accelerate customers' traffic, whereas other solutions typically slow it down. And then also on a broad security threat basis, where we're increasingly seeing attackers launch things like denial of service attacks and the traditional providers just don't have the capacity to be able to stay ahead of that, whereas we do because that's part of what has been our more historic product. I think what we are building out is actually more of the clients that exist on individual devices to augment the proxy services. And so the great news for that for us is that because we've had consumer-facing products like Cloudflare One, we have the world's biggest QA organization, where there are literally tens of millions of people using Wharf every day, taking the tires and making sure that it works well, not only on desktops and laptops, but on really difficult environments like mobile phones, where usually competitive solutions will massively burn battery life or decrease performance. So I think that we are very well positioned to be able to win that space. I think our challenge is just making sure that there's awareness and that we really refine our go-to-market motion. But we're seeing success and we're seeing wins. And when we go head to head with some of the other competitors out there, I really like our win rates. Well, the interest - so, we're focused on the present and focused on building solutions for companies that exist today and problems that exist today. And so we have an internal rule that anyone who mentions driverless cars when talking about Cloudflare Workers has to do a shot. And so I think that I would rather bet on applications that exist today. And what we're seeing, for example, from the very large retailer that's concerned about the traffic volumes of our Black Friday, we're building a solution that easily scaled to them to over 100,000 requests per second. If you do the math out on that, that is across one customer well over $1 trillion requests per quarter. And we see nearly $1 trillion request per day from the users of Workers. So our ability to scale and deliver real applications has really been built over the fact that we had that product in market for the last four years. And as we add things like a R2, I think it just continues to make it a richer platform and that we're seeing real large retailers, financial services, health care, adopt. And someday, driverless cars use it too, that's great. But in the meantime, we'll focus on real problems at the moment. If AWS takes egress fees to 0 tomorrow, I will do a dance of joy for all of our mutual customers. And that will put us in a position, I think, of finally realizing what is the ultimate opportunity of the cloud, which is how do we allow customers to take advantage of the best of what Amazon offers the best of what Google offers the best of what Microsoft offers the best of what Oracle offers and the best of what cloud player offers. And if we can be the fabric that connects all of that together, that's great. In the meantime, because I don't think that AWS is going to take egress fees to 0 tomorrow. We're going to make products that perform at least as well as theirs do, but don't rate customers over the coals for what our agreed or egress fees. So I hope that your hypothetical comes true. I think it's unlikely that it would, but that would be a great thing for customers. And I think it would force us to continue to innovate in that space, just like it would force everyone else to innovate in the space and who wins in that case as customers. Again, I think the good - taking the second part of the question first. The good news is we've made substantial CapEx investments around the world. And the efficiency of running an edge network like ours is actually substantially lower CapEx versus traditional centralized cloud providers. We get the benefits of taking advantage of the entire Internet and the routing system around the world and then can put data wherever it makes the most sense for customers and store it there. So we've got substantial storage and compute capacity across our entire network. One of the things that was important about the fact that we started out very much as a security company, is that security applications require significant compute. And so we have actually deployed unlike some of the more point CDN solutions. When you look at our nodes, they're very heavy on compute. And that's part of why we've been able to scale up our computing solution as quickly as possible. They also have a ton of disc in them. And so that means that there's storage that we can provide in those locations. We're confident that we can provide the R2 service in a way that has very attractive economics for us. And we're also confident in part because our infrastructure team has gotten so good at building to the capacity that we need, that if we do see demand, which is significant that we will be able to invest in CapEx behind that demand. So I don't think that as a percentage of revenue R2 meaningfully changes our CapEx spend. But if it is wildly successful, our CapEx might go up, but that would be correlated with our revenue going up. Does that make sense in answering your question? Thank you. I appreciate everyone at Cloudflare for the hard work of delivering what really was a milestone quarter for us. We are incredibly proud of achieving profitability. And I just wanted to repeat one more time what I said what Thomas said, which is we are nowhere near out of ideas of things to build and customers sell them to. And so we are going to continue to reinvest our profits back into the business in order to build what we really believe is going to be one of the truly iconic technology companies. Thank you all for being investors. Thank you for tuning in. We'll see you next quarter."

Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jason. We had our strongest quarter as a public company. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $152 million, up 53% year-over-year. Our revenue growth continue to accelerate as we saw strength across all customer segments. In particular, we added a record of 143 large customers those that pay out more than $100,000 per year and ended the quarter with 1088 large customers, 19% of the Fortune 1000 are now paying by their customers and we continue to see particular strength across our enterprise business. Our expansion rate also improved over Q1 with dollar based net retention reaching a 124% in Q2, even the strong revenue and customer growth, our gross margin improved to 78%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. If there were a theme for the quarter, it was Cloudflare winning the business as the largest and most sophisticated companies and organizations in the world. To that end, I wanted to jump right in and highlight some customer wins, starting with the world's largest IT buyer. The United States federal government chose Cloudflare's Zero Trust solutions in order to help secure federal agencies against the rising threat of cyber attacks. We partnered with Accenture Federal Services and won a contract with the Department of Homeland Security to offer our protection to all civilian executive branch agencies. This is a very competitive process where we are up against nearly every other vendor in the space. Our win highlights how our Zero Trust solutions are now recognized as world class. This is also a good example of how we're increasingly working with leading GSIs like Accenture, as we service larger and larger organizations and there aren't many organizations larger than the United States government. While we are proud of this deal and the credibility it gives us as a leader in the Zero Trust space and we believe it will ultimately be a significant contributor to revenue, we don't believe that the contribution will be meaningful in 2021. As a result, this deal along with some other strategic deals we won in the quarter, do not show up in RPO and we have not included the impact of them in our guidance through the end of the year. However, servicing a large customer like the United States government as well as other strategic deals we won in Q2 does require us to increase investments in our network. Anticipating these deals, we began making increased investments in Q1. These investments continued in Q2 and we anticipate will continue through the second half of the year. We are investing for the long-term and we believe winning strategic customers proves how this strategy continues to pay off. Even with the initial investment, we still anticipate we will reach breakeven in Q1 of 2022. While we're on the topic of profitability I wanted to preview a conversation, I anticipate having with some of you this time next year. As part of our long-term model, we have an operating margin target of 20%. When we say long-term, we really mean it. We remain confident in our ability to reach that long-term target, but we are not in a rush to get there. From the point at which we reach breakeven, we intend to aggressively reinvest excess gross profit back into growth. We are nowhere close to being out of ideas for new products to build for customers to buy them. Cloudflare is optimized for innovation and we plan to continue to launch new products, add more customers relentlessly execute and reinvest in growth for the foreseeable future. Security continued to be in the news and was a theme driving customer wins. A major oil and gas pipeline provider signed a $210,000 annual contract for a portion of our Cloudflare One solution. They were looking to help protect their infrastructure against the sophisticated cyber attacks they were facing. They were referred to us by a major system integrator and together we help better protect their critical infrastructure. I think this is evident that when companies and their advisers face cybersecurity challenges Cloudflare is increasingly one of their first phone calls. A Fortune 500 transportation provider signed a three-year $340,000 contract for a portion of our Cloudflare One solution. This is another deal that came to us through a channel partner. We believe there's an opportunity to more than double the size of our relationship with this customer over the coming year. A Fortune 500 industrial services provider signed a two-year $895,000 deal for a number of Cloudflare One components. This customer was targeted by the so-called fancy Lazarus hacker group. We were able to enable our solution with spend four hours of our first conversation and mitigate the threat. A Fortune 500 auto parts manufacturing company faced a similar threat and turned to us to solve it. They signed a $300,000 annual deal. The CISO said, the Cloudflare team was fantastic. We took this threat very seriously. Cloudflare is there for us. You can't make a car with only 99% of the parts. So one malicious attack in the supply chain impacts everyone. In that spirit, he referred us to another Fortune 500 manufacturing company who signed a two-year $320,000 contract. The CISO of that second firm referred us to a third Fortune 500 manufacturing firm who signed a two-year $570,000 contract. That's over $1 million new contracts because our solutions work and solve some of the problems that are top of mind for every technology leader right now. It increasingly feels like Cloudflare's becoming the de facto choice for enterprises and they are thinking about the future of their network security. A Fortune 500 born on the web e-commerce provider expanded their use of Cloudflare. They were already using our WAF and content delivery products. Their team turned to us when they were looking for a developer-friendly Zero Trust security solution. In a competitive process with other Zero Trust vendors, we won this technically sophisticated customers business. In the process, they also went all in on that making up their exclusive provider of network services. This win shows how we can expand customers from using one of our products to being their complete secure programmable network provider. This customer's spend with us is now over $4 million annually and we expect we will grow with them. A very large cryptocurrency exchange expanded the use of our network. As an exchange, they are assessed with the fastest possible performance. They leaned heavily on our Argo smart routing technology as well as our global presence in more than 200 cities worldwide. They expanded their contract with us in the quarter and now spend over $4 million annually. It's also of note that three of the four largest cryptocurrency exchanges use Cloudflare's network to be fast and secure. We see more and more customers building applications around Cloudflare workers our compute platform. A high-profile new economy delivery company signed a $1.3 million three-year deal. We use a number of our products, but increasingly are building their application using Workers in order to get fast scalable performance. They appreciate the flexibility it provides, as they literally deliver for their geographically distributed customer base. A financial services software provider signed a three-year $3.3 million deal for a number of our products. They're using Workers as a hyper programmable middleware to stitch together multiple vendor solutions. They love how easy it is for developers on their team to get up and running on the platform, because of the broad programming language support and rich developer tools that have been honed and battle tested in production since Workers launched nearly four years ago. An Asian fintech provider expanded their use of Cloudflare by $0.5 million, making their annual spend now $1.3 million. They are using Workers to accelerate their development cycle and replace spend with some of the traditional hyperscale compute providers. They cited Workers' ease of use and global performance as key drivers of their decision to double down on Cloudflare. From old-school manufacturing and cryptocurrency, from the United States government to some of the largest companies in the world, I was particularly struck this quarter how Cloudflare's resonating across industry segments and geographies as the answer whenever someone is looking for the future of a secure programmable network. Finally, I wanted to make sure you all had a chance to catch our announcement last week. We have a tradition of hosting innovation weeks, where we launch new products and features. We typically host about eight of these weeks per year. Last week was our first Impact Week. During the week we highlighted Project Pangea which provides Internet connectivity at no cost to underserved communities worldwide. A number of initiatives to drive down Cloudflare's environmental impact and help our customers cut their carbon output, our commitment to human rights, a sustainable workforce and our vision for a more inclusive future work. What I really like about these efforts is that they aren't ancillary. They are core to who we are and what we do as a company. We deeply believe in our mission of helping build a better Internet. And living that every day shows up in the continued success of winning customers and attracting and retaining the incredible team we have. Thank you to all of them for what was an outstanding quarter. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas to walk through the financials.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We continued the momentum from the first quarter and saw new records in both dollar-based net retention and large customer additions. Our success in the first half of this year is due in part to the investments we made last year, benefiting from our ability to successfully ramp product innovation and go-to-market employees in a work from anywhere world. We firmly believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver consistent results with disciplined execution. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 53% year-over-year to $152.4 million. The growth in revenue was driven by another quarter of strong customer demand, both in terms of new local acquisition, as well as expansion within our existing customer base. From a geographic perspective, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 65% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 53% year-over-year. APAC represented 15% of revenue and increased 23% year-over-year. We were pleased to see revenue continue to accelerate in the U.S. this quarter, while we continue to ramp our go-to-market international footprint. In China, we are pleased to see the transition of customers from Baidu to JD progressing well. In addition network performance metrics of JD have already served past historical performance in China, due to expanded network coverage and streamlined equation. Turning to our customer metrics. We exited the quarter with 126,735 paying customers, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. We saw a record number of large customer additions in the second quarter, adding 143 large customers sequentially and 451 year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 1,088 large customers, representing an increase of 71% year-over-year. We saw a significant expansion from our large customers, which helped to drive a record dollar-based net retention rate of 124%, representing an increase of 100 basis points sequentially. We are encouraged to see our customer acquisition costs continue to trend favorably this quarter giving us confidence to continue to invest in our large enterprise go-to-market activities. Second quarter gross margin was 78%, representing an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 6% of revenue in the second quarter. We continue to expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue for fiscal 2021. Turning to the operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and decreased 5% year-over-year to 81%. We had another strong hiring quarter with an increase of 34% year-over-year bringing our total number of employees to approximately 2050 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $68.4 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially and decreased to 45% from 48% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $30.1 million in the quarter. R&D, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 1% sequentially and year-over-year to 20% from 21%. General and administrative expenses were $24.4 million for the quarter. G&A, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 1% sequentially and year-over-year to 16% from 17%. We continue to see strong operating leverage in the second quarter with operating margin improving 690 basis points year-over-year. Operating loss was $4 million compared to $9.5 million in the same period last year. Net loss in the quarter was $7.3 million or a net loss per share of $0.02. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was negative 26%. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $9.8 million or 6% of revenue compared to negative $20.2 million or 20% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was positive $7.5 million in the second quarter or 5% of revenue, which decreased $16 million sequentially and increased $2.5 million year-over-year. As we've mentioned previously, we expect to continue to see some level of variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital, the growth in our large enterprise business and seasonal factors. Remaining performance obligations or ARPU remained strong in the second quarter, coming in at $484 million, representing an increase of 10% sequentially and 77% year-over-year. Current ARPU was 77% of total ARPU. Given the strong momentum we are seeing, we remain optimistic and confident in the continued growth of our business. As such, we are pleased to once again raise our revenue outlook for both the quarter and the full year. As Matthew mentioned previously, we saw some exciting customer wins in the second quarter, which will necessitate increased investment in our network and engineering store. These wins lean heavily into the security aspect of our offering and give us a road map to further expand our platform and enhance strategic partnerships. Anticipating these deals, we began making these investments in the first quarter. These investments continued in the second quarter and we anticipate will continue through the second half of the year. Turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $165 million to $166 million, representing an increase of 45% year-over-year. Recall, in our third quarter 2020 revenue, we had a onetime benefit of $1.9 million related to a customer renewal. Without this one-time benefit, our third quarter guidance would represent an increase of 47% to 48% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $9.5 million to $8.5 million and we expect net loss per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.03 and assuming approximately 310 million common share outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of negative 15%. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $629 million to $633 million, representing an increase of 46% to 47% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $28 million to $24 million, and we expect net loss per share over the period in the range of $0.12 to $0.11, assuming approximately 309 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2021 of negative 19%. In closing, we completed another very strong quarter. As Matthew mentioned, we also launched our first Impact Week last week. I encourage everyone to take a look at our Impact website where we centralized ESG disclosures and highlight sustainability initiatives. We also published our first greenhouse gas emission report, our first diversity report, and our commitment to not only 100% renewable energy, but also removing all of our historic emissions affiliated with powering our network by 2025. We're excited to continue to expand our sustainability efforts, which not only tightly aligns with our mission but also strengthens the durability of our business and is additive to the financial work of Cloudflare. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a really strong quarter here. Matthew, it's clear that the large federal deal stood out to me and is impressive, because I think you've hit some additional levels of FedRAMP certification, but you're still pretty early in your Fed or public sector journey. Can you talk a little bit more about, I guess how extensive the public sector just in general all the way down to state and local governments could be for you guys? And how are you putting more resources behind that? It seems like you talked about GSIs, but just a little bit more on that increasing opportunity.\nMatthew Prince: Sure Matt. As you mentioned, we are in the process of getting our FedRAMP certification and we anticipate that in the first half of next year will be fully FedRAMP certified, but we're already in the marketplace since we're going through the process, and it's going very smoothly and we anticipate that that will go -- continue to go well. We have always had a broad set federal customers. The FBI has been a customer for a long time, the U.S. State Department, Library of Congress and a number of others. And I think that's because when some of the most sophisticated organizations in the world look at -- that are under constant threat look at the solutions that are out there, they increasingly understand and have for quite some time that we're the best solution for stopping the cyber threats that they face. And so I think that there is a significant opportunity. We are investing both in terms of partnerships with GSIs like, Accenture but then also building out our own team to be able to just -- to be able to service that. And I think over the last 10 years, we've done a terrific job of building relationships with the people that are really leading the cybersecurity efforts in the US federal government and that's now really paying off. One of the things that's important about us and one of the reasons why this is important is Cloudflare fundamentally is the foundation, on top of which a number of other companies build their products. And so as other companies are looking for companies that they can trust these wins we see resonating across the entire industry. And again I'm really proud of our team for the success that we've had selling our Zero Trust solution to what is literally the biggest IT buyer in the world.\nMatt Hedberg: That's fantastic. And then Thomas, I think the other thing that\u2019s certainly, 71% growth in large deals and a record add was impressive. Can you talk about the success of bundling? I know some of your bigger customers are taking 10 or more products. But just thoughts on leveraging bundles. And I guess maybe Callon in particular. I know it was introduced last year but how successful is that in driving some of this momentum in large enterprise wins?\nThomas Seifert: You heard from Matthew, that he you picked out a couple of deals during the quarter that were Cloudflare one or in part Cloudflare one. So as we migrate in our evolution the product portfolio becomes broader and deeper the bundling of products and the pricing of those bundles becomes a huge opportunity for us. It's one of the more strategic, important projects that we are currently running within Cloudflare Michelle and I do in order to get more sophistication into our approach. If you look at companies we admire like Salesforce and Microsoft it has been a big part of their journey going up and getting to larger accounts and larger revenue commitments per customers getting more sophisticated in the bundling effort. And we increased 124% of dollar net retention happened primarily because we were really successfully expanding large customers and especially with bundled deals. So we are making good progress, but it's still a huge opportunity in front of us too.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Thomas, many have asked just in the second half the guidance is implying a pretty significant deceleration. Is there anything that we should keep in the in mind in terms of modeling other than the bigger comps that you're coming up on?\nThomas Seifert: Brent, you have to keep in mind as I said in my remarks before we -- the third quarter last year was driven by a onetime customer renewal So if you were to take this into account the guidance is now getting up to 46% to 47% year-over-year is probably the strongest guidance we have given in our life as a public company from a growth expectation perspective but it also served us well so far to be prudent in how we think about our future and where the -- the headwinds and tailwinds that we have. And this guidance is consistent with our growth over the last eight quarters taking everything into account that we know and making sure we continue to be thoughtful.\nBrent Thill: And a quick follow-up for Matthew, maybe from your perspective something that maybe we all can't see that you're seeing that you're particularly surprised or proud about that maybe just didn't come through in the financials is there one or two things that are really surfacing that are maybe surprising given you as architecting the leadership of this move?\nMatthew Prince: I think I'll come back to the team that we have and the strength that we're seeing across applicants for that team. I think across the industry, there are a lot of people as we come out of the other end of COVID who are thinking about, what it is that they can do with their career. Everyone who gets a job at Cloudflare, can work a bunch of other places. And yet we continue to see both the retention of our current team exceed what our expectations are but also just the caliber and quality of people across not just our R&D organization but in the sales and marketing organization. And I think that companies are just collections of people and so the fact that we have at this time where people are thinking about, what is it that they want to do with their career some of the best and most talented people that I've ever seen are saying \"If I can be part of helping build a better Internet that's, what I want to spend the next chunk of my career doing.\" And I think that that really sets us up well for just continuing to execute as we scale. So I'm really proud of our team and I think that it's amazing that we keep raising the bar on that team.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Jim Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. You guys clearly don't have enough confidence on your schedule coming up. But nice quarter guys, I wanted to start off with a question for Matthew really on Apple private relay that got announced, what can you say about the reports about this offering? It seems like traffic is already coming in across the cloud for this. Is that the right way to think about it? And how can a relationship like this really changed the industry dynamics in your view?\nMatthew Prince: So, Jim, we have a policy of not talking about any of our customers without their permission. And I'm certainly not going to speculate here on that. But I will tell three stories, I guess about Apple. Back in 1978, when there were two what were known as hobbyists at the time, we now call them developers. But Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had an idea to build a personal computer, they went to Venrock, which is venture capital arm with the Rockefeller family, and raised their first capital. I feel a certain kinship to that, because when Cloudflare started, we went to Venrock and they were the first capital in Cloudflare, and actually, I was hanging out with Brian Roberts, a few weeks ago, who runs that firm and he said that Cloudflare actually is the first company in the venture capital firm's history to now have surpassed the return that they had with Apple. So that's something that we're proud of. I think the second bit, which is a little bit more personal was 18 years later in 1996, I was actually in law school. And I heard that, Steve Jobs is actually coming back to Apple. And my dad at the time was a stock broker, and I worked as a ski instructor the year before and saved up a little bit of money. And so I called him and I said, I think, I want to buy 1,000 shares of Apple stock. And that turned out to be a pretty good decision, which will largely pay for my ability to among other things, I go to business school a few years later, where I met Michelle, and we were able to start Cloudflare from that. So I've been an Apple fan boy for a long time, and it's definitely a company that we really admire. The last story which is actually 19 years after that, I remember I was invited to a very small gathering of tech leaders meeting with senior government officials to talk about how technology companies can help with the fight against various law enforcement requests and terrorism. And it was a pretty incredible group. It was also around the same time Android \u2013 you know, phone was in the news about whether or not Apple would unlock that. And we were definitely the smallest company there. There were 12 tech leaders, and it was sort of the who's who of the big tech companies. And I remember, Tim Cook in this closed meeting started to talk about privacy in a way that was really clear that it came from a deep and personal place, and talk about privacy as a fundamental human right. And that was long before Apple was running commercials on TV about the importance of privacy. And so I think that's something that, they at times have gotten a little bit of a flak investors marketing, but I think I've seen from their senior leadership that that's something that they deeply care about and that's a value that we definitely share with them. And so I've been an Apple fan boy for quite some time and hopefully that's a long enough answer not answering your question.\nJim Fish: That was a good sell-side answer honestly. But as you continue to move up market, how is the engagement and go to market changing? How should we think about that evolution of Cloudflare's go to market away like moving away from that premium funnel towards the more direct large enterprises over time? Thanks guys.\nMatthew Prince: Yeah, so I don't think we've ever been sort of the traditional premium customer. We don't think of \u2013 and from time-to-time, we get great customers that come in through that free funnel. But by and large that's really \u2013 that's not the purpose of that. The purpose of that is really to be able to just innovate as quickly as we can, with such a broad set of customers, and that's paid off incredibly well. I think that, if you fast forward, 10 years from now, Cloudflare's go-to-market motion looks just like any other big enterprise company. And I think we're building that out. You heard a number of deals, where we have now named accounts, specific sales reps, increasingly an enterprise sales team, increasingly working with channel partners and systems integrators. I think, what's different about us is that, we have used data to build out our go-to-market function in the same way that we use data across our entire company. And that's allowed us to both go into new geographies and new markets and customer segments and industries and to move up in terms of servicing larger customers in a way that again, we're not here to tell you that we don't need salespeople. We believe that we do. But I think what we've been able to do is use the data from our existing customers to invest behind the demand curve rather than ahead of the demand curve. And while that gets us to the same point that any enterprise sales company gets to, I think, what it allows us to do is very relentlessly execute and make it much less likely that we make a misstep along the way.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Shaul Eyal with Cowen. Your line is open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon and congrats on the ongoing outperformance. Matthew or Thomas, thanks for the color on paying customers and the large customer addition this quarter. But can you also provide us with an update of the total customer count any relative or even concedes will be appreciated. And I have a follow-up.\nMatthew Prince: Sure. Thanks Shaul. So we're actually pausing the reporting of the total customer count this quarter, although, we're going to bring it back. As just a reminder, total customers included both free and paying customers, and throughout the quarter we saw continued strength in that. The problem was that that really sort of described the different business than we're in today. It looked at active Internet properties and really only covered those products that relied on actually having like a website. And that didn't include a lot of the new products like Cloudflare One and others. And so we don't feel like that statistic was representative. So we're pausing it. We're going to bring it back. In the meantime if you do want to continue to track something like that, there are a lot of external services that track kind of what sign-up rates are we've continued to see strength across that W3Techs report that on a month-to-month basis. And so if that's something that you want to continue to track that that would be the place that I would look to get that. And we're looking forward to bringing our total customer count back in a way that's more accurate going forward.\nShaul Eyal: Got it. Understood. And then maybe another one Matthew or Thomas. On the topic of billings versus RPO, some investors some within the investment community are using billings as the metric to track maybe as it relates to cloud where it could actually misconstrue how healthy the underlying trends are. Do you think RPO could be the preferred metric to track? What's the internal thinking on this topic?\nThomas Seifert: Yes. Let me get started here. We think that RPO is the better indicator for the health of our business. That is certainly the number we are focusing on. And as we said, it's up 77% year-over-year in the last quarter current RPO that is the RPO in the balance sheet that we recognize over the next 12 months is up north of 60%. Billings can be sometimes an arbitrary number just depending on how many billing cycles you run over a quarter. We think RPO is the better health metric for us. And that is the number that we as closely are focused on from how we run the business and how we -- what KPIs we tranche.\nShaul Eyal: Got it. Thank you. Understood. Good luck.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Drew on for Sterling. Matthew, could you expand upon your commentary surrounding the long-term investment trajectory including the time line of that and what areas you're expecting to lean into the most?\nMatthew Prince: Sure, Drew. So, two areas. Obviously, we continue to invest in our sales and marketing motion and think about how as we continue to go up market, we have the team in place to service that. And again, I think what's unique about us is that we're able to invest behind the demand. But we do believe the salespeople and we do believe that marketing matters. We will continue to invest in that because when you're servicing customers that are as large as we have they want to do that. And it also helps us as we want to expand those customers across our entire product set to have people who can be the advocates who can talk to them and be a part of that. I think the second area where we continue really to invest is in our research and development efforts. Cloudflare runs on innovation and we have designed our entire business in order to be an innovation machine. And so over the course of the year we have a number of new products that we continue to release. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. And we definitely -- what we like to do is, design the way that we think about R&D as making a number of that in the area, iterating quickly on those across our broad customer base. And then by the time something is ready for us to take it to our largest customers, it's battle-tested and something that we continue to run on. So I don't think that the formula changes. But I do think that as we get to breakeven being able to pour resources back into that if anything should just accelerate the rate at which we are able to drive real innovation across the company.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTim Horan: Thanks. Just two questions. One I think you're implying the net dollar retention can improve here. Can you talk a little bit how can you improve it still which is a pretty high number and maybe where can it go? And then secondly, some of the carriers out there are partnering with some of the cloud providers. Do you think that they can basically pivot to become a better competitor against you? And/or are you seeing anyone else out there that's really pursuing a similar strategy could be to you? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So let me take both questions and then Thomas may want to add to the first. So first of all, with carriers we work and have had partnerships with carriers for quite some time. Most of the new deployment that we go into we're deploying directly into the carriers' networks. And we have a very symbiotic relationship with them and have been able to continue to invest in that. We're able to see what the traffic flows are across public clouds and we don't see that there's much resonance for some of the carrier partnerships with the public cloud yet, but it's something that we obviously are watching closely and carefully. And I think that the opportunity that we have is to continue to be a great partner to those carriers wherever they are around the world both to deliver our services and be able to drive down our costs as we continue to build. And I apologize in the process of answering that I forgot what your first question was. But can you repeat it just quickly?\nTim Horan: Okay. That's fine. Well just to net dollar retention rate how do you prove on what's really a good number?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So again we're -- that is something that we focused on. What I love about Cloudflare is when we focus on something we're really good at improving it. I think that it's been driven by new products. And since we don't have a usage-based model where sort of revenue can trombone up and down over time but instead, we have a subscription model it really requires us to sell more products and I think that that's been a piece of it. I think going back to what Thomas spoke about earlier as the bundling opportunity that feels like the opportunity for us to be able to continue to improve that number over time. I will say that there might be some noise in the dollar-based net retention number where we definitely have worked hard to get it above 120% and we think that that's great. We're not satisfied with where it is. There may be from quarter-to-quarter a little bit of noise in that metric. But we do think that over time we can continue to improve that metric.\nTim Horan: Thank you.\nThomas Seifert: One addition maybe so it's good to keep in mind that the dollar net retention is a lagging indicator for us how we report it. So it's lagging the initiatives that we drive. We also have a pay-as-you-go business that is very important for us in terms of how we drive efficiency in the business model. But remember we always said that it's a business that is difficult to expand. So everything you see from an outperformance perspective happens with the drag of the business and is a lagging indicator to the initiatives we have started.\nOperator: Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver with Baird. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes, so in thinking about Workers you've discussed in the past I would still be emerging tech group and price for adoption compared to revenue. I'm wondering if you could provide any insights into when this might change and it's nothing specific there what kind of criteria you might be looking for and evaluating taking that to market as a more mature solution.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. So I think it's a pretty mature solution. We launched it in 2017 and it is -- we're seeing very, very, very large companies bet their businesses on workers. So I think that that -- it is a large solution. I think that what we have been hesitant to do is break out what the specific revenue is because it tends to be part of the larger component of how we're selling our solution. But we continue to see strength in workers. We see people building and not random start-ups, but really sophisticated large companies building sophisticated complicated application using Workers. And so it is already taking workloads off of the traditional public clouds and the people and the organization just find it magical. So again I think that that even at the prices that we charge for Workers today it is very margin accretive for us. And so again I think it is a competitive product. We think that being very cost-effective is important when you're selling cloud products. We don't think of ourselves as competing with other niche edge computing platforms. We think of ourselves as competing with the big public cloud platform. And so when we think about pricing we think about pricing it in a way that is competitive with those other public clouds and even at those rates again it's margin accretive for us.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-on. In terms of drivers of serverless Matthew one of the things you hit on is just the compliance to this case. And can you just touch on that a bit more if you're seeing that starting to take hold in the market yet?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So the first bit is the computing piece of edge computing is the easy piece. The hard piece of storage. And what I think you've seen us do is think through how to have distributed storage in a way that is still easy for developers to wrap their heads around and build, but at the same time gives them the flexibility where they can do things like require a piece of data, never leave a particular geography. And so I think that the regulatory environment for our customers continues to get more and more complex we're seeing a lot of attention for the regulatory concerns which are coming out of the EU. But what we hear from customers is that that's just the tip of the iceberg and places like India and Brazil and obviously China and others are also putting in place requirements that require people to keep their data from users in country in that particular region. And so I think that Workers is perfectly positioned for what is a much more complex regulatory environment. We are today in well over 100 countries worldwide. We're on a path to being in virtually every country worldwide. And what that allows us to do is, help our customers comply with these increasingly complex regulations around the world. We talked earlier about FedRAMP. Again that's very U.S.-focused. We're doing similar efforts, for example, with the German equivalent and others around the world. And again, I think, that sets us up very well to be able to satisfy the regulatory and compliance needs of many large enterprises. And it's what we keep hearing as the real killer feature that distinguishes Workers from any other computing platform.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Thanks. Matt, I just wanted to compliment you for, first, on the Hotel California Amazon data commentary on your blog. I thought it was really well done. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the developer community adoption, any change in the rates, any metrics around the size of it. Everybody focuses on the financial side of it, but I think the DevOps community integration is such a key piece. Could you talk and give us some metrics or something to qualify and quantify that please?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, sure. So, more than 50,000 developers wrote their first Workers script or code this time. And that's not signed up for an account. That's actually wrote code and deployed an application. We can -- that continues to grow over time and the retention of those developers. They don't tend to just write something and then go away, but we see them continuing to deliver more and more application and more and more sophisticated applications, as we watch what developers are building. And so, I think, when we think about the platform I completely agree with you, whoever has the most developers win, we want to make a platform which, yes, satisfies the CIO and CTO and General Counsel for its regulatory compliance. Yes, it is incredibly cost effective. Of course, it is incredibly consistent. We're already the fastest that's out there. But then we really need to continue to invest in making that -- in developing that platform's ecosystem. One of the things that I'm excited about is, well, we've largely talked about big customers here. We're increasingly seeing startups that are building entire applications from scratch on the Workers platform. And that's exciting, both because it's really just a very fervent area of excitement and it's how you build communities and build ecosystem. But it also is a great way for us to be looking out, whether or not there are really great features that maybe other companies and small companies develop that might be natural either things that we can bring into a marketplace or maybe even as potential tuck-in acquisitions that don't have the technical integration risk that would be if they were using completely different platforms. So, I'm excited about it. If you search on Twitter, if you go in our Discord channel, you'll see the developers are excited about it and again it's picking up steam.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Jim Breen with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJim Breen: Thanks for taking the questions. From some time you sort of update your -- what you guys believe is the addressable market just given sort of all the new product launches, et cetera, can you just talk about how you see that moving now? And then a little bit off of Tim Horan's question just around your existing customer base growth. Any sort of metrics there on the security side in terms of your paying customers how many products they're taking and how that's maybe changed over time? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: So, I'll take the second half of that and then Thomas can comment on the first half. So, we -- at our last Investor Day we updated that today it's north of -- I think it's 80% Tom, so correct me if I'm wrong, our customers are using four or more of our products. And that tends to be the magic number for us in terms of really having stickiness and really differentiating ourselves in the marketplace. And typically customers will span across both security but then also performance and reliability. About 50% of our revenue -- 50% of sort of the initial interest that we get comes from our security products, about 25% from performance, about 25% from reliability. But I think that that somewhat mischaracterizes what Cloudflare really is which is a platform that allows you to have all three of those things in one unified solution. So, we continue to see that customers are taking more of our products as we launch products we're really building out that engine makes it so that we can very quickly our new products into our existing customer base and have them adopted. And that -- again, I think that that is -- it is very difficult to compete with us once we get customers to understand the power of using the broad platform that we have.\nThomas Seifert: Yes, I wouldn't want to disclose any new additional data. But I think the point that Matthew just made is important relating to that our ability to bundle as our product portfolio gets broader and broader our ability to customize bundles for specific customer needs and compete more effectively against point solution providers I think this is the opportunity that is there.\nMatthew Prince: And I got the -- I looked at that quickly. It's 88% of our contracted customers used four or more cloud product and 79% are five or more.\nJim Breen: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you and good afternoon guys. Matthew you mentioned Zero Trust a couple of times as driving some important wins for you this quarter. And as part of this I was wondering if Cloudflare for Teams is starting to compete on a head-to-head basis more frequently at the enterprise level.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, absolutely. I think that if you look at what for example the United States government chose and is going to be offering to all civilian federal agencies. That's a subset of the Cloudflare for Teams product in order to make sure that government workers are not targeted by malware don't fall for phishing scams. And so, we're really proud of that win. But there were many, many, many more wins where Cloudflare for Teams is going up against companies that only do that sort of Zero Trust types of solution. And our win rates are very strong. I think the place where we have really excelled is in both ease of use. And it sort of either use needs of deployment, which again I think comes from the heritage that we've always really thought about, how can, we make things incredibly easy to use. And then, secondly, we really resonate with the developer community. And so for the more technical buyers, they are -- we win those deals up, down, left, right and sideways. And I think where we continue to invest and where we will make progress is making sure that we are top right in Gartner and Forrester and all of the other analyst briefings. But again, starting with some of these great customer wins that we have is the key in order to order to be able to demonstrate that from the industry. And we think we're well on the path to being in the consideration set for anyone who is thinking about Zero Trust solutions.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. That's really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on workers, so even at its somewhat low scale today this is a very margin-accretive offering for you?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. It is margin accretive -- even at 78% gross margin.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right, terrific. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters, for any closing comments.\nMatthew Prince: We had an absolutely terrific quarter. Really appreciate all of our team, working hard to deliver the results that we have. Looking forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming shareholder and technology conferences and we're going to get back to work to helping build a better Internet. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We continued the momentum from the first quarter and saw new records in both dollar-based net retention and large customer additions. Our success in the first half of this year is due in part to the investments we made last year, benefiting from our ability to successfully ramp product innovation and go-to-market employees in a work from anywhere world. We firmly believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver consistent results with disciplined execution. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 53% year-over-year to $152.4 million. The growth in revenue was driven by another quarter of strong customer demand, both in terms of new local acquisition, as well as expansion within our existing customer base. From a geographic perspective, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 65% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 53% year-over-year. APAC represented 15% of revenue and increased 23% year-over-year. We were pleased to see revenue continue to accelerate in the U.S. this quarter, while we continue to ramp our go-to-market international footprint. In China, we are pleased to see the transition of customers from Baidu to JD progressing well. In addition network performance metrics of JD have already served past historical performance in China, due to expanded network coverage and streamlined equation. Turning to our customer metrics. We exited the quarter with 126,735 paying customers, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. We saw a record number of large customer additions in the second quarter, adding 143 large customers sequentially and 451 year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 1,088 large customers, representing an increase of 71% year-over-year. We saw a significant expansion from our large customers, which helped to drive a record dollar-based net retention rate of 124%, representing an increase of 100 basis points sequentially. We are encouraged to see our customer acquisition costs continue to trend favorably this quarter giving us confidence to continue to invest in our large enterprise go-to-market activities. Second quarter gross margin was 78%, representing an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 6% of revenue in the second quarter. We continue to expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue for fiscal 2021. Turning to the operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and decreased 5% year-over-year to 81%. We had another strong hiring quarter with an increase of 34% year-over-year bringing our total number of employees to approximately 2050 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $68.4 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially and decreased to 45% from 48% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $30.1 million in the quarter. R&D, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 1% sequentially and year-over-year to 20% from 21%. General and administrative expenses were $24.4 million for the quarter. G&A, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 1% sequentially and year-over-year to 16% from 17%. We continue to see strong operating leverage in the second quarter with operating margin improving 690 basis points year-over-year. Operating loss was $4 million compared to $9.5 million in the same period last year. Net loss in the quarter was $7.3 million or a net loss per share of $0.02. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was negative 26%. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $9.8 million or 6% of revenue compared to negative $20.2 million or 20% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was positive $7.5 million in the second quarter or 5% of revenue, which decreased $16 million sequentially and increased $2.5 million year-over-year. As we've mentioned previously, we expect to continue to see some level of variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital, the growth in our large enterprise business and seasonal factors. Remaining performance obligations or ARPU remained strong in the second quarter, coming in at $484 million, representing an increase of 10% sequentially and 77% year-over-year. Current ARPU was 77% of total ARPU. Given the strong momentum we are seeing, we remain optimistic and confident in the continued growth of our business. As such, we are pleased to once again raise our revenue outlook for both the quarter and the full year. As Matthew mentioned previously, we saw some exciting customer wins in the second quarter, which will necessitate increased investment in our network and engineering store. These wins lean heavily into the security aspect of our offering and give us a road map to further expand our platform and enhance strategic partnerships. Anticipating these deals, we began making these investments in the first quarter. These investments continued in the second quarter and we anticipate will continue through the second half of the year. Turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $165 million to $166 million, representing an increase of 45% year-over-year. Recall, in our third quarter 2020 revenue, we had a onetime benefit of $1.9 million related to a customer renewal. Without this one-time benefit, our third quarter guidance would represent an increase of 47% to 48% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $9.5 million to $8.5 million and we expect net loss per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.03 and assuming approximately 310 million common share outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of negative 15%. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $629 million to $633 million, representing an increase of 46% to 47% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $28 million to $24 million, and we expect net loss per share over the period in the range of $0.12 to $0.11, assuming approximately 309 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2021 of negative 19%. In closing, we completed another very strong quarter. As Matthew mentioned, we also launched our first Impact Week last week. I encourage everyone to take a look at our Impact website where we centralized ESG disclosures and highlight sustainability initiatives. We also published our first greenhouse gas emission report, our first diversity report, and our commitment to not only 100% renewable energy, but also removing all of our historic emissions affiliated with powering our network by 2025. We're excited to continue to expand our sustainability efforts, which not only tightly aligns with our mission but also strengthens the durability of our business and is additive to the financial work of Cloudflare. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. You heard from Matthew, that he you picked out a couple of deals during the quarter that were Cloudflare one or in part Cloudflare one. So as we migrate in our evolution the product portfolio becomes broader and deeper the bundling of products and the pricing of those bundles becomes a huge opportunity for us. It's one of the more strategic, important projects that we are currently running within Cloudflare Michelle and I do in order to get more sophistication into our approach. If you look at companies we admire like Salesforce and Microsoft it has been a big part of their journey going up and getting to larger accounts and larger revenue commitments per customers getting more sophisticated in the bundling effort. And we increased 124% of dollar net retention happened primarily because we were really successfully expanding large customers and especially with bundled deals. So we are making good progress, but it's still a huge opportunity in front of us too. Brent, you have to keep in mind as I said in my remarks before we -- the third quarter last year was driven by a onetime customer renewal So if you were to take this into account the guidance is now getting up to 46% to 47% year-over-year is probably the strongest guidance we have given in our life as a public company from a growth expectation perspective but it also served us well so far to be prudent in how we think about our future and where the -- the headwinds and tailwinds that we have. And this guidance is consistent with our growth over the last eight quarters taking everything into account that we know and making sure we continue to be thoughtful. Yes. Let me get started here. We think that RPO is the better indicator for the health of our business. That is certainly the number we are focusing on. And as we said, it's up 77% year-over-year in the last quarter current RPO that is the RPO in the balance sheet that we recognize over the next 12 months is up north of 60%. Billings can be sometimes an arbitrary number just depending on how many billing cycles you run over a quarter. We think RPO is the better health metric for us. And that is the number that we as closely are focused on from how we run the business and how we -- what KPIs we tranche. One addition maybe so it's good to keep in mind that the dollar net retention is a lagging indicator for us how we report it. So it's lagging the initiatives that we drive. We also have a pay-as-you-go business that is very important for us in terms of how we drive efficiency in the business model. But remember we always said that it's a business that is difficult to expand. So everything you see from an outperformance perspective happens with the drag of the business and is a lagging indicator to the initiatives we have started. Yes, I wouldn't want to disclose any new additional data. But I think the point that Matthew just made is important relating to that our ability to bundle as our product portfolio gets broader and broader our ability to customize bundles for specific customer needs and compete more effectively against point solution providers I think this is the opportunity that is there."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. We had our strongest quarter as a public company. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $152 million, up 53% year-over-year. Our revenue growth continue to accelerate as we saw strength across all customer segments. In particular, we added a record of 143 large customers those that pay out more than $100,000 per year and ended the quarter with 1088 large customers, 19% of the Fortune 1000 are now paying by their customers and we continue to see particular strength across our enterprise business. Our expansion rate also improved over Q1 with dollar based net retention reaching a 124% in Q2, even the strong revenue and customer growth, our gross margin improved to 78%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. If there were a theme for the quarter, it was Cloudflare winning the business as the largest and most sophisticated companies and organizations in the world. To that end, I wanted to jump right in and highlight some customer wins, starting with the world's largest IT buyer. The United States federal government chose Cloudflare's Zero Trust solutions in order to help secure federal agencies against the rising threat of cyber attacks. We partnered with Accenture Federal Services and won a contract with the Department of Homeland Security to offer our protection to all civilian executive branch agencies. This is a very competitive process where we are up against nearly every other vendor in the space. Our win highlights how our Zero Trust solutions are now recognized as world class. This is also a good example of how we're increasingly working with leading GSIs like Accenture, as we service larger and larger organizations and there aren't many organizations larger than the United States government. While we are proud of this deal and the credibility it gives us as a leader in the Zero Trust space and we believe it will ultimately be a significant contributor to revenue, we don't believe that the contribution will be meaningful in 2021. As a result, this deal along with some other strategic deals we won in the quarter, do not show up in RPO and we have not included the impact of them in our guidance through the end of the year. However, servicing a large customer like the United States government as well as other strategic deals we won in Q2 does require us to increase investments in our network. Anticipating these deals, we began making increased investments in Q1. These investments continued in Q2 and we anticipate will continue through the second half of the year. We are investing for the long-term and we believe winning strategic customers proves how this strategy continues to pay off. Even with the initial investment, we still anticipate we will reach breakeven in Q1 of 2022. While we're on the topic of profitability I wanted to preview a conversation, I anticipate having with some of you this time next year. As part of our long-term model, we have an operating margin target of 20%. When we say long-term, we really mean it. We remain confident in our ability to reach that long-term target, but we are not in a rush to get there. From the point at which we reach breakeven, we intend to aggressively reinvest excess gross profit back into growth. We are nowhere close to being out of ideas for new products to build for customers to buy them. Cloudflare is optimized for innovation and we plan to continue to launch new products, add more customers relentlessly execute and reinvest in growth for the foreseeable future. Security continued to be in the news and was a theme driving customer wins. A major oil and gas pipeline provider signed a $210,000 annual contract for a portion of our Cloudflare One solution. They were looking to help protect their infrastructure against the sophisticated cyber attacks they were facing. They were referred to us by a major system integrator and together we help better protect their critical infrastructure. I think this is evident that when companies and their advisers face cybersecurity challenges Cloudflare is increasingly one of their first phone calls. A Fortune 500 transportation provider signed a three-year $340,000 contract for a portion of our Cloudflare One solution. This is another deal that came to us through a channel partner. We believe there's an opportunity to more than double the size of our relationship with this customer over the coming year. A Fortune 500 industrial services provider signed a two-year $895,000 deal for a number of Cloudflare One components. This customer was targeted by the so-called fancy Lazarus hacker group. We were able to enable our solution with spend four hours of our first conversation and mitigate the threat. A Fortune 500 auto parts manufacturing company faced a similar threat and turned to us to solve it. They signed a $300,000 annual deal. The CISO said, the Cloudflare team was fantastic. We took this threat very seriously. Cloudflare is there for us. You can't make a car with only 99% of the parts. So one malicious attack in the supply chain impacts everyone. In that spirit, he referred us to another Fortune 500 manufacturing company who signed a two-year $320,000 contract. The CISO of that second firm referred us to a third Fortune 500 manufacturing firm who signed a two-year $570,000 contract. That's over $1 million new contracts because our solutions work and solve some of the problems that are top of mind for every technology leader right now. It increasingly feels like Cloudflare's becoming the de facto choice for enterprises and they are thinking about the future of their network security. A Fortune 500 born on the web e-commerce provider expanded their use of Cloudflare. They were already using our WAF and content delivery products. Their team turned to us when they were looking for a developer-friendly Zero Trust security solution. In a competitive process with other Zero Trust vendors, we won this technically sophisticated customers business. In the process, they also went all in on that making up their exclusive provider of network services. This win shows how we can expand customers from using one of our products to being their complete secure programmable network provider. This customer's spend with us is now over $4 million annually and we expect we will grow with them. A very large cryptocurrency exchange expanded the use of our network. As an exchange, they are assessed with the fastest possible performance. They leaned heavily on our Argo smart routing technology as well as our global presence in more than 200 cities worldwide. They expanded their contract with us in the quarter and now spend over $4 million annually. It's also of note that three of the four largest cryptocurrency exchanges use Cloudflare's network to be fast and secure. We see more and more customers building applications around Cloudflare workers our compute platform. A high-profile new economy delivery company signed a $1.3 million three-year deal. We use a number of our products, but increasingly are building their application using Workers in order to get fast scalable performance. They appreciate the flexibility it provides, as they literally deliver for their geographically distributed customer base. A financial services software provider signed a three-year $3.3 million deal for a number of our products. They're using Workers as a hyper programmable middleware to stitch together multiple vendor solutions. They love how easy it is for developers on their team to get up and running on the platform, because of the broad programming language support and rich developer tools that have been honed and battle tested in production since Workers launched nearly four years ago. An Asian fintech provider expanded their use of Cloudflare by $0.5 million, making their annual spend now $1.3 million. They are using Workers to accelerate their development cycle and replace spend with some of the traditional hyperscale compute providers. They cited Workers' ease of use and global performance as key drivers of their decision to double down on Cloudflare. From old-school manufacturing and cryptocurrency, from the United States government to some of the largest companies in the world, I was particularly struck this quarter how Cloudflare's resonating across industry segments and geographies as the answer whenever someone is looking for the future of a secure programmable network. Finally, I wanted to make sure you all had a chance to catch our announcement last week. We have a tradition of hosting innovation weeks, where we launch new products and features. We typically host about eight of these weeks per year. Last week was our first Impact Week. During the week we highlighted Project Pangea which provides Internet connectivity at no cost to underserved communities worldwide. A number of initiatives to drive down Cloudflare's environmental impact and help our customers cut their carbon output, our commitment to human rights, a sustainable workforce and our vision for a more inclusive future work. What I really like about these efforts is that they aren't ancillary. They are core to who we are and what we do as a company. We deeply believe in our mission of helping build a better Internet. And living that every day shows up in the continued success of winning customers and attracting and retaining the incredible team we have. Thank you to all of them for what was an outstanding quarter. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas to walk through the financials. Sure Matt. As you mentioned, we are in the process of getting our FedRAMP certification and we anticipate that in the first half of next year will be fully FedRAMP certified, but we're already in the marketplace since we're going through the process, and it's going very smoothly and we anticipate that that will go -- continue to go well. We have always had a broad set federal customers. The FBI has been a customer for a long time, the U.S. State Department, Library of Congress and a number of others. And I think that's because when some of the most sophisticated organizations in the world look at -- that are under constant threat look at the solutions that are out there, they increasingly understand and have for quite some time that we're the best solution for stopping the cyber threats that they face. And so I think that there is a significant opportunity. We are investing both in terms of partnerships with GSIs like, Accenture but then also building out our own team to be able to just -- to be able to service that. And I think over the last 10 years, we've done a terrific job of building relationships with the people that are really leading the cybersecurity efforts in the US federal government and that's now really paying off. One of the things that's important about us and one of the reasons why this is important is Cloudflare fundamentally is the foundation, on top of which a number of other companies build their products. And so as other companies are looking for companies that they can trust these wins we see resonating across the entire industry. And again I'm really proud of our team for the success that we've had selling our Zero Trust solution to what is literally the biggest IT buyer in the world. I think I'll come back to the team that we have and the strength that we're seeing across applicants for that team. I think across the industry, there are a lot of people as we come out of the other end of COVID who are thinking about, what it is that they can do with their career. Everyone who gets a job at Cloudflare, can work a bunch of other places. And yet we continue to see both the retention of our current team exceed what our expectations are but also just the caliber and quality of people across not just our R&D organization but in the sales and marketing organization. And I think that companies are just collections of people and so the fact that we have at this time where people are thinking about, what is it that they want to do with their career some of the best and most talented people that I've ever seen are saying \"If I can be part of helping build a better Internet that's, what I want to spend the next chunk of my career doing.\" And I think that that really sets us up well for just continuing to execute as we scale. So I'm really proud of our team and I think that it's amazing that we keep raising the bar on that team. So, Jim, we have a policy of not talking about any of our customers without their permission. And I'm certainly not going to speculate here on that. But I will tell three stories, I guess about Apple. Back in 1978, when there were two what were known as hobbyists at the time, we now call them developers. But Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had an idea to build a personal computer, they went to Venrock, which is venture capital arm with the Rockefeller family, and raised their first capital. I feel a certain kinship to that, because when Cloudflare started, we went to Venrock and they were the first capital in Cloudflare, and actually, I was hanging out with Brian Roberts, a few weeks ago, who runs that firm and he said that Cloudflare actually is the first company in the venture capital firm's history to now have surpassed the return that they had with Apple. So that's something that we're proud of. I think the second bit, which is a little bit more personal was 18 years later in 1996, I was actually in law school. And I heard that, Steve Jobs is actually coming back to Apple. And my dad at the time was a stock broker, and I worked as a ski instructor the year before and saved up a little bit of money. And so I called him and I said, I think, I want to buy 1,000 shares of Apple stock. And that turned out to be a pretty good decision, which will largely pay for my ability to among other things, I go to business school a few years later, where I met Michelle, and we were able to start Cloudflare from that. So I've been an Apple fan boy for a long time, and it's definitely a company that we really admire. The last story which is actually 19 years after that, I remember I was invited to a very small gathering of tech leaders meeting with senior government officials to talk about how technology companies can help with the fight against various law enforcement requests and terrorism. And it was a pretty incredible group. It was also around the same time Android \u2013 you know, phone was in the news about whether or not Apple would unlock that. And we were definitely the smallest company there. There were 12 tech leaders, and it was sort of the who's who of the big tech companies. And I remember, Tim Cook in this closed meeting started to talk about privacy in a way that was really clear that it came from a deep and personal place, and talk about privacy as a fundamental human right. And that was long before Apple was running commercials on TV about the importance of privacy. And so I think that's something that, they at times have gotten a little bit of a flak investors marketing, but I think I've seen from their senior leadership that that's something that they deeply care about and that's a value that we definitely share with them. And so I've been an Apple fan boy for quite some time and hopefully that's a long enough answer not answering your question. Yeah, so I don't think we've ever been sort of the traditional premium customer. We don't think of \u2013 and from time-to-time, we get great customers that come in through that free funnel. But by and large that's really \u2013 that's not the purpose of that. The purpose of that is really to be able to just innovate as quickly as we can, with such a broad set of customers, and that's paid off incredibly well. I think that, if you fast forward, 10 years from now, Cloudflare's go-to-market motion looks just like any other big enterprise company. And I think we're building that out. You heard a number of deals, where we have now named accounts, specific sales reps, increasingly an enterprise sales team, increasingly working with channel partners and systems integrators. I think, what's different about us is that, we have used data to build out our go-to-market function in the same way that we use data across our entire company. And that's allowed us to both go into new geographies and new markets and customer segments and industries and to move up in terms of servicing larger customers in a way that again, we're not here to tell you that we don't need salespeople. We believe that we do. But I think what we've been able to do is use the data from our existing customers to invest behind the demand curve rather than ahead of the demand curve. And while that gets us to the same point that any enterprise sales company gets to, I think, what it allows us to do is very relentlessly execute and make it much less likely that we make a misstep along the way. Sure. Thanks Shaul. So we're actually pausing the reporting of the total customer count this quarter, although, we're going to bring it back. As just a reminder, total customers included both free and paying customers, and throughout the quarter we saw continued strength in that. The problem was that that really sort of described the different business than we're in today. It looked at active Internet properties and really only covered those products that relied on actually having like a website. And that didn't include a lot of the new products like Cloudflare One and others. And so we don't feel like that statistic was representative. So we're pausing it. We're going to bring it back. In the meantime if you do want to continue to track something like that, there are a lot of external services that track kind of what sign-up rates are we've continued to see strength across that W3Techs report that on a month-to-month basis. And so if that's something that you want to continue to track that that would be the place that I would look to get that. And we're looking forward to bringing our total customer count back in a way that's more accurate going forward. Sure, Drew. So, two areas. Obviously, we continue to invest in our sales and marketing motion and think about how as we continue to go up market, we have the team in place to service that. And again, I think what's unique about us is that we're able to invest behind the demand. But we do believe the salespeople and we do believe that marketing matters. We will continue to invest in that because when you're servicing customers that are as large as we have they want to do that. And it also helps us as we want to expand those customers across our entire product set to have people who can be the advocates who can talk to them and be a part of that. I think the second area where we continue really to invest is in our research and development efforts. Cloudflare runs on innovation and we have designed our entire business in order to be an innovation machine. And so over the course of the year we have a number of new products that we continue to release. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon. And we definitely -- what we like to do is, design the way that we think about R&D as making a number of that in the area, iterating quickly on those across our broad customer base. And then by the time something is ready for us to take it to our largest customers, it's battle-tested and something that we continue to run on. So I don't think that the formula changes. But I do think that as we get to breakeven being able to pour resources back into that if anything should just accelerate the rate at which we are able to drive real innovation across the company. Sure. So let me take both questions and then Thomas may want to add to the first. So first of all, with carriers we work and have had partnerships with carriers for quite some time. Most of the new deployment that we go into we're deploying directly into the carriers' networks. And we have a very symbiotic relationship with them and have been able to continue to invest in that. We're able to see what the traffic flows are across public clouds and we don't see that there's much resonance for some of the carrier partnerships with the public cloud yet, but it's something that we obviously are watching closely and carefully. And I think that the opportunity that we have is to continue to be a great partner to those carriers wherever they are around the world both to deliver our services and be able to drive down our costs as we continue to build. And I apologize in the process of answering that I forgot what your first question was. But can you repeat it just quickly? Yes. So again we're -- that is something that we focused on. What I love about Cloudflare is when we focus on something we're really good at improving it. I think that it's been driven by new products. And since we don't have a usage-based model where sort of revenue can trombone up and down over time but instead, we have a subscription model it really requires us to sell more products and I think that that's been a piece of it. I think going back to what Thomas spoke about earlier as the bundling opportunity that feels like the opportunity for us to be able to continue to improve that number over time. I will say that there might be some noise in the dollar-based net retention number where we definitely have worked hard to get it above 120% and we think that that's great. We're not satisfied with where it is. There may be from quarter-to-quarter a little bit of noise in that metric. But we do think that over time we can continue to improve that metric. Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. So I think it's a pretty mature solution. We launched it in 2017 and it is -- we're seeing very, very, very large companies bet their businesses on workers. So I think that that -- it is a large solution. I think that what we have been hesitant to do is break out what the specific revenue is because it tends to be part of the larger component of how we're selling our solution. But we continue to see strength in workers. We see people building and not random start-ups, but really sophisticated large companies building sophisticated complicated application using Workers. And so it is already taking workloads off of the traditional public clouds and the people and the organization just find it magical. So again I think that that even at the prices that we charge for Workers today it is very margin accretive for us. And so again I think it is a competitive product. We think that being very cost-effective is important when you're selling cloud products. We don't think of ourselves as competing with other niche edge computing platforms. We think of ourselves as competing with the big public cloud platform. And so when we think about pricing we think about pricing it in a way that is competitive with those other public clouds and even at those rates again it's margin accretive for us. Yes. So the first bit is the computing piece of edge computing is the easy piece. The hard piece of storage. And what I think you've seen us do is think through how to have distributed storage in a way that is still easy for developers to wrap their heads around and build, but at the same time gives them the flexibility where they can do things like require a piece of data, never leave a particular geography. And so I think that the regulatory environment for our customers continues to get more and more complex we're seeing a lot of attention for the regulatory concerns which are coming out of the EU. But what we hear from customers is that that's just the tip of the iceberg and places like India and Brazil and obviously China and others are also putting in place requirements that require people to keep their data from users in country in that particular region. And so I think that Workers is perfectly positioned for what is a much more complex regulatory environment. We are today in well over 100 countries worldwide. We're on a path to being in virtually every country worldwide. And what that allows us to do is, help our customers comply with these increasingly complex regulations around the world. We talked earlier about FedRAMP. Again that's very U.S.-focused. We're doing similar efforts, for example, with the German equivalent and others around the world. And again, I think, that sets us up very well to be able to satisfy the regulatory and compliance needs of many large enterprises. And it's what we keep hearing as the real killer feature that distinguishes Workers from any other computing platform. Yes, sure. So, more than 50,000 developers wrote their first Workers script or code this time. And that's not signed up for an account. That's actually wrote code and deployed an application. We can -- that continues to grow over time and the retention of those developers. They don't tend to just write something and then go away, but we see them continuing to deliver more and more application and more and more sophisticated applications, as we watch what developers are building. And so, I think, when we think about the platform I completely agree with you, whoever has the most developers win, we want to make a platform which, yes, satisfies the CIO and CTO and General Counsel for its regulatory compliance. Yes, it is incredibly cost effective. Of course, it is incredibly consistent. We're already the fastest that's out there. But then we really need to continue to invest in making that -- in developing that platform's ecosystem. One of the things that I'm excited about is, well, we've largely talked about big customers here. We're increasingly seeing startups that are building entire applications from scratch on the Workers platform. And that's exciting, both because it's really just a very fervent area of excitement and it's how you build communities and build ecosystem. But it also is a great way for us to be looking out, whether or not there are really great features that maybe other companies and small companies develop that might be natural either things that we can bring into a marketplace or maybe even as potential tuck-in acquisitions that don't have the technical integration risk that would be if they were using completely different platforms. So, I'm excited about it. If you search on Twitter, if you go in our Discord channel, you'll see the developers are excited about it and again it's picking up steam. So, I'll take the second half of that and then Thomas can comment on the first half. So, we -- at our last Investor Day we updated that today it's north of -- I think it's 80% Tom, so correct me if I'm wrong, our customers are using four or more of our products. And that tends to be the magic number for us in terms of really having stickiness and really differentiating ourselves in the marketplace. And typically customers will span across both security but then also performance and reliability. About 50% of our revenue -- 50% of sort of the initial interest that we get comes from our security products, about 25% from performance, about 25% from reliability. But I think that that somewhat mischaracterizes what Cloudflare really is which is a platform that allows you to have all three of those things in one unified solution. So, we continue to see that customers are taking more of our products as we launch products we're really building out that engine makes it so that we can very quickly our new products into our existing customer base and have them adopted. And that -- again, I think that that is -- it is very difficult to compete with us once we get customers to understand the power of using the broad platform that we have. And I got the -- I looked at that quickly. It's 88% of our contracted customers used four or more cloud product and 79% are five or more. Yes, absolutely. I think that if you look at what for example the United States government chose and is going to be offering to all civilian federal agencies. That's a subset of the Cloudflare for Teams product in order to make sure that government workers are not targeted by malware don't fall for phishing scams. And so, we're really proud of that win. But there were many, many, many more wins where Cloudflare for Teams is going up against companies that only do that sort of Zero Trust types of solution. And our win rates are very strong. I think the place where we have really excelled is in both ease of use. And it sort of either use needs of deployment, which again I think comes from the heritage that we've always really thought about, how can, we make things incredibly easy to use. And then, secondly, we really resonate with the developer community. And so for the more technical buyers, they are -- we win those deals up, down, left, right and sideways. And I think where we continue to invest and where we will make progress is making sure that we are top right in Gartner and Forrester and all of the other analyst briefings. But again, starting with some of these great customer wins that we have is the key in order to order to be able to demonstrate that from the industry. And we think we're well on the path to being in the consideration set for anyone who is thinking about Zero Trust solutions. Yes. It is margin accretive -- even at 78% gross margin. We had an absolutely terrific quarter. Really appreciate all of our team, working hard to deliver the results that we have. Looking forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming shareholder and technology conferences and we're going to get back to work to helping build a better Internet. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jayson Noland, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJayson Noland: Thank you for joining us to discuss Cloudflare's financial results for the first quarter 2021.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jayson. We had an outstanding quarter. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $138 million, up 51% year-over-year. Two factors drove our accelerating revenue: First, we had notable success adding new customers. Overall, our total customer count crossed $4 million in Q1. In particular, we added a record 117 large customers, those that spend more than $100,000 per year with us. Our large customer count was up 70% year-over-year. And as expected, revenue for our customers now accounts for more than half of our total revenue. The second factor driving our outstanding performance in the quarter was the adoption of new products by our existing customers. As we shared in February during our Investor Day, 88% of our contracted customers now use four or more Cloudflare products, up significantly from 18 months ago when we went public. Four is a significant number for us because our usage data suggests once someone is using that many products, customers consider us a core platform that is very sticky and difficult for any competitor to match. Other metrics also show our success selling new products to our existing customers. In particular, in Q1, we achieved a dollar-based net retention rate of 123%, up 400 basis points sequentially. Since very little of our revenue is usage based, our success with this metric is driven by our success selling our broad platform to our customers. We saw particular strength in the quarter from Cloudflare One, which unifies Cloudflare for infrastructure and Cloudflare for Team solutions into a platform that we believe represents the future of enterprise networking. It's also worth noting that since we aren't dependent on usage-based billing, we see no indication that as the world comes out of the effects of COVID, our ability to sell more products to customers is slowing down. Cloudflare's engine runs on innovation and in Q1, that engine was firing on all cylinders. Since our last earnings call, we've hosted two innovation weeks, Security Week and Developer Week. We announced or made generally available more than 100 products and capabilities, including magic WAN, our modern MPLS replacement, magic firewall, browser isolation, data loss prevention, superbot site mode, Cloudflare Pages and Workers Unbound. We also entered into strategic partnerships with leading SD-WAN appliance vendors, data center operators, database vendors, observability companies, developer ecosystem support services and even the leading graphics processor company in order to bring advanced AI to Cloudflare Workers. It's been incredible to watch our platform growth. Our strategy with products has always been to get into the market quickly and then relentlessly improve until we are the category leader across each of the features that make up our platform. It's what we've done with products like our DDoS mitigation and web application firewall products, which industry analysts like Gartner and Forrester are increasingly recognizing as the leaders in their categories. But we're seeing the same with new products like Bot Management. We launched our advanced Bot Management feature two years ago. At the time, there were a number of companies that focus just on this one problem. We started small with only a handful of initial early adopters, but quickly, using the incredible data from our VAS platform, we iterated to deliver a product we believe is now the leader in the space. Revenue from this product has grown north of 400% compounding annually. And by the end of this year, we believe we will generate more revenue from just this product and most of the company is focused exclusively on bot management. We can build products faster and better because of the leverage we get from Cloudflare's overall platform. And today, products like Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Pages are following a similar path to Cloudflare advanced bot management. Potential categoric pillars on their own, but with all the benefits for our customers of everything else, our platform is capable of. We had some terrific customer wins throughout the quarter. A Fortune 500 retailer signed a three-year $1.2 million contract to adopt Cloudflare's platform. They preferred our well-integrated approach to performance and security over cobbling together multiple point vendors or using the Frankenstein like solutions other companies have tried to create through M&A. They're implementing our platform and security solutions in the first phase, making extensive use of Cloudflare Workers edge compute platform. There's room for this relationship to grow, and in Phase II we expect them to add bot management, advanced image handling and Cloudflare Pages. A Fortune 500 financial services firm turned to us when they were under a cyber-attack. Their existing hardware and telecom provision solutions couldn't mitigate the attack. They adopted our Magic Transit Solution to protect their entire network and signed a three-year $600,000 contract. They were particularly impressed with our road map and pace of innovation, wanting to go with the long-term winner in this space. Another Fortune 500 financial services firm chose Cloudflare over legacy solutions, they considered inflexible and cumbersome. They signed a three-year $1.9 million contract. They implemented a number of our security services, including bot management. They also introduced Cloudflare Workers into their toolkit, which their development team is already engaged on and particularly excited about. One of the leading SaaS eCommerce platforms chose Cloudflare to protect and secure all their customers. They liked that they could offer seamless protection and blazing fast performance. They signed a $3.6 million 38-month contract. It's worth noting that with this win, a majority of the leading eCommerce platforms are now powered by Cloudflare. A major credit reporting agency signed a four-year $3.6 million contract. The Cloudflare One proposition resonated with them, and they adopted a broad set of our services. They're using Cloudflare to decommission a spider's web legacy hardware boxes and upgrade to a modern cloud-based solution. Cloudflare One was a real star this quarter. We saw wins against more established competitors for our Zero Trust solutions. These included a public VoIP company that purchased 2,800 seats; a large public security company that purchased 1,800 seats; the fast-growing private security organization that adopted Cloudflare One architecture; and even an industrial drone company that is ensuring the highly sensitive data they collect is safe, using Cloudflare's browser isolation technology. As I said, we had an outstanding quarter. When a quarter goes as well as this one, the natural temptation is to wonder what could go wrong. So I thought I'd share some of the things that I worry about: First, I worry about security. There's been a dramatic uptick in the volume and sophistication of cyberattacks targeting our customers and our company directly. While our team security posture and awareness is world-class, we are vigilant in monitoring and addressing the ride in the sophisticated attacks. Second, I worry about our team and our culture. At Cloudflare, I believe we did an incredible job transitioning to our remote work environment. But in the months to come, as we transition to whatever is next, I worry there will be an upheaval across industries as employees reassess not just future of work but their future outlook. Finally, I worry about regulatory risk. It seems that tech companies have swung from being able to do-no-wrong to now being able to do-no-right. That's a growth simplification, but it's accurate to say that the regulatory landscape on a global basis is getting far more complicated and less consistent. We've always been one to turn lemons into lemonade, and our team is good at turning my concerns into products and opportunities. While we are constantly under attack, we're using those threats to productize the sort of Zero Trust network solutions we couldn't find from any other vendor. While employees are likely to use the end of the pandemic as an opportunity to reassess their careers, we are doubling down on actively recruiting and hiring the best talent that previously wouldn't consider changing jobs. And as the regulatory environment becomes more complex, we're using technologies like Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects to not only meet the data residency and locality requirements we have ourselves, but also solve those problems for our customers. Back in 2010, right before Cloudflare's first Board meeting and our launch, I got some advice from one of our early investors. He said running a company is a bit like flying an airplane. You want to make sure it's well maintained at all times. And that when you're flying, you keep the wheel steady and the nose 10 degrees about the horizon. That's stuck with me, and we've designed Cloudflare for consistent and disciplined execution. That shows in quarters like the one we just had. And as you'll hear from Thomas, that gives us confidence as we look forward through the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We had a very strong start to the year. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance, benefiting from record dollar net retention and a record number of large customer additions. Total revenue for the first quarter increased 51% year-over-year to $138.1 million. The growth in revenue was driven by new logo acquisition as well as expansion within our existing customer base. From a geographic perspective, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 61% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 54% year-over-year. APAC represented 16% of revenue and increased 30% year-over-year. We were pleased to see revenue accelerate in the U.S., and we continue to ramp our go-to-market footprint outside of the U.S. In China, specifically, we've seen some headwind to revenue as Baidu ramps down, but we are pleased to see the transition to JD track to our expectations. Turning to our customer metrics. We had a record number of total customer additions in the first quarter, adding roughly 600,000 free and paying customers. We ended the quarter with more than 4.1 million total free and paying customers, representing an increase of 46% year-over-year. We exited the quarter with about 119,200 paying customers, representing an increase of 34% year-over-year. We saw notable acceleration in large customer additions in the first quarter, adding 117 large customers sequentially and 389 year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 945 large customers, representing an increase of 70% year-over-year. Our $1 million large customer cohort continues to be the fastest-growing of the large customer cohorts that we disclosed at our Investor Day in February. We continue to see a balanced mix of new customers and expansion customers in our large customer cohort. We saw significant expansion from our large customers, which helped to drive a record dollar-based retention rate of 123%, representing an increase of 400 basis points sequentially. Our enterprise go-to-market efforts continue to generate significant ROI seen in the success across our customer funnel from free to large customers as well as in our strong dollar-based net retention. In addition, our customer acquisition cost is trending favorably and gives us confidence to continue to invest in our large enterprise go-to-market activities. First quarter gross margin was 77.6%, representing a decrease of 50 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 15% of revenue in the first quarter. We've seen some constraints in the global electronic supply chain, but we believe we are very well positioned to absorb those challenges and continue to expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue for fiscal 2021. Turning to operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased 11% year-over-year to 83%, with another strong hiring quarter with an increase of 41% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to 1,931 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $63.1 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and decreased to 46% from 48% in the same quarter last year. In response to the underlying strength we are seeing in the business, we plan to continue to ramp large enterprise sales capacity and expand our global footprint. Research and development expenses were $28.5 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 21% from 22% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $23.1 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 17% from 24% in the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong operating leverage in the first quarter, with operating margin improving 1,040 basis points year-over-year. Operating loss was $7.5 million compared to $14.4 million in the same period last year. Net loss in the quarter was $9.3 million or net loss per share of $0.03. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was negative 16%. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $2.2 million or 2% of revenue compared to negative $30.6 million or 34% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was positive $23.5 million in the first quarter, or 17% of revenue, which increased $32.3 million sequentially and $37.8 million year-over-year. We mentioned in our prior earnings call that collections were strong in January, and that trend continued through the first quarter, which primarily drove the sequential increase in Q1 operating cash flow. As we have mentioned previously, we expect to see some level of variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital, the growth in our large enterprise business and seasonal factors. Before moving to guidance for the second quarter and full year, I'd like to provide a brief update on the COVID-related impacts and associated provisions we shared last quarter. Throughout 2020, we've disclosed the percentage of revenue represented by customers in COVID-19 macro sensitive industry, such as transportation, hospitality and retail. This cohort represented 8% of revenue in Q1 of 2020 and 7% in the quarter thereafter, including first quarter of 2021. Customer concessions and bad debt also came in well below expectations again this quarter and that remained consistent with historical levels. This is the last quarter we are planning to disclose COVID-sensitive industry metrics since their performance has been consistent and encouraging. In Q1, we saw another strong quarter of new ACV growth, solid retention and large customers making longer-term commitments to Cloudflare. Remaining performance obligations, or ARPU, remained strong in the first quarter, coming in at $439 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially and 88% year-over-year. Current RPO was 76% of total RPO. Given the strong momentum we are seeing, we remain optimistic and confident in the continued growth of our business. As such, we are pleased to once again raise our outlook for both the quarter and full year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $145.5 million to $146.5 million, representing an increase of 46% to 47% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $10 million to $9 million. We expect net loss per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.03, assuming approximately 308 million common shares outstanding, and we expect an effective tax rate of negative 14%. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $612 million to $616 million, representing an increase of 42% to 43% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $28 million to $24 million. We expect a net loss per share over that period in the range of $0.11 to $0.10, assuming approximately 310 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2021 of negative 21%. In closing, it was another very strong quarter, and I again want to thank our Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication and delivering exceptional service to our customers, partners and communities. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Matthew, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the go-to-market this year, obviously, winning some great enterprise contracts. And I'm curious in terms of your approach and your go-to-market, if there's anything you're changing up this year? Is it more of the same formula that you've been executing on in the last year?\nMatthew Prince: Brent, thanks for the question. I think that over the course of the last year, we were very well served from our experience being able to sell without necessarily going and seeing people in person. That obviously is a skill that a lot of other companies had to learn. That's something that goes back to Cloudflare's original days. I think what is changing is that we continue to invest in bringing in some of the best field sales that we need to service these larger and larger customers over time. And so we have been fortunate that over the course of the last year, we've seen an incredible number of candidates that have applied. And I think we disclosed that in 2020, nearly 200,000 applicants applied to work at Cloudflare, about half of those were for sales and marketing roles. And the caliber that those people are coming from is really just extraordinary. And so we've been continuing to invest go to where customers are. But I think our strategy remains the same, which is we invest on a very data-driven basis. We invest behind demand. We invest in a way that ensures that we have a success culture across our sales team. And that has allowed us to continue to move upmarket and sell more to new logos and deliver that. I think the other thing which has really been a highlight of the last year has been how our expanding platform has allowed us to sell more to our existing customers. And so you've seen that expand where, as I said in the prepared remarks, 88% of our customers are now using four or more Cloudflare products. And we are becoming one of their critical platforms. And I think that over time, that's going to do as we still have a lot of products that we are developing and releasing on a regular basis and to allow us to continue to expand with those existing customers. And I'm incredibly proud of our team's ability to get to 123% dollar-based net retention, which is all driven by our ability to sell new products.\nBrent Thill: Great. Just a quick follow-up for Thomas. On the China headwind, you mentioned the transition to JD. Is that largely going to be - is that going to be effectively finished off in the second half of this year? When does that headwind abate?\nThomas Seifert: Yes. We talked about the headway on our last earnings call and said that it was part of our guidance. So how we look at the remainder of the year is digested in the outlook we gave. If it hadn't been further happened, our growth rate in Asia has been - would have been on historical levels. And it will return to that performance over the course of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Congrats on the acceleration of Q1. Matthew, I wanted to drill in to your comment about the multiproduct sales, which is really interesting. I guess, I'm wondering if you could refresh our memory on some of the top four products today. But I think even more interesting, if we look back two, three years from now, what do you think you have today that could be in, say, a top five list for you guys?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So I think foundationally, the way that we see customers is that what they want is a network that they can plug into and not have to worry about anything else. So they want a network which is fast, a network which is reliable and a network which is secure. And so there are a lot of different products that map to some of the legacy hardware boxes that are out there. So load balancing or firewall or VPN, those sorts of things. But foundationally, what customers want is that next-generation corporate network. And so I think we always struggle at some level answering this question because what we think we're doing is selling that next-generation network and providing the functionality for customers that they need and where they're headed to. If you look at our products, it's a little bit like a master mind game where we really don't care where a customer starts. A lot of times, that initial interest starts with something like a security product, wanting to stop a denial-of-service attack, needing to patch a particular vulnerability. But that really begins a conversation, which allows us to sell more to them over time. And so I think that when you look at our vision for Cloudflare One, which incorporates the Cloudflare for Teams products and the Cloudflare infrastructure products, that's the direction we think we're headed. And again, what it foundationally is providing is that network that you can plug into and get performance, security and reliability, all in one unified package. And that's I think that that's going to make the point cloud solutions that just do one of those things well, look more like features than individual products or stand-alone companies on their own. In terms of what I'm excited about, we saw incredible strength this last quarter in the Cloudflare One offerings and Cloudflare Teams winning very large deals. And I think that that is only accelerating over the next period of time. I think that the features that we have in there will be something that we'll see more and more adoption of across our customers. And so that's an area that I would keep a close eye on. And then obviously, Cloudflare Workers, which is sort of the - which one of these things is not like the other, that opens obviously a whole new market for us, and I've been really impressed that in production from some of the largest companies in the world, they are now relying on Cloudflare Workers as one of their key technologies that their teams are using to build and maintain their applications. So this isn't is it vapor ware. This is what you - if you're going and checking your credit report, there's a good chance that you're actually relying on Cloudflare Workers to do that.\nMatt Hedberg: That's fantastic. Great overview. And then I guess maybe as a follow-up to that, you guys had an announcement with NVIDIA this quarter in terms of a partnership. And I know it's probably not a revenue-generating thing here, at least in the short term. But talk to us about what that does for the speed at the edge? I mean, it seems like it just amplifies everything you've done historically, but maybe talk to the importance of that partnership?\nMatthew Prince: So we want to make Cloudflare Workers the most powerful development platform in the world, not the most powerful edge computing platform in the world. We wanted to be the most powerful development platform in the world. And we think of ourselves as competing not with niche edge computing vendors, but with the core computing vendors that are out there. And so as we talk to customers and as we look at our own needs, one of the things which is of rising importance is being able to do artificial intelligence and model mapping and do it in a way which is incredibly performant. And so we were looking for a partner to help us drive AI running at the edge. NVIDIA is a leader through their graphics processor units. We use their technology internally to drive a lot of our AI models for products like bot management and others already. And so this is a way that we can bring that intelligence and that power to all of the developers. And I guess, I think it's one of many different ways that we're going to make the Cloudflare Workers platform that what we think is the preeminent computing platform for developers, whatever they're trying to do.\nOperator: Your next question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDrew Glaeser: This is Drew on for Sterling. You mentioned the success of bot management and mentioned that Cloudflare Workers and Pages are following a similar path. I was wondering if you could expand upon that point and the trajectory that you're seeing with those products?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So we believe that we want to get products into the market quickly and early. And then use the data and use all of the customers across Cloudflare to iterate on those products and improve over time. And so what we've seen with bot management, what we've seen with a number of new products that we've launched is that if we get them there, they could get customer feedback, then that allows us to very, very quickly make those products significantly better. And so I talked a little bit about Workers. Cloudflare Pages is an ability for us to really satisfy some of the needs of developers. There are a number of companies that are focused exclusively on doing what I call jamstack development environment. That's something that we heard from Cloudflare Workers developers, the tens of thousands of developers that sign up for Cloudflare Workers every single quarter that they were interested in. We had the technology and platform to be able to deploy that across our entire infrastructure without adding significant additional costs. And that's just catnet for developers over time. It helps them move to our platform and makes our platform stickier and stickier. And so that, again, I think, is an embodiment of how Cloudflare thinks about product development. It's how can we take the network that we have, how can we take the customers that we have, learn from them, use the data that we generate from our network and then provide products which are not only faster, more secure, more reliable, but also just provide greater ROI as part of the overall bundled Cloudflare experience. And so that's been a real success. I think it's something that is driving more and more developers to our platform and causing them to build entire applications, relying on Cloudflare Workers and the adjacent products.\nOperator: Your next question is from James Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJames Fish: Congrats on another great quarter. Maybe, Thomas, for you, it does seem like duration is increasing again. Is that just a factor of larger customers signing up more, greater prepayments by those customers? Or any sales incentivization? And then Matthew, for you, what do you see at those regulatory risks you were highlighting in your prepared remarks?\nThomas Seifert: Yes. So our sales cycles are actually getting a little bit shorter, but our contract duration is moving out probably from 12 to 13, to 13 to 14 months. And even more importantly, if you weigh our contract duration dollar base, it's probably out 16 months. And this brings also earlier payments with all the good benefits that you saw on the cash flow side, too. So moving up market being rather successful in large cohorts is driving the good results that you see.\nMatthew Prince: And Jim, I don't think there's anything unique to Cloudflare about the regulatory risk that we face. But I do think that the regulatory environment around the world is getting much more complicated. We're seeing as different countries are requiring data locality and data residency requirements. That's forcing companies to find ways to make sure that all their customer data doesn't leave India or Brazil or Germany or the sort of patchwork of regulatory environment that I think is coming down the line. That impacts us to some extent, but I don't think it impacts us anymore than any other company which is out there. What I do think it does because we have an awareness, and my parents will be happy that the three years I spent in law school weren't completely for waste. That that allows us to think about how we can build products to not only help ourselves meet that increasingly complicated environment, but also help our customers. And so an example of that is something that we launched at the end of last year and brought to GA this last quarter, which is Durable Objects. That allows the developer to write data into a data store and then tag that data with a particular geography saying, in particular, don't ever let this data leave Germany, don't ever let this data leave India. And yet still right through a single application, the ability to address that. As we talk to and as we see Cloudflare Workers being adopted across some of the largest companies in the world, what's driving them to that oftentimes is that complicated regulatory environment. And so I think today, if you look at our customer profile, it's about one in six websites, according to third-party data, today is using Cloudflare. That obviously means that we have a responsibility. But I think that that responsibility is something which is allowing us to build products, which can help service a global audience, and that's part of why you see large Fortune 500 companies adopting platforms like Cloudflare Workers.\nJames Fish: Got it, Matthew. I'm sure your parents are proud of you either way, law career or not just quickly, supply chain shortage out there. Looks like CapEx picked up a bit, I guess it seems like you guys are trying to pre-buy some of the underlying equipment. And understand you guys don't have a huge amount of capacity that's required, because you're not in the media game. But how are you guys managing through the supply chain constraints?\nMatthew Prince: I think, we have invested a lot in delivering what we think of as almost a just in time, infrastructure delivery service. And that allows us to take advantage of times when we were able to get fields in the hardware components that we need. And it allows us to be very nimble and flexible. That was important as we as we got through the last 14 months where we saw unprecedented growth. And we were able to deliver and build out our network, even in the face of that growth. Also say that one of the things that we invested in starting back in 2015, which is starting to pay off out is the flexibility across our platform to not be dependent on anyone particular chip vendor. So we can easily migrate not only between Intel and AMD chips, but also to ARM-based chips. And so right now we have ARM-based chips in production running across our network and processing, user requests, in a way that's incredibly efficient. That flexibility allows us to I think have more options, as the world is dealing with some of the shortages of chips and other semiconductors. And I think that that has - that engineering that flexibility in which we've been doing for quite some time is, allows us to be very nimble as we need to build out our network, but it's something we watched carefully. It's something that we're on top of, but I think that we have more nimbleness and flexibility because of the engineering work that we've done. But I think we are less exposed to it then some others in that space.\nUnidentified Analyst: Helpful, thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joel Fishbein of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for taking the question. Hi, Matthew, this is a follow-up to one of the earlier questions. Obviously, you guys have a huge breadth of products I think you - over a 100 product capabilities. Now, the industry some of the industry players are talking about turning products into I guess features. Can you tell me or tell us how Cloudflare is playing into that and how you guys think about that going forward?\nMatthew Prince: Sure Joel, I mean, I think that that's a big part of our standard today 40.02. If you look at the companies that get to the next stage, they are they are taking their broad feature set, and combining it into what are effectively site licenses, for large customers to deliver a broad platform that solves a large set of needs. And so as we compete with companies that just do one thing well. We are good at doing multiple things well, and we're able to use the overall platform to solve not just one need, but many needs, and give our customers an enormous amount of flexibility as we do that. And so, I think that in the past, there used to be companies focused entirely on something like DDoS mitigation. We've turned that into a feature. There used to be companies focused entirely on, web application firewall, we've turned that into a feature. And I think that as you see us go into a lot of the zero trust market. What's powerful is that when we sell again, somebody who is just providing zero trust gateway services or zero trust access services. We can oftentimes win in those markets by not only providing a better product, but then also bundling it together with other features like DDoS, mitigation, WAP, DNS, and other things. And so over time, that platform becomes richer and richer. And we're making sure that we have the sales sophistication, as we move up the organizational chart, selling multi-million dollar deals, to be selling what is essentially the entire platform to the CIO or CTO. And so I think that's going to be a big part of our story going forward. I think that is the strategy that we're embarking on. And I think that it is a tried-and-true strategy over time. And the one thing that's a little bit different about us and some others is, we have been able to develop the broad set of platform without engaging in very significant M&A over that period of time. And that has a benefit that is not only more efficient, but it also means that our platform is very tightly integrated. And that's something that we hear over and over again, as a real differentiator, where you don't have to have the sort of Frankenstein like approach of a bunch of companies that were bought through M&A.\nJoel Fishbein: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you for taking the questions guys. And really, really nice quarter, two questions, one I think it's for Matthew. Obviously one of the most impressive stat this quarter was the pace of new customer edition. Help us understand how much of that is just kind of the sort of the market getting better. And people looking for these types of solutions overall, understanding the risk environment, and how much is cloud, is there anything particular from an operational perspective or an execution perspective, that really kicked into gear for you guys that enabled those new customers as to really turn on in the quarter? And then I have a follow-up for Thomas?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, I think, you know I think that the first thing is that, I think a lot of companies that in the past, we're sort of clinging to, what we refer to as kind of their Emu boxes, Emu the flightless bird, which is a perfectly good bird, but it can't fly. So there's no way it's ever going to get to the cloud. That over the last year, became something which just was untenable as people shifted to remote work. And so a lot of the companies that in the past were somewhat reticent to shift to cloud-based services, now found themselves saying we're open to this. So I don't think like I actually don't think that that COVID was a particular tailwind for us over the course of last year. And as we've talked about, in previous calls, in a lot of ways, it was a real headwind, because we had to adjust to a lot of things. But I do think that it accelerated the digital transformation. And it freed up a lot of companies in financial services in Europe, in small businesses, that sort of cloud reticent companies in the past to say, okay. We got to take this seriously now. And so I think what's happening is as people are coming back as it's not an emergency situation anymore. IT teams are saying, okay now we need to take that call from Cloudflare, because it's time for us to get serious about making sure that we never have to go through what we went through in the spring of 2020 again. And so, I think that's what's changed in the market. And I think that that will be a positive factor for us - for several years to come going forward. I think the thing has changed at Cloudflare is we've just done what we always do, which is we keep getting more sophisticated in our sales motion more sophisticated in our go-to-market motion. I think we've added really great people, to our team across the board, from individual account managers up to the management of our sales and marketing teams. And I think that that is allowing us to better attract these customers. You can also see it just in things like an industry analyst reports where Cloudflare is showing up in almost all of the categories where we compete as one of the category leaders and in the must consider list. And so I think that that has always been our approach, we start in one place, we work our way up, both in terms of customer size, in different geographies and in different industry verticals. And you're seeing that continued to execute going through this forum.\nKeith Weiss: Got it? Remarkably, that's the second time that email reference has come up in conference calls over the past two weeks, pretty remarkable there. And Tom a question for you, what represent the TAM 46.43, you break it down into app services or trust services, network services? Is that a valid way to kind of think about the revenue buckets on a go forward basis in terms of revenue segments on a go forward basis or is that just kind of market opportunity and revenue segments should be thought of separately?\nThomas Seifert: We really think all the time differently. And how describe the time today is you know, it's largely driven by how boxes were sold, and some are still are sold today. So if you want to market us this way it continues to be 50% falls into their security bucket and 50% falls into the reliability and performance bucket. But the bundling of the product it's really describing that - how we assess customer needs and how we assess the market. And clearly Cloudflare One is the biggest opportunity for us from dollar perspective. How we see the market moving forward.\nKeith Weiss: Got it, that's helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alex Henderson of Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Great, thank you. I appreciate the great print, hopefully people will realize that you really aren't a CDN and don't compete with Fastly after the print. I wanted to change the subject a little bit. One of the critical variables that I think makes your company so different from everybody else is the degree to which you are able to reach and penetrate the coding community. And you shared some statistics on that a quarter or two back? And I was hoping you could give us an update. Maybe the number of coders that are currently coding on your system, the growth rate of that coding base, how many developers? Anything along those lines that would help us to understand just how large and how critically important you become to the coding community?\nMatthew Prince: Yes Alex, thanks for the question. We have a ton of respect for Fastly, and Akamai and Limelight. But we're in a very different business than then they are. We're not usage base by and large, which last year actually felt kind of hard because use is going up, but we weren't able to automatically build more revenue. The good news from that though, is that we also don't feel like we've got an overhang going into the back half of this - the rest, the remainder of this year. And so, I think that just shows that it's a very different business. I actually looked up the data, and Fastly is a - we just don't see them in deals. Because again, I think that they are very much going after the media space and doing media delivery and that something that just very different than what we've ever intended to do. So appreciate you recognizing the difference but that's not to say that they don't have a great business. I think they do it just not one that we really compete with. In terms of developers, we've continued to see very strong growth across the developer platform. We've seen that the rates that we had, as new developer add in Q4 continued through Q1. We launched our developer week in Q1, which was - had an enormous amount of success and a real engagement - from the developer community, and you've seen us add products like Cloudflare pages, which is solve some developers needs and really speaks to that that community. And the other thing that's been amazing has been that we have really started to engage with developers where they are. We have a developer relations team, which is in a chat room on discord, on stack-exchange, on all of the different developer communities that are out there, constantly commuting, hitting with developers. And if you look at how fast the workers is getting built, it's great that we've got all of the sort of Fortune 500 companies that are adding crossbow workers to their stack. But it's also amazing that individual developers are able to build applications with an incredible amount of sophistication, just on their own. And our goal still remains that you want to be the first platform that allows the developer to build $1 billion application by themselves. And I feel pretty confident that's going to happen.\nAlex Henderson: I generally think of you guys is focused on domain-to-domain, domain to user, data in flight protection and performance optimization. That kind of leaves a big space of opportunity open, which I don't hear you talk too much about, which is moving backwards into the DevOps arena and participating earlier and earlier in the programming function. Can you talk a little bit about to what extent you're extending beyond data in flight to data in development?\nMatthew Prince: I think that we, I think one of the things that's important about a company is knowing what you do, and also knowing what you don't do. I think that we - there are places where we think that it makes more sense for us to partner with other DevOps companies. So for instance, we announced during developer week an extensive partnership with Terraform platform and HashiCorp to be able to configure Cloudflare in a very programmable and developer centric way. That's something that resonates not only with developers, but resonates with even the large Fortune 500 companies that that we work with. And so I think that we're always looking for ways to be able to play well within the broader ecosystem. And facilitating that ecosystem, we think is super important. So, I think there may be some things that make sense for us to do. But again, I don't think that we are under any illusion that - we would rather be good partners to the overall DevOps space, and then feel like we have to own every part of it. It similar to how, I think we're a much better partner to the identity providers that are out there, then wanting to build our own identity provider. We're much better partners to the endpoint security providers that are out there than ever wanting to get to that space. We do the network super well. And that's something that every developer needs. And so, we want to make sure that we're providing that in a way that works well within the broader ecosystem. Alex, just leave there, we got it.\nAlex Henderson: Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Thanks, Alex. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Shebly Seyrafi of FBN Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes, so thank you very much. Can you quantify your Cloudflare for teams offering? It was, I think, last year less than 10% of revenue, has it crossed the 10% Billy for example, which products their group perhaps more than expected access, for example. Do you expect to come down as the world recovers from COVID? And do you expect browser isolation and DLP to ramp well this year?\nThomas Seifert: Yes, so we're not taking out revenue on a product level and on a product basis for most of last year, our team product was for free. So there's not a lot of revenue contribution in last year's numbers. So this leaves of course, a bigger opportunity for this year, but will not give guidance moving forward on a product base. That's not how we think about the business in terms of bundling and how we are competitive in specific situations, especially against companies and competitors that only have one product as you heard from Matthew so our opportunities really in the bundling of the products here. And we are really proud with the product isolation offering that we just launched. It's an exciting product and it draws a lot of interest from our customers.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay and then one more, you said product management was up more than 400%. That's quite impressive and it's more than any pure play out there in terms of revenue. Can you share with us what that number is for the other companies? What's the highest revenue that's out there from the pure plays?\nThomas Seifert: What I said about team and browser isolation is also true for mitigation. We're not going to talk about our specific revenue numbers. I think what is more important is the transformation that Matthew was talking about, that we turning products, standalone products into features on our network. And DDoS mitigation is one of those future rise offerings, where we see tremendous success based on the strength of our platform, and of the product itself.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from James Breen of William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJames Breen: Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple, one on the sales and marketing side, around 46% of revenue this quarter long-term model being 2729, seems like you've highlight people in that group. How do you think about that, as we move out over the next couple of years? Is the sales team in place now to grossing input top line? When can that start to come down? And then just from a business perspective, you get a lot of revenue globally. Any thoughts there on your customer base and you have multiple customers speaking products in multiple locations? And then just lastly, on cash, $1 billion in cash. You're hovering around cash flow breakeven right now. What are your thoughts on that? You haven't really done any M&A. It doesn't seem like you need to do it to grow, just sort of strategic thoughts on the cash balance.\nThomas Seifert: Yes. Maybe I start there and then talk about sales and marketing, and Matt, you can comment on the other question. So the $1 billion of cash is certainly not burning a hole in our pocket. That was a transaction that we started last year in the pandemic, where our outlook in the business environment was very - was not very certain. It certainly doesn't give us as an incentive to be super aggressive on merger, on M&A activities. We always talked about how we have a natural bias towards internal development because it's just really difficult for us to find attractive targets that are in incredible in our software set. So it was supposed to make our balance sheet strong, make us opportunistic in terms of business opportunities that might show up. BUT it certainly is not putting any increased pressure on us to burn the money on M&A. On the sales and marketing side, we are committed to our long-term model, but we also realize that we are in a very unique position that every dollar we currently spend on our home sales and marketing is delivering superior ROI in terms of top line growth, whether it's new logo acquisition or expansion of existing customers. And we always said as long as our investment gets rewarded with superior returns, we are going to continue to spend in this direction, with plenty of opportunity to expand our footprint. And more importantly, not only the ROI is good, our customer acquisition costs are tracking also really favorable. So we feel good about the strategy that Matthew was talking about before, following the data, following behind the demand curve that we see from a customer perspective. And as long as the ROI is right, we will continue that strategy.\nJames Breen: Great. Just on the globalization of the product, you talked about having customers taking for products. Do you have multiple customers keep going across multiple regions? Could you just talk about that a bit?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So I mean, whenever we're selling to a Fortune 500 customer, they're going to be across many of our different regions. And as our sales team has gotten more sophisticated, it helps us support these more complicated sales. But Cloudflare was a global company from almost an instant that we launched. And we're adding the capacity to service customers around the world. And I think the thing that remains something that is different about us is how international, where about 50% of our revenue does come from outside the United States. We have that built in already. I think we have a brand that resonates around the rest of the world. And as we add sales capacity around the world, that helps. I also think that what people want, if you - if you're a Fortune 500 company, you want to be able to have one company that can service you anywhere you have an office. And the fact that today, we're in more than 200 cities worldwide, within milliseconds of the vast majority of the world's population, that's an enormous advantage, especially as we work with more sophisticated customers. And so if you look at one of the largest mining companies in the world, they literally operate on every continent, except Antarctica. They rely on Cloudflare's network for a broad set of services. And that's something that having the global presence that we do is critical to winning these larger and more sophisticated customers.\nOperator: Your last question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercorp. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. I'm glad I made it under the line there. I have two questions. I'll ask them the same time, hope to make it quicker for you all. Matthew, if I think about your TAM, it's gone from $32 billion in IPO to, I think, $70 billion, $80 billion today. Your penetration rate would imply it's about 0.5% to maybe 1% now. How do you manage between focusing on expanding your TAM, which is kind of what you've done so far, versus perhaps penetrating a TAM further? How do you go between those two buckets? And then, Thomas, was there anything one-off on the dollar-based net retention number with a nice uplift? So how do we think of that as we go forward?\nMatthew Prince: So Amit, I think that from the beginning, we designed Cloudflare's R&D infrastructure to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. And so I think we - I think it's sort of a false economy if you tilt your R&D organization, right? So we have 90% of our R&D organization that's really focused on how do we go deep on any of the products and features that we've launched, and they are always thinking about how do we continue to take feedback from customers, whether they're current customers or customers or prospects in order to build out the functionality across our platform, so that we can service whatever it is they need. The power of that is that if we build reporting for one - more sophisticated reporting for one of our products, that has benefits across all our products, and that's the power of being the unified platform that we have created. 10% of our team is really dedicated to an organization we call ETI, which is the Emerging Technology and Incubations team. And their job is to invent the future. And we don't spend - they have incentives around thinking up what is the product, a feature which two years from now you guys are going to say, wow, that was a huge way that Cloudflare expanded TAM. They take lots of shots on goal. Not all of them are successful, but they are the team that came up with Cloudflare Team. They're the team that came up with Cloudflare Workers. And so they are often when we do expand the TAM dramatically, they're the team that is driving that. And so I think having that ability to walk, go deeper on the existing products that we have and also chew gum, make the - make new products that dramatically leverage the network that we have to go into new industries and into surprising other direction, I think that's how you build what is an iconic technology company over time. And that - and we have no - that's exactly what we've set out to do and how we've designed the company from the beginning.\nThomas Seifert: And DNR, unlike the third quarter of last year, we don't have any onetime items in the first quarter of this year. DNR is quite a lagging indicator. So what you see today is really hard and focused work over the last 12 months starting to pay off and being visible in the DNR metrics. It will continue to tick up, but not in a straight line. We'll see some variability over the quarters, but we still think we have room for improvement and will continue to go up.\nOperator: I will now turn the call over to Matthew Prince for closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: I just wanted to say thank you to all of the Cloudflare team for incredibly hard work. You make my, Michelle and Thomas' job up here easy when we have quarters like this. It takes us delivering great products, it takes us servicing our customers well, and it takes everyone at Cloudflare to build the iconic technology company that we aim to become over time. And so I wanted to appreciate everyone on the team. Thank you for all of your hard work, and we're hard at work already on Q2. So see you back a few months from now at the same time. And until then, look forward to a great and strong quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We had a very strong start to the year. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance, benefiting from record dollar net retention and a record number of large customer additions. Total revenue for the first quarter increased 51% year-over-year to $138.1 million. The growth in revenue was driven by new logo acquisition as well as expansion within our existing customer base. From a geographic perspective, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 61% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 54% year-over-year. APAC represented 16% of revenue and increased 30% year-over-year. We were pleased to see revenue accelerate in the U.S., and we continue to ramp our go-to-market footprint outside of the U.S. In China, specifically, we've seen some headwind to revenue as Baidu ramps down, but we are pleased to see the transition to JD track to our expectations. Turning to our customer metrics. We had a record number of total customer additions in the first quarter, adding roughly 600,000 free and paying customers. We ended the quarter with more than 4.1 million total free and paying customers, representing an increase of 46% year-over-year. We exited the quarter with about 119,200 paying customers, representing an increase of 34% year-over-year. We saw notable acceleration in large customer additions in the first quarter, adding 117 large customers sequentially and 389 year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 945 large customers, representing an increase of 70% year-over-year. Our $1 million large customer cohort continues to be the fastest-growing of the large customer cohorts that we disclosed at our Investor Day in February. We continue to see a balanced mix of new customers and expansion customers in our large customer cohort. We saw significant expansion from our large customers, which helped to drive a record dollar-based retention rate of 123%, representing an increase of 400 basis points sequentially. Our enterprise go-to-market efforts continue to generate significant ROI seen in the success across our customer funnel from free to large customers as well as in our strong dollar-based net retention. In addition, our customer acquisition cost is trending favorably and gives us confidence to continue to invest in our large enterprise go-to-market activities. First quarter gross margin was 77.6%, representing a decrease of 50 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 15% of revenue in the first quarter. We've seen some constraints in the global electronic supply chain, but we believe we are very well positioned to absorb those challenges and continue to expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue for fiscal 2021. Turning to operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased 11% year-over-year to 83%, with another strong hiring quarter with an increase of 41% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to 1,931 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $63.1 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue was flat sequentially and decreased to 46% from 48% in the same quarter last year. In response to the underlying strength we are seeing in the business, we plan to continue to ramp large enterprise sales capacity and expand our global footprint. Research and development expenses were $28.5 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 21% from 22% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $23.1 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 17% from 24% in the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong operating leverage in the first quarter, with operating margin improving 1,040 basis points year-over-year. Operating loss was $7.5 million compared to $14.4 million in the same period last year. Net loss in the quarter was $9.3 million or net loss per share of $0.03. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was negative 16%. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $2.2 million or 2% of revenue compared to negative $30.6 million or 34% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was positive $23.5 million in the first quarter, or 17% of revenue, which increased $32.3 million sequentially and $37.8 million year-over-year. We mentioned in our prior earnings call that collections were strong in January, and that trend continued through the first quarter, which primarily drove the sequential increase in Q1 operating cash flow. As we have mentioned previously, we expect to see some level of variability in cash flow margins due to ongoing fluctuations in working capital, the growth in our large enterprise business and seasonal factors. Before moving to guidance for the second quarter and full year, I'd like to provide a brief update on the COVID-related impacts and associated provisions we shared last quarter. Throughout 2020, we've disclosed the percentage of revenue represented by customers in COVID-19 macro sensitive industry, such as transportation, hospitality and retail. This cohort represented 8% of revenue in Q1 of 2020 and 7% in the quarter thereafter, including first quarter of 2021. Customer concessions and bad debt also came in well below expectations again this quarter and that remained consistent with historical levels. This is the last quarter we are planning to disclose COVID-sensitive industry metrics since their performance has been consistent and encouraging. In Q1, we saw another strong quarter of new ACV growth, solid retention and large customers making longer-term commitments to Cloudflare. Remaining performance obligations, or ARPU, remained strong in the first quarter, coming in at $439 million, representing an increase of 14% sequentially and 88% year-over-year. Current RPO was 76% of total RPO. Given the strong momentum we are seeing, we remain optimistic and confident in the continued growth of our business. As such, we are pleased to once again raise our outlook for both the quarter and full year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $145.5 million to $146.5 million, representing an increase of 46% to 47% year-over-year. We expect operating loss in the range of $10 million to $9 million. We expect net loss per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.03, assuming approximately 308 million common shares outstanding, and we expect an effective tax rate of negative 14%. For the full year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $612 million to $616 million, representing an increase of 42% to 43% year-over-year. We expect operating loss for the full year in the range of $28 million to $24 million. We expect a net loss per share over that period in the range of $0.11 to $0.10, assuming approximately 310 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate for 2021 of negative 21%. In closing, it was another very strong quarter, and I again want to thank our Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication and delivering exceptional service to our customers, partners and communities. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions? Yes. We talked about the headway on our last earnings call and said that it was part of our guidance. So how we look at the remainder of the year is digested in the outlook we gave. If it hadn't been further happened, our growth rate in Asia has been - would have been on historical levels. And it will return to that performance over the course of the year. Yes. So our sales cycles are actually getting a little bit shorter, but our contract duration is moving out probably from 12 to 13, to 13 to 14 months. And even more importantly, if you weigh our contract duration dollar base, it's probably out 16 months. And this brings also earlier payments with all the good benefits that you saw on the cash flow side, too. So moving up market being rather successful in large cohorts is driving the good results that you see. We really think all the time differently. And how describe the time today is you know, it's largely driven by how boxes were sold, and some are still are sold today. So if you want to market us this way it continues to be 50% falls into their security bucket and 50% falls into the reliability and performance bucket. But the bundling of the product it's really describing that - how we assess customer needs and how we assess the market. And clearly Cloudflare One is the biggest opportunity for us from dollar perspective. How we see the market moving forward. Yes, so we're not taking out revenue on a product level and on a product basis for most of last year, our team product was for free. So there's not a lot of revenue contribution in last year's numbers. So this leaves of course, a bigger opportunity for this year, but will not give guidance moving forward on a product base. That's not how we think about the business in terms of bundling and how we are competitive in specific situations, especially against companies and competitors that only have one product as you heard from Matthew so our opportunities really in the bundling of the products here. And we are really proud with the product isolation offering that we just launched. It's an exciting product and it draws a lot of interest from our customers. What I said about team and browser isolation is also true for mitigation. We're not going to talk about our specific revenue numbers. I think what is more important is the transformation that Matthew was talking about, that we turning products, standalone products into features on our network. And DDoS mitigation is one of those future rise offerings, where we see tremendous success based on the strength of our platform, and of the product itself. Yes. Maybe I start there and then talk about sales and marketing, and Matt, you can comment on the other question. So the $1 billion of cash is certainly not burning a hole in our pocket. That was a transaction that we started last year in the pandemic, where our outlook in the business environment was very - was not very certain. It certainly doesn't give us as an incentive to be super aggressive on merger, on M&A activities. We always talked about how we have a natural bias towards internal development because it's just really difficult for us to find attractive targets that are in incredible in our software set. So it was supposed to make our balance sheet strong, make us opportunistic in terms of business opportunities that might show up. BUT it certainly is not putting any increased pressure on us to burn the money on M&A. On the sales and marketing side, we are committed to our long-term model, but we also realize that we are in a very unique position that every dollar we currently spend on our home sales and marketing is delivering superior ROI in terms of top line growth, whether it's new logo acquisition or expansion of existing customers. And we always said as long as our investment gets rewarded with superior returns, we are going to continue to spend in this direction, with plenty of opportunity to expand our footprint. And more importantly, not only the ROI is good, our customer acquisition costs are tracking also really favorable. So we feel good about the strategy that Matthew was talking about before, following the data, following behind the demand curve that we see from a customer perspective. And as long as the ROI is right, we will continue that strategy. And DNR, unlike the third quarter of last year, we don't have any onetime items in the first quarter of this year. DNR is quite a lagging indicator. So what you see today is really hard and focused work over the last 12 months starting to pay off and being visible in the DNR metrics. It will continue to tick up, but not in a straight line. We'll see some variability over the quarters, but we still think we have room for improvement and will continue to go up."

            "content": "Thank you, Jayson. We had an outstanding quarter. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $138 million, up 51% year-over-year. Two factors drove our accelerating revenue: First, we had notable success adding new customers. Overall, our total customer count crossed $4 million in Q1. In particular, we added a record 117 large customers, those that spend more than $100,000 per year with us. Our large customer count was up 70% year-over-year. And as expected, revenue for our customers now accounts for more than half of our total revenue. The second factor driving our outstanding performance in the quarter was the adoption of new products by our existing customers. As we shared in February during our Investor Day, 88% of our contracted customers now use four or more Cloudflare products, up significantly from 18 months ago when we went public. Four is a significant number for us because our usage data suggests once someone is using that many products, customers consider us a core platform that is very sticky and difficult for any competitor to match. Other metrics also show our success selling new products to our existing customers. In particular, in Q1, we achieved a dollar-based net retention rate of 123%, up 400 basis points sequentially. Since very little of our revenue is usage based, our success with this metric is driven by our success selling our broad platform to our customers. We saw particular strength in the quarter from Cloudflare One, which unifies Cloudflare for infrastructure and Cloudflare for Team solutions into a platform that we believe represents the future of enterprise networking. It's also worth noting that since we aren't dependent on usage-based billing, we see no indication that as the world comes out of the effects of COVID, our ability to sell more products to customers is slowing down. Cloudflare's engine runs on innovation and in Q1, that engine was firing on all cylinders. Since our last earnings call, we've hosted two innovation weeks, Security Week and Developer Week. We announced or made generally available more than 100 products and capabilities, including magic WAN, our modern MPLS replacement, magic firewall, browser isolation, data loss prevention, superbot site mode, Cloudflare Pages and Workers Unbound. We also entered into strategic partnerships with leading SD-WAN appliance vendors, data center operators, database vendors, observability companies, developer ecosystem support services and even the leading graphics processor company in order to bring advanced AI to Cloudflare Workers. It's been incredible to watch our platform growth. Our strategy with products has always been to get into the market quickly and then relentlessly improve until we are the category leader across each of the features that make up our platform. It's what we've done with products like our DDoS mitigation and web application firewall products, which industry analysts like Gartner and Forrester are increasingly recognizing as the leaders in their categories. But we're seeing the same with new products like Bot Management. We launched our advanced Bot Management feature two years ago. At the time, there were a number of companies that focus just on this one problem. We started small with only a handful of initial early adopters, but quickly, using the incredible data from our VAS platform, we iterated to deliver a product we believe is now the leader in the space. Revenue from this product has grown north of 400% compounding annually. And by the end of this year, we believe we will generate more revenue from just this product and most of the company is focused exclusively on bot management. We can build products faster and better because of the leverage we get from Cloudflare's overall platform. And today, products like Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Pages are following a similar path to Cloudflare advanced bot management. Potential categoric pillars on their own, but with all the benefits for our customers of everything else, our platform is capable of. We had some terrific customer wins throughout the quarter. A Fortune 500 retailer signed a three-year $1.2 million contract to adopt Cloudflare's platform. They preferred our well-integrated approach to performance and security over cobbling together multiple point vendors or using the Frankenstein like solutions other companies have tried to create through M&A. They're implementing our platform and security solutions in the first phase, making extensive use of Cloudflare Workers edge compute platform. There's room for this relationship to grow, and in Phase II we expect them to add bot management, advanced image handling and Cloudflare Pages. A Fortune 500 financial services firm turned to us when they were under a cyber-attack. Their existing hardware and telecom provision solutions couldn't mitigate the attack. They adopted our Magic Transit Solution to protect their entire network and signed a three-year $600,000 contract. They were particularly impressed with our road map and pace of innovation, wanting to go with the long-term winner in this space. Another Fortune 500 financial services firm chose Cloudflare over legacy solutions, they considered inflexible and cumbersome. They signed a three-year $1.9 million contract. They implemented a number of our security services, including bot management. They also introduced Cloudflare Workers into their toolkit, which their development team is already engaged on and particularly excited about. One of the leading SaaS eCommerce platforms chose Cloudflare to protect and secure all their customers. They liked that they could offer seamless protection and blazing fast performance. They signed a $3.6 million 38-month contract. It's worth noting that with this win, a majority of the leading eCommerce platforms are now powered by Cloudflare. A major credit reporting agency signed a four-year $3.6 million contract. The Cloudflare One proposition resonated with them, and they adopted a broad set of our services. They're using Cloudflare to decommission a spider's web legacy hardware boxes and upgrade to a modern cloud-based solution. Cloudflare One was a real star this quarter. We saw wins against more established competitors for our Zero Trust solutions. These included a public VoIP company that purchased 2,800 seats; a large public security company that purchased 1,800 seats; the fast-growing private security organization that adopted Cloudflare One architecture; and even an industrial drone company that is ensuring the highly sensitive data they collect is safe, using Cloudflare's browser isolation technology. As I said, we had an outstanding quarter. When a quarter goes as well as this one, the natural temptation is to wonder what could go wrong. So I thought I'd share some of the things that I worry about: First, I worry about security. There's been a dramatic uptick in the volume and sophistication of cyberattacks targeting our customers and our company directly. While our team security posture and awareness is world-class, we are vigilant in monitoring and addressing the ride in the sophisticated attacks. Second, I worry about our team and our culture. At Cloudflare, I believe we did an incredible job transitioning to our remote work environment. But in the months to come, as we transition to whatever is next, I worry there will be an upheaval across industries as employees reassess not just future of work but their future outlook. Finally, I worry about regulatory risk. It seems that tech companies have swung from being able to do-no-wrong to now being able to do-no-right. That's a growth simplification, but it's accurate to say that the regulatory landscape on a global basis is getting far more complicated and less consistent. We've always been one to turn lemons into lemonade, and our team is good at turning my concerns into products and opportunities. While we are constantly under attack, we're using those threats to productize the sort of Zero Trust network solutions we couldn't find from any other vendor. While employees are likely to use the end of the pandemic as an opportunity to reassess their careers, we are doubling down on actively recruiting and hiring the best talent that previously wouldn't consider changing jobs. And as the regulatory environment becomes more complex, we're using technologies like Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects to not only meet the data residency and locality requirements we have ourselves, but also solve those problems for our customers. Back in 2010, right before Cloudflare's first Board meeting and our launch, I got some advice from one of our early investors. He said running a company is a bit like flying an airplane. You want to make sure it's well maintained at all times. And that when you're flying, you keep the wheel steady and the nose 10 degrees about the horizon. That's stuck with me, and we've designed Cloudflare for consistent and disciplined execution. That shows in quarters like the one we just had. And as you'll hear from Thomas, that gives us confidence as we look forward through the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. Brent, thanks for the question. I think that over the course of the last year, we were very well served from our experience being able to sell without necessarily going and seeing people in person. That obviously is a skill that a lot of other companies had to learn. That's something that goes back to Cloudflare's original days. I think what is changing is that we continue to invest in bringing in some of the best field sales that we need to service these larger and larger customers over time. And so we have been fortunate that over the course of the last year, we've seen an incredible number of candidates that have applied. And I think we disclosed that in 2020, nearly 200,000 applicants applied to work at Cloudflare, about half of those were for sales and marketing roles. And the caliber that those people are coming from is really just extraordinary. And so we've been continuing to invest go to where customers are. But I think our strategy remains the same, which is we invest on a very data-driven basis. We invest behind demand. We invest in a way that ensures that we have a success culture across our sales team. And that has allowed us to continue to move upmarket and sell more to new logos and deliver that. I think the other thing which has really been a highlight of the last year has been how our expanding platform has allowed us to sell more to our existing customers. And so you've seen that expand where, as I said in the prepared remarks, 88% of our customers are now using four or more Cloudflare products. And we are becoming one of their critical platforms. And I think that over time, that's going to do as we still have a lot of products that we are developing and releasing on a regular basis and to allow us to continue to expand with those existing customers. And I'm incredibly proud of our team's ability to get to 123% dollar-based net retention, which is all driven by our ability to sell new products. Sure. So I think foundationally, the way that we see customers is that what they want is a network that they can plug into and not have to worry about anything else. So they want a network which is fast, a network which is reliable and a network which is secure. And so there are a lot of different products that map to some of the legacy hardware boxes that are out there. So load balancing or firewall or VPN, those sorts of things. But foundationally, what customers want is that next-generation corporate network. And so I think we always struggle at some level answering this question because what we think we're doing is selling that next-generation network and providing the functionality for customers that they need and where they're headed to. If you look at our products, it's a little bit like a master mind game where we really don't care where a customer starts. A lot of times, that initial interest starts with something like a security product, wanting to stop a denial-of-service attack, needing to patch a particular vulnerability. But that really begins a conversation, which allows us to sell more to them over time. And so I think that when you look at our vision for Cloudflare One, which incorporates the Cloudflare for Teams products and the Cloudflare infrastructure products, that's the direction we think we're headed. And again, what it foundationally is providing is that network that you can plug into and get performance, security and reliability, all in one unified package. And that's I think that that's going to make the point cloud solutions that just do one of those things well, look more like features than individual products or stand-alone companies on their own. In terms of what I'm excited about, we saw incredible strength this last quarter in the Cloudflare One offerings and Cloudflare Teams winning very large deals. And I think that that is only accelerating over the next period of time. I think that the features that we have in there will be something that we'll see more and more adoption of across our customers. And so that's an area that I would keep a close eye on. And then obviously, Cloudflare Workers, which is sort of the - which one of these things is not like the other, that opens obviously a whole new market for us, and I've been really impressed that in production from some of the largest companies in the world, they are now relying on Cloudflare Workers as one of their key technologies that their teams are using to build and maintain their applications. So this isn't is it vapor ware. This is what you - if you're going and checking your credit report, there's a good chance that you're actually relying on Cloudflare Workers to do that. So we want to make Cloudflare Workers the most powerful development platform in the world, not the most powerful edge computing platform in the world. We wanted to be the most powerful development platform in the world. And we think of ourselves as competing not with niche edge computing vendors, but with the core computing vendors that are out there. And so as we talk to customers and as we look at our own needs, one of the things which is of rising importance is being able to do artificial intelligence and model mapping and do it in a way which is incredibly performant. And so we were looking for a partner to help us drive AI running at the edge. NVIDIA is a leader through their graphics processor units. We use their technology internally to drive a lot of our AI models for products like bot management and others already. And so this is a way that we can bring that intelligence and that power to all of the developers. And I guess, I think it's one of many different ways that we're going to make the Cloudflare Workers platform that what we think is the preeminent computing platform for developers, whatever they're trying to do. Sure. So we believe that we want to get products into the market quickly and early. And then use the data and use all of the customers across Cloudflare to iterate on those products and improve over time. And so what we've seen with bot management, what we've seen with a number of new products that we've launched is that if we get them there, they could get customer feedback, then that allows us to very, very quickly make those products significantly better. And so I talked a little bit about Workers. Cloudflare Pages is an ability for us to really satisfy some of the needs of developers. There are a number of companies that are focused exclusively on doing what I call jamstack development environment. That's something that we heard from Cloudflare Workers developers, the tens of thousands of developers that sign up for Cloudflare Workers every single quarter that they were interested in. We had the technology and platform to be able to deploy that across our entire infrastructure without adding significant additional costs. And that's just catnet for developers over time. It helps them move to our platform and makes our platform stickier and stickier. And so that, again, I think, is an embodiment of how Cloudflare thinks about product development. It's how can we take the network that we have, how can we take the customers that we have, learn from them, use the data that we generate from our network and then provide products which are not only faster, more secure, more reliable, but also just provide greater ROI as part of the overall bundled Cloudflare experience. And so that's been a real success. I think it's something that is driving more and more developers to our platform and causing them to build entire applications, relying on Cloudflare Workers and the adjacent products. And Jim, I don't think there's anything unique to Cloudflare about the regulatory risk that we face. But I do think that the regulatory environment around the world is getting much more complicated. We're seeing as different countries are requiring data locality and data residency requirements. That's forcing companies to find ways to make sure that all their customer data doesn't leave India or Brazil or Germany or the sort of patchwork of regulatory environment that I think is coming down the line. That impacts us to some extent, but I don't think it impacts us anymore than any other company which is out there. What I do think it does because we have an awareness, and my parents will be happy that the three years I spent in law school weren't completely for waste. That that allows us to think about how we can build products to not only help ourselves meet that increasingly complicated environment, but also help our customers. And so an example of that is something that we launched at the end of last year and brought to GA this last quarter, which is Durable Objects. That allows the developer to write data into a data store and then tag that data with a particular geography saying, in particular, don't ever let this data leave Germany, don't ever let this data leave India. And yet still right through a single application, the ability to address that. As we talk to and as we see Cloudflare Workers being adopted across some of the largest companies in the world, what's driving them to that oftentimes is that complicated regulatory environment. And so I think today, if you look at our customer profile, it's about one in six websites, according to third-party data, today is using Cloudflare. That obviously means that we have a responsibility. But I think that that responsibility is something which is allowing us to build products, which can help service a global audience, and that's part of why you see large Fortune 500 companies adopting platforms like Cloudflare Workers. I think, we have invested a lot in delivering what we think of as almost a just in time, infrastructure delivery service. And that allows us to take advantage of times when we were able to get fields in the hardware components that we need. And it allows us to be very nimble and flexible. That was important as we as we got through the last 14 months where we saw unprecedented growth. And we were able to deliver and build out our network, even in the face of that growth. Also say that one of the things that we invested in starting back in 2015, which is starting to pay off out is the flexibility across our platform to not be dependent on anyone particular chip vendor. So we can easily migrate not only between Intel and AMD chips, but also to ARM-based chips. And so right now we have ARM-based chips in production running across our network and processing, user requests, in a way that's incredibly efficient. That flexibility allows us to I think have more options, as the world is dealing with some of the shortages of chips and other semiconductors. And I think that that has - that engineering that flexibility in which we've been doing for quite some time is, allows us to be very nimble as we need to build out our network, but it's something we watched carefully. It's something that we're on top of, but I think that we have more nimbleness and flexibility because of the engineering work that we've done. But I think we are less exposed to it then some others in that space. Sure Joel, I mean, I think that that's a big part of our standard today 40.02. If you look at the companies that get to the next stage, they are they are taking their broad feature set, and combining it into what are effectively site licenses, for large customers to deliver a broad platform that solves a large set of needs. And so as we compete with companies that just do one thing well. We are good at doing multiple things well, and we're able to use the overall platform to solve not just one need, but many needs, and give our customers an enormous amount of flexibility as we do that. And so, I think that in the past, there used to be companies focused entirely on something like DDoS mitigation. We've turned that into a feature. There used to be companies focused entirely on, web application firewall, we've turned that into a feature. And I think that as you see us go into a lot of the zero trust market. What's powerful is that when we sell again, somebody who is just providing zero trust gateway services or zero trust access services. We can oftentimes win in those markets by not only providing a better product, but then also bundling it together with other features like DDoS, mitigation, WAP, DNS, and other things. And so over time, that platform becomes richer and richer. And we're making sure that we have the sales sophistication, as we move up the organizational chart, selling multi-million dollar deals, to be selling what is essentially the entire platform to the CIO or CTO. And so I think that's going to be a big part of our story going forward. I think that is the strategy that we're embarking on. And I think that it is a tried-and-true strategy over time. And the one thing that's a little bit different about us and some others is, we have been able to develop the broad set of platform without engaging in very significant M&A over that period of time. And that has a benefit that is not only more efficient, but it also means that our platform is very tightly integrated. And that's something that we hear over and over again, as a real differentiator, where you don't have to have the sort of Frankenstein like approach of a bunch of companies that were bought through M&A. Yes, I think, you know I think that the first thing is that, I think a lot of companies that in the past, we're sort of clinging to, what we refer to as kind of their Emu boxes, Emu the flightless bird, which is a perfectly good bird, but it can't fly. So there's no way it's ever going to get to the cloud. That over the last year, became something which just was untenable as people shifted to remote work. And so a lot of the companies that in the past were somewhat reticent to shift to cloud-based services, now found themselves saying we're open to this. So I don't think like I actually don't think that that COVID was a particular tailwind for us over the course of last year. And as we've talked about, in previous calls, in a lot of ways, it was a real headwind, because we had to adjust to a lot of things. But I do think that it accelerated the digital transformation. And it freed up a lot of companies in financial services in Europe, in small businesses, that sort of cloud reticent companies in the past to say, okay. We got to take this seriously now. And so I think what's happening is as people are coming back as it's not an emergency situation anymore. IT teams are saying, okay now we need to take that call from Cloudflare, because it's time for us to get serious about making sure that we never have to go through what we went through in the spring of 2020 again. And so, I think that's what's changed in the market. And I think that that will be a positive factor for us - for several years to come going forward. I think the thing has changed at Cloudflare is we've just done what we always do, which is we keep getting more sophisticated in our sales motion more sophisticated in our go-to-market motion. I think we've added really great people, to our team across the board, from individual account managers up to the management of our sales and marketing teams. And I think that that is allowing us to better attract these customers. You can also see it just in things like an industry analyst reports where Cloudflare is showing up in almost all of the categories where we compete as one of the category leaders and in the must consider list. And so I think that that has always been our approach, we start in one place, we work our way up, both in terms of customer size, in different geographies and in different industry verticals. And you're seeing that continued to execute going through this forum. Yes Alex, thanks for the question. We have a ton of respect for Fastly, and Akamai and Limelight. But we're in a very different business than then they are. We're not usage base by and large, which last year actually felt kind of hard because use is going up, but we weren't able to automatically build more revenue. The good news from that though, is that we also don't feel like we've got an overhang going into the back half of this - the rest, the remainder of this year. And so, I think that just shows that it's a very different business. I actually looked up the data, and Fastly is a - we just don't see them in deals. Because again, I think that they are very much going after the media space and doing media delivery and that something that just very different than what we've ever intended to do. So appreciate you recognizing the difference but that's not to say that they don't have a great business. I think they do it just not one that we really compete with. In terms of developers, we've continued to see very strong growth across the developer platform. We've seen that the rates that we had, as new developer add in Q4 continued through Q1. We launched our developer week in Q1, which was - had an enormous amount of success and a real engagement - from the developer community, and you've seen us add products like Cloudflare pages, which is solve some developers needs and really speaks to that that community. And the other thing that's been amazing has been that we have really started to engage with developers where they are. We have a developer relations team, which is in a chat room on discord, on stack-exchange, on all of the different developer communities that are out there, constantly commuting, hitting with developers. And if you look at how fast the workers is getting built, it's great that we've got all of the sort of Fortune 500 companies that are adding crossbow workers to their stack. But it's also amazing that individual developers are able to build applications with an incredible amount of sophistication, just on their own. And our goal still remains that you want to be the first platform that allows the developer to build $1 billion application by themselves. And I feel pretty confident that's going to happen. I think that we, I think one of the things that's important about a company is knowing what you do, and also knowing what you don't do. I think that we - there are places where we think that it makes more sense for us to partner with other DevOps companies. So for instance, we announced during developer week an extensive partnership with Terraform platform and HashiCorp to be able to configure Cloudflare in a very programmable and developer centric way. That's something that resonates not only with developers, but resonates with even the large Fortune 500 companies that that we work with. And so I think that we're always looking for ways to be able to play well within the broader ecosystem. And facilitating that ecosystem, we think is super important. So, I think there may be some things that make sense for us to do. But again, I don't think that we are under any illusion that - we would rather be good partners to the overall DevOps space, and then feel like we have to own every part of it. It similar to how, I think we're a much better partner to the identity providers that are out there, then wanting to build our own identity provider. We're much better partners to the endpoint security providers that are out there than ever wanting to get to that space. We do the network super well. And that's something that every developer needs. And so, we want to make sure that we're providing that in a way that works well within the broader ecosystem. Alex, just leave there, we got it. Thanks, Alex. Operator next question, please. Yes. So I mean, whenever we're selling to a Fortune 500 customer, they're going to be across many of our different regions. And as our sales team has gotten more sophisticated, it helps us support these more complicated sales. But Cloudflare was a global company from almost an instant that we launched. And we're adding the capacity to service customers around the world. And I think the thing that remains something that is different about us is how international, where about 50% of our revenue does come from outside the United States. We have that built in already. I think we have a brand that resonates around the rest of the world. And as we add sales capacity around the world, that helps. I also think that what people want, if you - if you're a Fortune 500 company, you want to be able to have one company that can service you anywhere you have an office. And the fact that today, we're in more than 200 cities worldwide, within milliseconds of the vast majority of the world's population, that's an enormous advantage, especially as we work with more sophisticated customers. And so if you look at one of the largest mining companies in the world, they literally operate on every continent, except Antarctica. They rely on Cloudflare's network for a broad set of services. And that's something that having the global presence that we do is critical to winning these larger and more sophisticated customers. So Amit, I think that from the beginning, we designed Cloudflare's R&D infrastructure to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. And so I think we - I think it's sort of a false economy if you tilt your R&D organization, right? So we have 90% of our R&D organization that's really focused on how do we go deep on any of the products and features that we've launched, and they are always thinking about how do we continue to take feedback from customers, whether they're current customers or customers or prospects in order to build out the functionality across our platform, so that we can service whatever it is they need. The power of that is that if we build reporting for one - more sophisticated reporting for one of our products, that has benefits across all our products, and that's the power of being the unified platform that we have created. 10% of our team is really dedicated to an organization we call ETI, which is the Emerging Technology and Incubations team. And their job is to invent the future. And we don't spend - they have incentives around thinking up what is the product, a feature which two years from now you guys are going to say, wow, that was a huge way that Cloudflare expanded TAM. They take lots of shots on goal. Not all of them are successful, but they are the team that came up with Cloudflare Team. They're the team that came up with Cloudflare Workers. And so they are often when we do expand the TAM dramatically, they're the team that is driving that. And so I think having that ability to walk, go deeper on the existing products that we have and also chew gum, make the - make new products that dramatically leverage the network that we have to go into new industries and into surprising other direction, I think that's how you build what is an iconic technology company over time. And that - and we have no - that's exactly what we've set out to do and how we've designed the company from the beginning. I just wanted to say thank you to all of the Cloudflare team for incredibly hard work. You make my, Michelle and Thomas' job up here easy when we have quarters like this. It takes us delivering great products, it takes us servicing our customers well, and it takes everyone at Cloudflare to build the iconic technology company that we aim to become over time. And so I wanted to appreciate everyone on the team. Thank you for all of your hard work, and we're hard at work already on Q2. So see you back a few months from now at the same time. And until then, look forward to a great and strong quarter. Thank you."

It's great to have you on this side of the table. We had another strong quarter in spite of continued challenging macroeconomic conditions. We generated $274.7 million of revenue, up 42% year-over-year. We achieved a record operating profit of $16.8 million, representing an operating margin of over 6%.  While we continue to invest to capture the huge market ahead of us, we believe that during economic slowdowns, like the one we're in the midst of, it's important to show discipline and optimize for efficiency. We have our hands on the levers of our business and are adjusting them based on the macroeconomic conditions.  Our free cash flow in the quarter was $34 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 12% and allowing us to generate $29 million of free cash flow in the second half of 2022. While there will be some variability in our free cash flow quarterly, we expect to be free cash flow positive in 2023 and in the years after that. We achieved a gross margin over 77% above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%.  Our dollar-based net retention ticked down to 122%, while our gross renewal rates remain as high as ever, like others in the industry, we're seeing customers take longer to sign new and expansion deals with us. Procurement departments are definitely in the mode of measure two or three times before cutting one. We still see a clear path to dollar-based net retention over 130% as we ramp seat-based products, like Zero Trust and storage-based products like R2, and we won't be satisfied until we get there.  We added 134 large customers, those who pay us over $100,000 per year, and now have 2,042 large customers, including 33% of the Fortune 500. Revenue from large customers grew 56% year-over-year, and they now contribute 63% of our total revenue. We were fortunate that given our visibility into the overall Internet traffic and e-commerce trends, we started to see a slowdown in the economy all the way back in December of 2021.  Based on that, around this time last year, we began slowing our pace of hiring to ensure we didn't get over our skis. That paid off and kept us from having to take more drastic actions like many of our peers. It's also given us the ability to sensibly invest in our team as amazing talent comes on the market. To give you some sense, in 2022, we have over 400,000 people apply for approximately 1,300 positions at Cloudflare. That demand to work at Cloudflare has allowed us to continue to hire incredible talent while remaining disciplined in overall compensation.  We are committed to incremental equity compensation dilution well below many of our peers targeting less than 3% net burn rate annually. Tough economic times like these make you assess your strengths and weaknesses. Cloudflare has long had a product and engineering team that delivered an innovation engine that is the envy of the industry. Jen Taylor, who leads that team, briefed me recently on everything we have lined up for the year ahead, and the engine is definitely not slowing down.  Our next innovation week is in March with security week, where we'll be launching a number of new products and feature enhancements, especially around our Zero Trust products. While our innovation engine is the best in the industry and has unlocked $125 billion total addressable market we have ahead of us, if we're honest with ourselves, our go-to-market organization hasn't yet been fully optimized.  As our product become more complicated and we are selling to larger and larger customers, it's increasingly clear that we need to step up our game in marketing and sales. I introduced Marc Boroditsky who joined last quarter to lead our sales organization. Last week, he briefed me and Michelle on his first 100 days. My initial reaction, if I'm honest, was embarrassment over some of the basic things we should have been doing better. But my second reaction was excitement as there are so many opportunities for us to improve.  In addition to Marc, Brent Remai joined us last quarter to lead our marketing team. Brent was previously CMO at FireEye and CMO of Core Services at AWS. His career perfectly prepared him for Cloudflare\u2019s delivery of cloud security services. We've seen early results of Brent's team generating pipeline in Q4 and January Q1, coming in ahead of our targets.  We\u2019ve been leaders on the product and engineering side. Now we're focusing on becoming a leader in the go-to-market side as well. I hear the excitement from our existing sales and marketing teams at the rigor and discipline Marc and Brent are bringing to those teams. And what I'm watching carefully is another important pipeline, the pipeline of new sales talent. We're seeing incredible people from the leading sales team in the world apply to work at Cloudflare. We aim for nothing less than to build one of the leading sales organizations in the world. That's all exciting. And while I believe there's a substantial opportunity for us to improve our go-to-market engine, I'm also cognizant that these efforts can take time. That's why we're not relying on any improvement in sales or marketing efficiency or any rebound in the economy as we look at the year ahead and formulate our guidance.  So focusing on the present, let me highlight some customer wins from the quarter. A Fortune 500 energy company signed a three-year $1.6 million deal that was a takeout of a first-generation Zero Trust networking competitor. We are placing both their Secure Web Gateway and Zero Trust network access products. Because the competitor's network is actually broken into multiple distinct clouds as compared with our unified network, their reliability and performance were underperforming the customers' expectations. We were able to replace the competitor's feature set and more. The customer ultimately purchased gateway, access, remote browser isolation and DNS filtering. The customer was attracted to our better pricing, performance and ease of use as well as the single pane of glass manageability of our platform. We worked with a large channel partner to win and service this customer and expect we'll be doing more with them going forward.  A Fortune 500 financial services company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $1.1 million deal, a [indiscernible] Cloudflare customer since 2014 using our core application services. Like we're hearing from many of our customers, they wanted to consolidate vendors, reduce costs and have more flexibility and control over their traffic flows as well as implementing a Zero Trust architecture. They wanted to move away from legacy on-premise hardware to modern cloud-based services. The customer loves that we have a single pane of glass solution and that our technology is built from the ground up on a single platform rather than a Frankenstein solution bolted together through M&A. They purchased access, gateway, remote browser isolation, Magic WAN and Magic Firewall. They're a terrific customer.  A Fortune 500 telecom signed a $400,000 one-year deal to bring a portion of Cloudflare\u2019s Zero Trust services to their consumer base. They're bundling Cloudflare's DNS content filtering into their consumer security bundle. After evaluating competition, they found Cloudflare solutions to be the most secure and reliable in the market. This deal is not only valuable for the obvious reasons, but also because it will feed data back to our Zero Trust security products to further extend their lead over the competition.  A leading generative AI company signed a one-year $1 million deal. The company had been a user of our free tier since 2017. And this deal originally started out as a relatively small gateway DNS opportunity to replace Cisco Umbrella. However, when their browser-based application debuted in late November, demand for the company's AI-generated content absolutely exploded with unprecedented rates of adoption.  Their Azure Front Door had quickly proved insufficient at handling the massive load on their services from legitimate users as well as keeping fraudulent users from exhausting their resources. They started off with CVM, DDoS, bot management, gateway DNS and more. We are actively exploring various paths for expansion to support their incredible growth as well as emerging use cases of their AI models and applications with Cloudflare Worker, API Shield, imagery sizing and more. We saw success with other AI companies in the quarter as well. Given the resource constraints they all face as well as how attractive they are as a target to fraudulent users, Cloudflare security solutions are an obvious choice for all of them. But many of them came to us for other reasons as well. AI companies, in particular, need to find wherever it's most cost effective to run their models across multiple different cloud providers. They are, by their very nature, multi-cloud, but the data egress policies make it prohibitive to move large training sets between the clouds. Enter Cloudflare Worker.  What we're finding with these AI companies is that R2 and other workers' products naturally become the glue at the center of a multi-cloud ecosystem. R2 has become the natural neutral place for these AI companies to store their training data in order to make sure it can be inexpensively and efficiently accessed from anywhere. It's obvious in retrospect. But it's a use case we didn't anticipate. Today, our largest R2 customer is another AI company using us for exactly the purpose of being a neutral place to store their training data. And, of course, being a neutral network super cloud that stitches together the traditional public cloud isn't a problem exclusive to AI. A European financial services company signed a five-year $1.8 million deal, replacing a dozen different security and network vendors with Cloudflare. This company settles hundreds of millions of securities transactions annually for the largest banks and governments in the world. As a result, security and regulatory compliance are paramount for them. They wanted to consolidate and simplify their numerous point solutions into a single pane of glass solution.  After receiving regulatory approval, the customer signed on for multiple solutions across our core application services portfolio as well as both Zero Trust and network services in Cloudflare One, including access, DNS filtering and Magic Transit. In addition to consolidating their spend across multiple point solution vendors on to Cloudflare's broad platform, our data localization suite, in particular, won them over. Competing vendors simply do not have an equivalent solution. As companies increasingly face localization and data residency requirements becoming law in various geographies, our differentiated data localization suite is becoming more and more critical to customers.  A public utility company in Africa signed a $2.8 million 75-month deal to help support a really cool industrial IoT rollout. They're using Cloudflare's intelligent network to monitor 3,300 sensors, tracking shipments of materials. This is another use case of Cloudflare's network we wouldn't have imagined on our own, but one we're uniquely positioned to deliver for the customer and now opens even more markets and opportunities.  The state of North Carolina signed a three-year, $3 million deal. The state had originally come to us under our Athenian Project for free help with election security. They learned the power of Cloudflare using us to protect their elections infrastructure and signed the deal to expand Cloudflare\u2019s protection across 50 state agencies. Finally, I'm happy to report that after our longer than expected wait at the proverbial DMV, we officially received Cloudflare\u2019s FedRAMP certification. The certification covers nearly our full suite of products with a notable exception of Area 1 e-mail security product, which we acquired after we started the FedRAMP process, but we expect to add it to our certification at the FedRAMP renewal. Our first federal contract after our certification was a great start.  We were awarded the $7.2 million, five-year deal to operate the .gov registry. We were awarded the contract because of our modern infrastructure, technical prowess, relentless innovation and proven ability to defend against the largest cyber attacks. Every e-mail sent to the White House, every agency's webpage and most of the other ways the U.S. government connects to the Internet now depend on Cloudflare and our network. We're proud to have won this business, but the public sector space is only 3% of our revenue today, so we believe it's only the beginning of what we'll be doing in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. I want to take a moment to welcome Phil Winslow, our new VP of Strategic Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations to the team. As an influential equity research analyst who has been following Cloudflare even before our IPO, Phil brings a wealth of knowledge, expertise and relationships to his role at Cloudflare, and we are excited to have him on board. Turning to the fourth quarter. Economic uncertainty resulted in businesses being more cautious with their spending, leading to longer decision making processes and ultimately longer sales cycles during the quarter, pressuring revenue growth across the technology industry, including Cloudflare. However, we remain focused on controlling what is in our control, which is to maintain our commitment to the efficient unit economics of the business and to prudently allocate capital with a focus on maximizing shareholder value. As a result, we delivered a record quarter in terms of operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. I'm particularly proud of our free cash flow performance during the fourth quarter, and we are committed to continuing to scale free cash flow generation going forward.  Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 42% year-over-year to $274.7 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 44% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 42% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 40% year-over-year.  Turning to our customer metrics in the fourth quarter. We had 162,086 paying customers, representing an addition of roughly 22,000 paying customers in 2022 and an increase of 16% year-over-year. We were pleased to see retention improve in the pay-as-you-go customer base in the fourth quarter returning to the levels we achieved in the late 2020 through early 2022. Turning to large customers. We ended the quarter with 2,042 large customers, representing an increase of 44% year-over-year and an addition of 134 large customers in the quarter. During the quarter, we also added a record number of net new customers paying us more than $500,000 a year.  As Matthew mentioned earlier, we are also pleased to see large customer revenue contribution increase again sequentially to 63% of revenue, up from 57% in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2022, large customers represented 61% of total revenue compared to 54% of total revenue in 2021 and 46% in 2020. For the full year, we are also breaking out large customers into cohorts of those who spend greater than $500,000 and $1 million. We ended the year with 222 customers that spent over $500,000 with us, an 83% increase year-over-year. We ended the year with 85 customers that spent over $1 million with us, a 52% increase year-over-year. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 122% during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 200 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 300 basis points year-over-year. We've not experienced elevated churn. Instead, similar to last quarter, the decline was primarily driven by less net expansion in customers spending less than $100,000 worth Cloudflare as well as pay-as-you-go customers. Conversely, our large customer net expansion was flat quarter-to-quarter and remains consistent with our average quarterly DNR for this customer segment since the end of 2019. We continue to expect DNR to trend upward over time to our long-term target of 130% plus. Also, we anticipate some variability from time to time particularly as customers are more cautious in their near-term spending, which, as I mentioned before, has impacted sales cycles. Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 77.4% and 78.2% for fiscal 2022, both of which remain above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. Network CapEx represented 10% of revenue in the fourth quarter. For full year 2022, network CapEx represented 11% of revenue as compared with our guidance at the beginning of the year at 12% to 14%, which demonstrates the flexibility, elasticity and scalability we have achieved in our network. For fiscal 2023, we expect network CapEx to be 11% to 13% of revenue.  Turning to operating expenses. Also their economic challenges for every business currently, we again took proactive measures during the fourth quarter to improve operational efficiency and control discretionary spending. As a result of these actions, fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year to 71%.  Our total number of employees increased 32% year-over-year bringing our total headcount to approximately 3,220 at the end of the quarter. We'll continue to pace hiring for the year based on current market conditions to deliver consistent results with a keen focus on allocating our talent to key strategic areas of the business to help us achieve our objective of $5 billion in annualized revenue in five years and to do so profitably, predictably and productively.  Sales and marketing expenses were $113 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased to 41% from 44% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $49.4 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased to 18% from 19% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1% sequentially and decreased to 12% from 14% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $16.8 million compared to an operating income of $2.3 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 6.1%, an increase of 490 basis points year-over-year. These results underscore our responsiveness to market conditions and our ability to scale up or scale down our spending as needed to meet demand, highlighting the efficiency and elasticity of our business model which remain key elements of Cloudflare's success.  Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $21.6 million or a dilutive net income per share of $0.06. Tax expense for the quarter was $2.3 million. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $33.7 million in the fourth quarter or 12% of revenue compared to $8.6 million or 4% of revenue in the same period last year.  Operating cash flow was $78.1 million in the fourth quarter or 28% of revenue compared to $40.6 million or 21% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $907 million, representing an increase of 9% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. Current RPO was 74% of total RPO.  Before moving to guidance for the first quarter and full year, I would like to begin with our expectations and the provisions we have factored into guidance. We performed rigorous scenario analysis across multiple vectors from pipeline and ACV growth to productivity in order to understand both our company-specific opportunities as well as the risks from the current economic uncertainty.  In our guidance, we have not factored in any improvement in the macroeconomic environment or from our go-to-market initiatives. Specifically, despite a notable improvement in our pipeline exiting 2022 as compared to with the first half of the year, we have assumed the increase in sales cycle, which we observed in the second half of last year, continues in 2023 and have, therefore, incorporated close rates below recent historical lows. Furthermore, as Matthew discussed earlier, we believe sales and marketing can be broken down into a series of processes that can be organized, measured and continuously optimized. Marc and Brent are establishing a consistent structure, model and process that simplifies how we operate and how we interact with prospects, customers and partners.  Because of the new leadership team we have already assembled has successfully executed these go-to-market playbooks before at other companies, we are confident in the ramp of implementing these models and tactics which we expect will ultimately improve revenue growth and productivity. However, we have not incorporated any improvement in sales productivity in our guidance for 2023, embedding in fact productivity levels below our recent historical lows.  Now turning to guidance for the first quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $290 million to $291 million, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $11.5 million to $12.5 million, and we expect diluted net income per share of $0.03 to $0.04, assuming approximately 342 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 36%. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.330 billion to $1.342 billion representing an increase of 37% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $54 million to $58 million, and we expect dilutive net income per share over this period in the range of $0.15 to $0.16, assuming approximately 344 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 36%. Beginning in 2023, Cloudflare is subject to be the [indiscernible] minimum tax, which is the primary driver for the increased tax rate year-over-year. After having achieved positive free cash flow in the second half of last year, we anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2023.  While we expect free cash flow to trend upward on an ongoing basis, for modeling purposes we anticipate near-term variability in our cash flow generation with the first half of 2023 expected to be relatively breakeven. We remain confident in the elasticity and durability of our business model, and we'll continue to pursue the enormous opportunity ahead of us while raising the bar on our operational excellence. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers and partners. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Matt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats, Phil, on your new role. Looking forward to working with you on that side of the table. I guess one of the questions I'm getting is around the conservatism in your '23 revenue outlook. Obviously, Tom, you talked about some of the levers of conservatism. But I guess with 37% growth for both Q1 and the full year, obviously, your comps ease as the year progresses. But is there something that perhaps kicks in during Q2 or the second half of the year, maybe like the price increase you announced last year, or maybe a large customer renewal that would drive linearity this year?\nThomas Seifert1: I think we stick to our rule of trying to be prudent and thoughtful how we think about the future, especially in a rather uncertain environment. I think that the important takeaway in the guidance that we put forward is that we did not assume any help from the macroeconomic environment. We did not plan that things would get better. And we have a lot of initiatives that will accelerate sales productivity and accelerate growth, things that we can control. But we've been rather conservative there too in terms of what we anticipated in the guidance we gave. So I think it was our goal in a world where there are a lot of variables that shift around to find some ground of stability from which where we can build on moving forward. But I think prudent is what we said during COVID and thoughtful is what we said during COVID, and I think we stick to that philosophy, keeping our hands on the steering wheel as Matthew would call it and work on what we can control.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. And then maybe just a quick one, Matthew. Within your security portfolio, you noted some nice wins in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering, can you talk about maybe just some of the win rates specifically on your enterprise-grade customers within Zero Trust deals, I guess, specifically against some best-of-breed customers that you noted on the call?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that we are really happy with our win rates. What I think our challenge is in the Zero Trust space is not winning customers that know about us, but making sure that customers that are in the market for Zero Trust services are aware that that's something we do. The frustration that I still have is when I\u2019ll meet with a customer and oftentimes they'll literally say, you should build something that is in the Zero Trust space, competing with Zscaler or Palo Alto Networks. And so when we're in those deals, we find ourselves winning very often. I think we are especially successful with very technical rigorous companies that measure performance and care about making sure that they have the best possible end user and especially developer experience. But our challenge now, and what Brent and Marc are really focused on, is how in that space do we increase our awareness? And I think you're going to see a lot of us doing that. But when we're in the deal, we tend to have very, very strong win rates that rival what we see from our other products.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next up, we'll hear from Sterling Auty, SVB.\nSterling Auty: Thanks, guys. So Matthew, I think it would be helpful for investors to understand. You had talked about the AI opportunity and the use cases, but help investors understand how the revenue opportunity with those types of customers actually ramped since you have that subscription model versus a consumption model.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So the way that we've been -- the way that it has sort of been the natural way that we thought companies like AI companies would consume Cloudflare would be looking at our security products. And those are products that, as you said, are subscription-based and there's some opportunity there, but there really aren't yet that many AI companies. So that opportunity is fine. But I don't think it's anything that we would get really excited about. I think what we're seeing though is in that cluster of AI companies, they have a real use case for the cloud which is somewhat different than what we see from some other companies. It is, I would say, more forward leaning and that is that they are constantly looking for wherever the best model or wherever the cheapest GPUs are to process their data. And so they are looking around across multiple different cloud providers, whether that's Google or Microsoft or AWS and they're always saying, what can we take advantage of and get as much out of that as possible. And what the challenge for them is, is the AI training sets or these big lumps of data that they then have to sort of bring to wherever the model or bring to wherever that GPU is. And in that case, a lot of the workers products and, in particular, our R2 product, are a very natural way that they can put the data in one neutral location and then be able to access it all around in other locations as well. And what we're seeing is that that neutral position of R2 is actually not just appealing for people in the AI space, but for anyone that has shared data that they want to use not in just one cloud but across multiple different clouds. And so I think by having a way to embed data into the network and store data into the network, that is an opportunity for us to service anybody who is trying to be multi-cloud, which is frankly what every big enterprise today is doing. And in that case, R2 is very much a consumption-based product. And so as AI data sets get larger and larger, we expect that we will be able to grow R2 revenue along with that. And actually, our largest R2 customers, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is an AI company and they're growing at just extraordinary rates as they put more data into their models.\nSterling Auty: And then just a quick follow up is, how much of that ramp is factored into the full year guide?\nMatthew Prince: I think that we are not looking for anything exotic here. I think, again, prudence is very much the sort of word of the quarter for us. And I think that we're not sort of counting on something that is the new hot thing doubling down on Cloudflare. And so while we're very proud of what we have done with companies in the AI space, and we're excited about the ramp in products like R2 and the overall workers ecosystem, we still think of that more as a long-term opportunity than a short-term quarterly or even 2023 opportunity. And so I think that we're not relying on sort of an AI miracle in order to make the numbers that we put up.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll take a question from James Breen, William Blair.\nJames Breen: Thanks for taking the questions. Just one is a little bit of a runoff from that one. Just around some of the new products that you launched, the one full in the back half of last year, R2 being one. Could you just give us some commentary around how that's picking up and launching those into maybe more challenging sales environment as it helped keep the DDR a little more stable than otherwise could have been? And then just financially, Thomas, if you can just talk a little bit about the decline in operating income sequentially into the first quarter, the seasonality there and what's happening? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Jim. So I'll start and then Thomas can take the second part. I think we're really happy with the ramps of these new products. Cloudflare, we've always thought of ourselves as stacking S curves one behind another. And so I always think of sort of our application services products as sort of our first act. We think of our Zero Trust products as our second act. And we think of our workers products as our third act. And so I think that they're maturing at rates that continue to make us very excited and happy and we're seeing more and more new use cases that are coming from that. I think some of the trade-offs around DNR have been interesting here. One of the things that we really talked about last quarter optimizing for was just on how we did cash collections and converting customers to paying upfront. And I think that one of the things that we made a trade-off on was at times saying we would optimize for getting more customers to be paying us upfront. And that might not allow us to expand those customers as much in this quarter. And I think that's the right thing for us to do. We want to optimize in these times, making sure that we can collect cash as quickly as possible, can be paid upfront as much as possible. That continues to be an ongoing effort for us. But I think that that was more of a drag on DNR. I think you'll start to see as those new products come online that those will be positive. But remember that DNR only starts to kick in for a customer that's been with us for an entire year. So for those products that are new, even if they are wildly successful, the expansion won't actually show up in our numbers until 12 months after the products were actually in the market.\nThomas Seifert: All of last year was a year where we did very active management of our expenses. And we reacted really early to the slowdown in the macro environment by slowing down our hiring, especially the velocity of hiring. And we'll stay committed to this course during the course of this year and align our spending to the development of the business. So there were a lot of companies out there during the season's earnings calls that talked about efficiencies. I always like to point out that efficiencies in the DNA of the company of Cloudflare, that is something that Matthew and Michelle already wrote in the founder letter for their prospects for the S1. So this is what you want to expect from us, not only for the first quarter, but for the remainder of this year as long as the environment is what it is.\nJames Breen: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go to Shaul Eyal with Cowen.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats, Phil, on the new role. Looking forward to working with you. Actually two product-related questions for Matthew. So actually starting with workers, so earlier today, Shopify came out with a press release discussing speeding up their storefront in 2023. [Indiscernible] like it is based on Cloudflare workers. I think back in the summer actually, they also had a blog where they confirmed the shutdown of their internal project Oxygen opting now to Cloudflare. So can you talk to us, Matthew, about Shopify relations, maybe just a flavor on workers and an additional win rate?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So Shopify has been a terrific Cloudflare customer for a number of our different products, including workers. And I think, look, we've talked about in previous calls is that one of the most effective ways for us to sort of turbocharge the adoption of workers is to work with other great partners that have an existing developer ecosystem. And so we were proud that Shopify has really standardized around Cloudflare workers. We've worked with them to make sure that we are doing the right things for the overall community that we open source, for example, the run time of workers. And I think that as you see companies like that adopt workers for their developer platform that that's a real opportunity for us to, again, turbocharge what workers is and make sure that more and more developers are on top of it. And what's incredible is just watching how as again we get more reps with really talented and smart engineering teams like the team at Shopify, that's just making the workers platform better for everyone involved. And again, we're really proud to have them as a customer.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. And maybe back to the security side of things. Matthew, in your prepared remarks, you talked about that big security win displacement. But I'm just curious whether it also involved the e-mail security kind of the Area 1 related product?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I want to be careful that I might misspeak, but I don't believe that Area 1 was included in that particular deal. So that's still an expansion opportunity with that customer. We do see that e-mail security is a terrific entry into getting people to move to our Zero Trust platform. The reason why is that Zero Trust one is the first challenges is enumerating how many people are within an organization, how many seats effectively does that organization make up. And if we can get somebody to use our e-mail security product, that inherently defines that in a very natural way. And so migrating somebody from sort of our application services portfolio to our e-mail security portfolio is one click. It's a simple DNS change. And they don't have to -- they can continue to use any of their existing e-mail vendors, and we effectively just proxy that traffic and are able to provide additional layers and enhancement of security as well. Once we've done that, it then makes it a very natural step to go from the e-mail security product to the rest of our Zero Trust suite. And so that is a standard play that we run. It's very successful. But in the case of this particular oil and gas company, it wasn't the reason that they adopted us for Zero Trust. But hopefully, we can go the other direction as well.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you.\nOperator: Next up is Joel Fishbein, Truist Securities.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats to Phil as well. Matthew, for you, I want to take a step back, notwithstanding the current economic situation, I would love to just talk about the barriers to entry for Cloudflare and your top priorities for the next three years in terms of growing the business?\nMatthew Prince: And Joel, by barriers to entry, do you mean for competitors competing against us or what exactly do you mean by that?\nJoel Fishbein: Yes, exactly, Matthew. I think there's a little bit of -- in the investment community, there's a little bit of thought process that it's easy to do what you -- what Cloudflare does. And as you and I both know, that's not true. But I think it's important for you to explain that from the perspective of how difficult it is to provide the services that you do?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So I think the thing that is at the core of Cloudflare is our network, the reason that our ticker is NET and not CLOFLARE [ph] is because of the fact that we are fundamentally a network. And that network has taken us over 12 years to build. And it is not something that you can just throw money at and buy your way into, it's not something that even some of the large hyper-scale public clouds have. And so we hear regularly from companies like Microsoft that they're like, wow, you guys have something very special in the network you've built, and it is very different than anything else that's out there. But somewhat counterintuitive a bit about our network is that as we expand into further corners of universe, whether that's opening an additional data center in St. Louis or going into Djibouti, any of those things actually help us lower our costs because it drives down the cost of delivering all of our services. And the other important bit is that unlike some of the competitors that are out there, whether those are competitors in the application services space that have grown through a series of M&A acquisitions or even in the Zero Trust space, someone like Zscaler actually runs multiple independent networks to provide their various services. And that means that customers that are using those different services not only is it more inefficient for them to service those customers, but those customers experience very performance setbacks when they're delivering their services. And that's something that a lot of the customers that are switching from Zscaler to us note time and time again. What's different about us is we have relentlessly said that we run one single network. And every single server across our entire network is capable of running and performing any of the functions that we may need it for. And so that means that as we grow our services, it allows us to deliver them incredibly quickly, incredibly efficiently and anywhere in the world, and that is paying off today by allowing us to continue to scale as efficiently as possible. And so I think that it was a unique period of time, 12.5 years ago when clouds got started that allowed us the conditions and opportunities to build the company. I think it would be very challenging today for somebody to replicate the network that we have, and that network continues to allow us to deliver more and more services, whether that's our traditional application services, the act one products; our Zero Trust services, the act two products or even the super cloud products that we have with brokers, which are our act three products, all of those rely on that network and the efficiency that it has. And I think that's where the fundamental barrier to entry to our products is. The other thing which is important is we just experienced significant network effects, and that comes in a number of different ways. One is just with every piece of data that we see, we're able to make our security products significantly better. So the fact that consumer ISP is rolling us out to all of their customers that use their security bundle, that's just feeding data back into our system, which makes us smarter and smarter across that. But it's more than that. The fact that we are today somewhere in front of 20% to 25% of the web means that for customers that use our Zero Trust products, if they are going to that 20%, 25% of the web that uses us, then they never have to leave Cloudflare\u2019s network, and we can deliver a much more significant product. So as we are in front of more content and as we are in front of more eyeballs, that just makes the experience for both sides of that network better and better and that catalyzes the network effect, which, again, is very difficult for other competitors to catch up with. So we like our position. We like where we are for the next three years, and we continue to be committed to our goal of getting to $5 billion of run rate in five years from last quarter.\nJoel Fishbein: Really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We will now hear from Andrew Nowinski, Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. Congrats on the great quarter and the really strong guidance for the year. I wanted to start with a question on that big Fed deal. I know you mentioned a lot of interesting deals. I want to dig into the $7.2 million five-year deal with the Fed. First, I guess, will that be recognized as revenue ratably over the next five years? And do they bake in any sort of expansions that might not yet be included in that $7 million? Because it seems like that's -- certainly a lot of your big competitors are very strong in that space as well. So I was just curious like how it will progress, how you want it and what might also be down the road in that deal?\nThomas Seifert: Maybe I\u2019ll get started and there\u2019s no expansion baked into the deal. That's the deal we signed and that's the deal we announced. And if there is expansion opportunity, it will add to that opportunity. Revenue will be recognized ratably. It's a little bit more tricky. It's not necessarily linear over the contract period. It's the amount of entities that are signing up and how fast they are on our network. But for modeling purposes, to assume a ratable distribution over the lifetime of the contract is probably a good start.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you, Thomas. And then it looks like your channel momentum has continued and I think the channel accounted for about 13% of revenue this quarter, which is the highest it's ever been. I guess where are you seeing that traction from? Is that more from the GSIs or the traditional resellers?\nMatthew Prince: I think that channel remains a big opportunity for us, but we're proud of the progress that we've made and it's a real priority for Marc as he\u2019s there. I think that we're seeing both the traditional resellers as well as some of the GSIs that are increasingly adopting Cloudflare. And I think the big opportunity here is really with those act two and then to some extent, those act three products. And so we're seeing that in act two products, those are very much products that oftentimes we are winning in cooperation with a channel partner. And those initial wins help unlock future wins going forward. And then the second thing that we're seeing is that in our act three products, a lot of times, we're seeing as customers are coming to their partners to say, we're looking to consolidate vendors, we're looking to save money on some of our cloud spend that we're seeing more and more that Cloudflare is a solution that is in the toolkit for people who are trying to figure out how they can save money. So moving from an S3 to an R2 is a substantial savings. And we're seeing that even with some nontraditional partners. So someone like Palantir we announced a partnership with, they were driving a lot of their customers to their cloud solution. They saw how much money was wasted in some of the public clouds and so built a tool to help people understand what their cloud spend was. And they came to the conclusion that oftentimes, if customers could move more of their workloads to Cloudflare workers, that was a real money saving for them. And again, that's been -- it's early days but we think that that's definitely saving money, consolidating vendors. Those are all going to be trends throughout 2023, and we're very well positioned to be able to help partners as they work with their customers to take advantage of those trends.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you, guys. Congrats, Phil.\nOperator: Alex Henderson, Needham is up next.\nAlex Henderson: Thanks for the great print and welcome to have you on board, Phil. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the word at the end of the year here about how many coders are currently working on your platform and give us an update on that? I think that is the major positive strategic advantage that you have going to an earlier question.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, I think that we announced at the end of last year that we were -- that we crossed through 1 million developers that were building on Cloudflare workers. I don't know what the latest numbers are on that, but the growth rates have continued to drive more and more developers to that. And again, partnerships with companies like Shopify that have their own developer ecosystem just further accelerate the number of people who are using Cloudflare workers. And we're doing more and more. I think one of the exciting things that we announced yesterday was a very small team on our side, wanted to see if they could get Mastodon which is sort of the open source Federated, Twitter client to run on Cloudflare. And that's a fairly sophisticated application. And they built not only a way for them to deploy that for any developer to be able to deploy that on Cloudflare workers, but then it scales just beautifully where if you wanted to build kind of the next generation Twitter that just scales and scales and scales, they have proven that that can be done on top of Cloudflare workers. And so I think we are starting to see more and more sophisticated applications like that get built on workers, and that's an exciting development for us.\nAlex Henderson: The second question I wanted to address was your strategy around pricing. I know back in November, you raised prices for the first time and it was at a decade, which is amazing in and of itself. But can you talk about the magnitude of the pricing lever as we look at the full year for '23 and whether that is broader than just the low end entry fees?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that we were very hesitant and a little bit nervous about raising pricing. Cloudflare is fundamentally infrastructure for our clients, and we want to be reliable and predictable for them. And so we thought about this a lot. The primary goal of the price increase which was really only for our pay-as-you-go business, which is well less than 20% of Cloudflare revenue. But the primary goal was to shift that business from what was mostly a monthly payment business to one that was paid upfront and annually. So if you pay us upfront annually, you can keep the same price that we've had historically. And we were -- we obviously did all the work talking to users, figuring out what the tolerance was, but you have to sort of hold your breath and see what happens. And we've seen a handful of examples where I think with Slack, I think with Shopify, they\u2019ve had price increases that have gone over well. And we've seen a handful of price increases from companies where there's really been pushback that they've received. And I'm really happy that our customers, if anything, I think we were very pleasantly surprised how many of our customers said, over the course of the last 12 years, Cloudflare has added so much additional value that they want to pay us more. And so we've seen a substantial number of convert already to the annual billing, which is great because it's helped us pull forward some cash, which is important. And then the second is that those people who -- we had price increases for, and it was about a 25% price increase, that actually -- so it went from $20 to $25, so not 25%. That's misspeaking. But that was well received and we have not seen elevated churn as a result of that. It went about as smoothly as we could possibly have hoped.\nPhil Winslow: Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: And our final question today will come from Trevor Walsh, JMP Securities.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in and taking my question. Matthew, thanks for the color around the SLED business and congrats on hitting the FedRAMP certification. You've indicated that you thought 3% was I think low at only 3%. So just curious around that public sector business, kind of what you think the kind of the opportunities and maybe what held you back on that up to now? And if your sales and marketing, your new leaders there have kind of any plans to kind of help expand that part of the business. Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think we have had some business around --\nThomas Seifert: We just lost Matthew. I\u2019ll step in until he gets his line back. The Federal business, as you know, is a very local business. So getting all the certifications in place across the globe was one of the big targets. And we have made great progress both in Europe and now finally also here in the U.S. And as the certifications have been coming in and the products and the data centers get certified, we have been building up the teams in parallel, not only here in the U.S., but also outside of the U.S., especially in Europe, and we expect business to grow with it. And I would shy away from giving a concrete target or number for this year. But as you heard from Matthew, we think we have an overwhelming opportunity in front of us and now with the certifications in place and the team that gets hired, we are quite excited about this space. \nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thank you.\nThomas Seifert: I wanted to -- I think Alex was cut off on his last question. I think you wanted to find out how much of the price increase was baked in, in our guidance. I think it's fair to assume, and you can draw that conclusion from Matthew's comments, for this year it's probably more a tailwind to cash flow than it is a tailwind to revenue. Most of the customers have opted in to convert to annual billing and lock in the historic prices for one more year. So less of a tailwind for revenue, but more a tailwind of free cash flow for this year, at least.\nMatthew Prince: And apologies. My cell phone provider doesn't use Cloudflare it turns out. So my call dropped. That's a first. But I'm sure Thomas\u2019 answers were exactly right.\nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Did you have any closing remarks?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Sorry about the technical snafu. I really just wanted to end by thanking all of our customers, partners and especially the Cloudflare team. We have proven that we can do more even in very difficult economic times. I'm proud of all the work that we're doing to keep the Internet safe, secure, reliable for all of our customers around the world. So thank you for helping us deliver the quarter, and it's going to be a great 2023. I appreciate everyone being on the team.\nOperator: And everyone that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "I think we stick to our rule of trying to be prudent and thoughtful how we think about the future, especially in a rather uncertain environment. I think that the important takeaway in the guidance that we put forward is that we did not assume any help from the macroeconomic environment. We did not plan that things would get better. And we have a lot of initiatives that will accelerate sales productivity and accelerate growth, things that we can control. But we've been rather conservative there too in terms of what we anticipated in the guidance we gave. So I think it was our goal in a world where there are a lot of variables that shift around to find some ground of stability from which where we can build on moving forward. But I think prudent is what we said during COVID and thoughtful is what we said during COVID, and I think we stick to that philosophy, keeping our hands on the steering wheel as Matthew would call it and work on what we can control."

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. I want to take a moment to welcome Phil Winslow, our new VP of Strategic Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations to the team. As an influential equity research analyst who has been following Cloudflare even before our IPO, Phil brings a wealth of knowledge, expertise and relationships to his role at Cloudflare, and we are excited to have him on board. Turning to the fourth quarter. Economic uncertainty resulted in businesses being more cautious with their spending, leading to longer decision making processes and ultimately longer sales cycles during the quarter, pressuring revenue growth across the technology industry, including Cloudflare. However, we remain focused on controlling what is in our control, which is to maintain our commitment to the efficient unit economics of the business and to prudently allocate capital with a focus on maximizing shareholder value. As a result, we delivered a record quarter in terms of operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow. I'm particularly proud of our free cash flow performance during the fourth quarter, and we are committed to continuing to scale free cash flow generation going forward.  Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 42% year-over-year to $274.7 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 44% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 42% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 40% year-over-year.  Turning to our customer metrics in the fourth quarter. We had 162,086 paying customers, representing an addition of roughly 22,000 paying customers in 2022 and an increase of 16% year-over-year. We were pleased to see retention improve in the pay-as-you-go customer base in the fourth quarter returning to the levels we achieved in the late 2020 through early 2022. Turning to large customers. We ended the quarter with 2,042 large customers, representing an increase of 44% year-over-year and an addition of 134 large customers in the quarter. During the quarter, we also added a record number of net new customers paying us more than $500,000 a year.  As Matthew mentioned earlier, we are also pleased to see large customer revenue contribution increase again sequentially to 63% of revenue, up from 57% in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2022, large customers represented 61% of total revenue compared to 54% of total revenue in 2021 and 46% in 2020. For the full year, we are also breaking out large customers into cohorts of those who spend greater than $500,000 and $1 million. We ended the year with 222 customers that spent over $500,000 with us, an 83% increase year-over-year. We ended the year with 85 customers that spent over $1 million with us, a 52% increase year-over-year. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 122% during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 200 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 300 basis points year-over-year. We've not experienced elevated churn. Instead, similar to last quarter, the decline was primarily driven by less net expansion in customers spending less than $100,000 worth Cloudflare as well as pay-as-you-go customers. Conversely, our large customer net expansion was flat quarter-to-quarter and remains consistent with our average quarterly DNR for this customer segment since the end of 2019. We continue to expect DNR to trend upward over time to our long-term target of 130% plus. Also, we anticipate some variability from time to time particularly as customers are more cautious in their near-term spending, which, as I mentioned before, has impacted sales cycles. Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 77.4% and 78.2% for fiscal 2022, both of which remain above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. Network CapEx represented 10% of revenue in the fourth quarter. For full year 2022, network CapEx represented 11% of revenue as compared with our guidance at the beginning of the year at 12% to 14%, which demonstrates the flexibility, elasticity and scalability we have achieved in our network. For fiscal 2023, we expect network CapEx to be 11% to 13% of revenue.  Turning to operating expenses. Also their economic challenges for every business currently, we again took proactive measures during the fourth quarter to improve operational efficiency and control discretionary spending. As a result of these actions, fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year to 71%.  Our total number of employees increased 32% year-over-year bringing our total headcount to approximately 3,220 at the end of the quarter. We'll continue to pace hiring for the year based on current market conditions to deliver consistent results with a keen focus on allocating our talent to key strategic areas of the business to help us achieve our objective of $5 billion in annualized revenue in five years and to do so profitably, predictably and productively.  Sales and marketing expenses were $113 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased to 41% from 44% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $49.4 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased to 18% from 19% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1% sequentially and decreased to 12% from 14% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $16.8 million compared to an operating income of $2.3 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 6.1%, an increase of 490 basis points year-over-year. These results underscore our responsiveness to market conditions and our ability to scale up or scale down our spending as needed to meet demand, highlighting the efficiency and elasticity of our business model which remain key elements of Cloudflare's success.  Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $21.6 million or a dilutive net income per share of $0.06. Tax expense for the quarter was $2.3 million. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $33.7 million in the fourth quarter or 12% of revenue compared to $8.6 million or 4% of revenue in the same period last year.  Operating cash flow was $78.1 million in the fourth quarter or 28% of revenue compared to $40.6 million or 21% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $907 million, representing an increase of 9% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. Current RPO was 74% of total RPO.  Before moving to guidance for the first quarter and full year, I would like to begin with our expectations and the provisions we have factored into guidance. We performed rigorous scenario analysis across multiple vectors from pipeline and ACV growth to productivity in order to understand both our company-specific opportunities as well as the risks from the current economic uncertainty.  In our guidance, we have not factored in any improvement in the macroeconomic environment or from our go-to-market initiatives. Specifically, despite a notable improvement in our pipeline exiting 2022 as compared to with the first half of the year, we have assumed the increase in sales cycle, which we observed in the second half of last year, continues in 2023 and have, therefore, incorporated close rates below recent historical lows. Furthermore, as Matthew discussed earlier, we believe sales and marketing can be broken down into a series of processes that can be organized, measured and continuously optimized. Marc and Brent are establishing a consistent structure, model and process that simplifies how we operate and how we interact with prospects, customers and partners.  Because of the new leadership team we have already assembled has successfully executed these go-to-market playbooks before at other companies, we are confident in the ramp of implementing these models and tactics which we expect will ultimately improve revenue growth and productivity. However, we have not incorporated any improvement in sales productivity in our guidance for 2023, embedding in fact productivity levels below our recent historical lows.  Now turning to guidance for the first quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $290 million to $291 million, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $11.5 million to $12.5 million, and we expect diluted net income per share of $0.03 to $0.04, assuming approximately 342 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 36%. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.330 billion to $1.342 billion representing an increase of 37% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $54 million to $58 million, and we expect dilutive net income per share over this period in the range of $0.15 to $0.16, assuming approximately 344 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 36%. Beginning in 2023, Cloudflare is subject to be the [indiscernible] minimum tax, which is the primary driver for the increased tax rate year-over-year. After having achieved positive free cash flow in the second half of last year, we anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2023.  While we expect free cash flow to trend upward on an ongoing basis, for modeling purposes we anticipate near-term variability in our cash flow generation with the first half of 2023 expected to be relatively breakeven. We remain confident in the elasticity and durability of our business model, and we'll continue to pursue the enormous opportunity ahead of us while raising the bar on our operational excellence. In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers and partners. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. All of last year was a year where we did very active management of our expenses. And we reacted really early to the slowdown in the macro environment by slowing down our hiring, especially the velocity of hiring. And we'll stay committed to this course during the course of this year and align our spending to the development of the business. So there were a lot of companies out there during the season's earnings calls that talked about efficiencies. I always like to point out that efficiencies in the DNA of the company of Cloudflare, that is something that Matthew and Michelle already wrote in the founder letter for their prospects for the S1. So this is what you want to expect from us, not only for the first quarter, but for the remainder of this year as long as the environment is what it is. Maybe I'll get started and there's no expansion baked into the deal. That's the deal we signed and that's the deal we announced. And if there is expansion opportunity, it will add to that opportunity. Revenue will be recognized ratably. It's a little bit more tricky. It's not necessarily linear over the contract period. It's the amount of entities that are signing up and how fast they are on our network. But for modeling purposes, to assume a ratable distribution over the lifetime of the contract is probably a good start. We just lost Matthew. I'll step in until he gets his line back. The Federal business, as you know, is a very local business. So getting all the certifications in place across the globe was one of the big targets. And we have made great progress both in Europe and now finally also here in the U.S. And as the certifications have been coming in and the products and the data centers get certified, we have been building up the teams in parallel, not only here in the U.S., but also outside of the U.S., especially in Europe, and we expect business to grow with it. And I would shy away from giving a concrete target or number for this year. But as you heard from Matthew, we think we have an overwhelming opportunity in front of us and now with the certifications in place and the team that gets hired, we are quite excited about this space. I wanted to -- I think Alex was cut off on his last question. I think you wanted to find out how much of the price increase was baked in, in our guidance. I think it's fair to assume, and you can draw that conclusion from Matthew's comments, for this year it's probably more a tailwind to cash flow than it is a tailwind to revenue. Most of the customers have opted in to convert to annual billing and lock in the historic prices for one more year. So less of a tailwind for revenue, but more a tailwind of free cash flow for this year, at least."

            "content": "Thank you, Phil. It's great to have you on this side of the table. We had another strong quarter in spite of continued challenging macroeconomic conditions. We generated $274.7 million of revenue, up 42% year-over-year. We achieved a record operating profit of $16.8 million, representing an operating margin of over 6%.  While we continue to invest to capture the huge market ahead of us, we believe that during economic slowdowns, like the one we're in the midst of, it's important to show discipline and optimize for efficiency. We have our hands on the levers of our business and are adjusting them based on the macroeconomic conditions.  Our free cash flow in the quarter was $34 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 12% and allowing us to generate $29 million of free cash flow in the second half of 2022. While there will be some variability in our free cash flow quarterly, we expect to be free cash flow positive in 2023 and in the years after that. We achieved a gross margin over 77% above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%.  Our dollar-based net retention ticked down to 122%, while our gross renewal rates remain as high as ever, like others in the industry, we're seeing customers take longer to sign new and expansion deals with us. Procurement departments are definitely in the mode of measure two or three times before cutting one. We still see a clear path to dollar-based net retention over 130% as we ramp seat-based products, like Zero Trust and storage-based products like R2, and we won't be satisfied until we get there.  We added 134 large customers, those who pay us over $100,000 per year, and now have 2,042 large customers, including 33% of the Fortune 500. Revenue from large customers grew 56% year-over-year, and they now contribute 63% of our total revenue. We were fortunate that given our visibility into the overall Internet traffic and e-commerce trends, we started to see a slowdown in the economy all the way back in December of 2021.  Based on that, around this time last year, we began slowing our pace of hiring to ensure we didn't get over our skis. That paid off and kept us from having to take more drastic actions like many of our peers. It's also given us the ability to sensibly invest in our team as amazing talent comes on the market. To give you some sense, in 2022, we have over 400,000 people apply for approximately 1,300 positions at Cloudflare. That demand to work at Cloudflare has allowed us to continue to hire incredible talent while remaining disciplined in overall compensation.  We are committed to incremental equity compensation dilution well below many of our peers targeting less than 3% net burn rate annually. Tough economic times like these make you assess your strengths and weaknesses. Cloudflare has long had a product and engineering team that delivered an innovation engine that is the envy of the industry. Jen Taylor, who leads that team, briefed me recently on everything we have lined up for the year ahead, and the engine is definitely not slowing down.  Our next innovation week is in March with security week, where we'll be launching a number of new products and feature enhancements, especially around our Zero Trust products. While our innovation engine is the best in the industry and has unlocked $125 billion total addressable market we have ahead of us, if we're honest with ourselves, our go-to-market organization hasn't yet been fully optimized.  As our product become more complicated and we are selling to larger and larger customers, it's increasingly clear that we need to step up our game in marketing and sales. I introduced Marc Boroditsky who joined last quarter to lead our sales organization. Last week, he briefed me and Michelle on his first 100 days. My initial reaction, if I'm honest, was embarrassment over some of the basic things we should have been doing better. But my second reaction was excitement as there are so many opportunities for us to improve.  In addition to Marc, Brent Remai joined us last quarter to lead our marketing team. Brent was previously CMO at FireEye and CMO of Core Services at AWS. His career perfectly prepared him for Cloudflare's delivery of cloud security services. We've seen early results of Brent's team generating pipeline in Q4 and January Q1, coming in ahead of our targets.  We've been leaders on the product and engineering side. Now we're focusing on becoming a leader in the go-to-market side as well. I hear the excitement from our existing sales and marketing teams at the rigor and discipline Marc and Brent are bringing to those teams. And what I'm watching carefully is another important pipeline, the pipeline of new sales talent. We're seeing incredible people from the leading sales team in the world apply to work at Cloudflare. We aim for nothing less than to build one of the leading sales organizations in the world. That's all exciting. And while I believe there's a substantial opportunity for us to improve our go-to-market engine, I'm also cognizant that these efforts can take time. That's why we're not relying on any improvement in sales or marketing efficiency or any rebound in the economy as we look at the year ahead and formulate our guidance.  So focusing on the present, let me highlight some customer wins from the quarter. A Fortune 500 energy company signed a three-year $1.6 million deal that was a takeout of a first-generation Zero Trust networking competitor. We are placing both their Secure Web Gateway and Zero Trust network access products. Because the competitor's network is actually broken into multiple distinct clouds as compared with our unified network, their reliability and performance were underperforming the customers' expectations. We were able to replace the competitor's feature set and more. The customer ultimately purchased gateway, access, remote browser isolation and DNS filtering. The customer was attracted to our better pricing, performance and ease of use as well as the single pane of glass manageability of our platform. We worked with a large channel partner to win and service this customer and expect we'll be doing more with them going forward.  A Fortune 500 financial services company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $1.1 million deal, a [indiscernible] Cloudflare customer since 2014 using our core application services. Like we're hearing from many of our customers, they wanted to consolidate vendors, reduce costs and have more flexibility and control over their traffic flows as well as implementing a Zero Trust architecture. They wanted to move away from legacy on-premise hardware to modern cloud-based services. The customer loves that we have a single pane of glass solution and that our technology is built from the ground up on a single platform rather than a Frankenstein solution bolted together through M&A. They purchased access, gateway, remote browser isolation, Magic WAN and Magic Firewall. They're a terrific customer.  A Fortune 500 telecom signed a $400,000 one-year deal to bring a portion of Cloudflare's Zero Trust services to their consumer base. They're bundling Cloudflare's DNS content filtering into their consumer security bundle. After evaluating competition, they found Cloudflare solutions to be the most secure and reliable in the market. This deal is not only valuable for the obvious reasons, but also because it will feed data back to our Zero Trust security products to further extend their lead over the competition.  A leading generative AI company signed a one-year $1 million deal. The company had been a user of our free tier since 2017. And this deal originally started out as a relatively small gateway DNS opportunity to replace Cisco Umbrella. However, when their browser-based application debuted in late November, demand for the company's AI-generated content absolutely exploded with unprecedented rates of adoption.  Their Azure Front Door had quickly proved insufficient at handling the massive load on their services from legitimate users as well as keeping fraudulent users from exhausting their resources. They started off with CVM, DDoS, bot management, gateway DNS and more. We are actively exploring various paths for expansion to support their incredible growth as well as emerging use cases of their AI models and applications with Cloudflare Worker, API Shield, imagery sizing and more. We saw success with other AI companies in the quarter as well. Given the resource constraints they all face as well as how attractive they are as a target to fraudulent users, Cloudflare security solutions are an obvious choice for all of them. But many of them came to us for other reasons as well. AI companies, in particular, need to find wherever it's most cost effective to run their models across multiple different cloud providers. They are, by their very nature, multi-cloud, but the data egress policies make it prohibitive to move large training sets between the clouds. Enter Cloudflare Worker.  What we're finding with these AI companies is that R2 and other workers' products naturally become the glue at the center of a multi-cloud ecosystem. R2 has become the natural neutral place for these AI companies to store their training data in order to make sure it can be inexpensively and efficiently accessed from anywhere. It's obvious in retrospect. But it's a use case we didn't anticipate. Today, our largest R2 customer is another AI company using us for exactly the purpose of being a neutral place to store their training data. And, of course, being a neutral network super cloud that stitches together the traditional public cloud isn't a problem exclusive to AI. A European financial services company signed a five-year $1.8 million deal, replacing a dozen different security and network vendors with Cloudflare. This company settles hundreds of millions of securities transactions annually for the largest banks and governments in the world. As a result, security and regulatory compliance are paramount for them. They wanted to consolidate and simplify their numerous point solutions into a single pane of glass solution.  After receiving regulatory approval, the customer signed on for multiple solutions across our core application services portfolio as well as both Zero Trust and network services in Cloudflare One, including access, DNS filtering and Magic Transit. In addition to consolidating their spend across multiple point solution vendors on to Cloudflare's broad platform, our data localization suite, in particular, won them over. Competing vendors simply do not have an equivalent solution. As companies increasingly face localization and data residency requirements becoming law in various geographies, our differentiated data localization suite is becoming more and more critical to customers.  A public utility company in Africa signed a $2.8 million 75-month deal to help support a really cool industrial IoT rollout. They're using Cloudflare's intelligent network to monitor 3,300 sensors, tracking shipments of materials. This is another use case of Cloudflare's network we wouldn't have imagined on our own, but one we're uniquely positioned to deliver for the customer and now opens even more markets and opportunities.  The state of North Carolina signed a three-year, $3 million deal. The state had originally come to us under our Athenian Project for free help with election security. They learned the power of Cloudflare using us to protect their elections infrastructure and signed the deal to expand Cloudflare's protection across 50 state agencies. Finally, I'm happy to report that after our longer than expected wait at the proverbial DMV, we officially received Cloudflare's FedRAMP certification. The certification covers nearly our full suite of products with a notable exception of Area 1 e-mail security product, which we acquired after we started the FedRAMP process, but we expect to add it to our certification at the FedRAMP renewal. Our first federal contract after our certification was a great start.  We were awarded the $7.2 million, five-year deal to operate the .gov registry. We were awarded the contract because of our modern infrastructure, technical prowess, relentless innovation and proven ability to defend against the largest cyber attacks. Every e-mail sent to the White House, every agency's webpage and most of the other ways the U.S. government connects to the Internet now depend on Cloudflare and our network. We're proud to have won this business, but the public sector space is only 3% of our revenue today, so we believe it's only the beginning of what we'll be doing in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. Yes. I think that we are really happy with our win rates. What I think our challenge is in the Zero Trust space is not winning customers that know about us, but making sure that customers that are in the market for Zero Trust services are aware that that's something we do. The frustration that I still have is when I'll meet with a customer and oftentimes they'll literally say, you should build something that is in the Zero Trust space, competing with Zscaler or Palo Alto Networks. And so when we're in those deals, we find ourselves winning very often. I think we are especially successful with very technical rigorous companies that measure performance and care about making sure that they have the best possible end user and especially developer experience. But our challenge now, and what Brent and Marc are really focused on, is how in that space do we increase our awareness? And I think you're going to see a lot of us doing that. But when we're in the deal, we tend to have very, very strong win rates that rival what we see from our other products. Yes. So the way that we've been -- the way that it has sort of been the natural way that we thought companies like AI companies would consume Cloudflare would be looking at our security products. And those are products that, as you said, are subscription-based and there's some opportunity there, but there really aren't yet that many AI companies. So that opportunity is fine. But I don't think it's anything that we would get really excited about. I think what we're seeing though is in that cluster of AI companies, they have a real use case for the cloud which is somewhat different than what we see from some other companies. It is, I would say, more forward leaning and that is that they are constantly looking for wherever the best model or wherever the cheapest GPUs are to process their data. And so they are looking around across multiple different cloud providers, whether that's Google or Microsoft or AWS and they're always saying, what can we take advantage of and get as much out of that as possible. And what the challenge for them is, is the AI training sets or these big lumps of data that they then have to sort of bring to wherever the model or bring to wherever that GPU is. And in that case, a lot of the workers products and, in particular, our R2 product, are a very natural way that they can put the data in one neutral location and then be able to access it all around in other locations as well. And what we're seeing is that that neutral position of R2 is actually not just appealing for people in the AI space, but for anyone that has shared data that they want to use not in just one cloud but across multiple different clouds. And so I think by having a way to embed data into the network and store data into the network, that is an opportunity for us to service anybody who is trying to be multi-cloud, which is frankly what every big enterprise today is doing. And in that case, R2 is very much a consumption-based product. And so as AI data sets get larger and larger, we expect that we will be able to grow R2 revenue along with that. And actually, our largest R2 customers, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is an AI company and they're growing at just extraordinary rates as they put more data into their models. I think that we are not looking for anything exotic here. I think, again, prudence is very much the sort of word of the quarter for us. And I think that we're not sort of counting on something that is the new hot thing doubling down on Cloudflare. And so while we're very proud of what we have done with companies in the AI space, and we're excited about the ramp in products like R2 and the overall workers ecosystem, we still think of that more as a long-term opportunity than a short-term quarterly or even 2023 opportunity. And so I think that we're not relying on sort of an AI miracle in order to make the numbers that we put up. Yes, Jim. So I'll start and then Thomas can take the second part. I think we're really happy with the ramps of these new products. Cloudflare, we've always thought of ourselves as stacking S curves one behind another. And so I always think of sort of our application services products as sort of our first act. We think of our Zero Trust products as our second act. And we think of our workers products as our third act. And so I think that they're maturing at rates that continue to make us very excited and happy and we're seeing more and more new use cases that are coming from that. I think some of the trade-offs around DNR have been interesting here. One of the things that we really talked about last quarter optimizing for was just on how we did cash collections and converting customers to paying upfront. And I think that one of the things that we made a trade-off on was at times saying we would optimize for getting more customers to be paying us upfront. And that might not allow us to expand those customers as much in this quarter. And I think that's the right thing for us to do. We want to optimize in these times, making sure that we can collect cash as quickly as possible, can be paid upfront as much as possible. That continues to be an ongoing effort for us. But I think that that was more of a drag on DNR. I think you'll start to see as those new products come online that those will be positive. But remember that DNR only starts to kick in for a customer that's been with us for an entire year. So for those products that are new, even if they are wildly successful, the expansion won't actually show up in our numbers until 12 months after the products were actually in the market. Yes. So Shopify has been a terrific Cloudflare customer for a number of our different products, including workers. And I think, look, we've talked about in previous calls is that one of the most effective ways for us to sort of turbocharge the adoption of workers is to work with other great partners that have an existing developer ecosystem. And so we were proud that Shopify has really standardized around Cloudflare workers. We've worked with them to make sure that we are doing the right things for the overall community that we open source, for example, the run time of workers. And I think that as you see companies like that adopt workers for their developer platform that that's a real opportunity for us to, again, turbocharge what workers is and make sure that more and more developers are on top of it. And what's incredible is just watching how as again we get more reps with really talented and smart engineering teams like the team at Shopify, that's just making the workers platform better for everyone involved. And again, we're really proud to have them as a customer. Yes. I want to be careful that I might misspeak, but I don't believe that Area 1 was included in that particular deal. So that's still an expansion opportunity with that customer. We do see that e-mail security is a terrific entry into getting people to move to our Zero Trust platform. The reason why is that Zero Trust one is the first challenges is enumerating how many people are within an organization, how many seats effectively does that organization make up. And if we can get somebody to use our e-mail security product, that inherently defines that in a very natural way. And so migrating somebody from sort of our application services portfolio to our e-mail security portfolio is one click. It's a simple DNS change. And they don't have to -- they can continue to use any of their existing e-mail vendors, and we effectively just proxy that traffic and are able to provide additional layers and enhancement of security as well. Once we've done that, it then makes it a very natural step to go from the e-mail security product to the rest of our Zero Trust suite. And so that is a standard play that we run. It's very successful. But in the case of this particular oil and gas company, it wasn't the reason that they adopted us for Zero Trust. But hopefully, we can go the other direction as well. And Joel, by barriers to entry, do you mean for competitors competing against us or what exactly do you mean by that? Sure. So I think the thing that is at the core of Cloudflare is our network, the reason that our ticker is NET and not CLOFLARE [ph] is because of the fact that we are fundamentally a network. And that network has taken us over 12 years to build. And it is not something that you can just throw money at and buy your way into, it's not something that even some of the large hyper-scale public clouds have. And so we hear regularly from companies like Microsoft that they're like, wow, you guys have something very special in the network you've built, and it is very different than anything else that's out there. But somewhat counterintuitive a bit about our network is that as we expand into further corners of universe, whether that's opening an additional data center in St. Louis or going into Djibouti, any of those things actually help us lower our costs because it drives down the cost of delivering all of our services. And the other important bit is that unlike some of the competitors that are out there, whether those are competitors in the application services space that have grown through a series of M&A acquisitions or even in the Zero Trust space, someone like Zscaler actually runs multiple independent networks to provide their various services. And that means that customers that are using those different services not only is it more inefficient for them to service those customers, but those customers experience very performance setbacks when they're delivering their services. And that's something that a lot of the customers that are switching from Zscaler to us note time and time again. What's different about us is we have relentlessly said that we run one single network. And every single server across our entire network is capable of running and performing any of the functions that we may need it for. And so that means that as we grow our services, it allows us to deliver them incredibly quickly, incredibly efficiently and anywhere in the world, and that is paying off today by allowing us to continue to scale as efficiently as possible. And so I think that it was a unique period of time, 12.5 years ago when clouds got started that allowed us the conditions and opportunities to build the company. I think it would be very challenging today for somebody to replicate the network that we have, and that network continues to allow us to deliver more and more services, whether that's our traditional application services, the act one products; our Zero Trust services, the act two products or even the super cloud products that we have with brokers, which are our act three products, all of those rely on that network and the efficiency that it has. And I think that's where the fundamental barrier to entry to our products is. The other thing which is important is we just experienced significant network effects, and that comes in a number of different ways. One is just with every piece of data that we see, we're able to make our security products significantly better. So the fact that consumer ISP is rolling us out to all of their customers that use their security bundle, that's just feeding data back into our system, which makes us smarter and smarter across that. But it's more than that. The fact that we are today somewhere in front of 20% to 25% of the web means that for customers that use our Zero Trust products, if they are going to that 20%, 25% of the web that uses us, then they never have to leave Cloudflare's network, and we can deliver a much more significant product. So as we are in front of more content and as we are in front of more eyeballs, that just makes the experience for both sides of that network better and better and that catalyzes the network effect, which, again, is very difficult for other competitors to catch up with. So we like our position. We like where we are for the next three years, and we continue to be committed to our goal of getting to $5 billion of run rate in five years from last quarter. I think that channel remains a big opportunity for us, but we're proud of the progress that we've made and it's a real priority for Marc as he's there. I think that we're seeing both the traditional resellers as well as some of the GSIs that are increasingly adopting Cloudflare. And I think the big opportunity here is really with those act two and then to some extent, those act three products. And so we're seeing that in act two products, those are very much products that oftentimes we are winning in cooperation with a channel partner. And those initial wins help unlock future wins going forward. And then the second thing that we're seeing is that in our act three products, a lot of times, we're seeing as customers are coming to their partners to say, we're looking to consolidate vendors, we're looking to save money on some of our cloud spend that we're seeing more and more that Cloudflare is a solution that is in the toolkit for people who are trying to figure out how they can save money. So moving from an S3 to an R2 is a substantial savings. And we're seeing that even with some nontraditional partners. So someone like Palantir we announced a partnership with, they were driving a lot of their customers to their cloud solution. They saw how much money was wasted in some of the public clouds and so built a tool to help people understand what their cloud spend was. And they came to the conclusion that oftentimes, if customers could move more of their workloads to Cloudflare workers, that was a real money saving for them. And again, that's been -- it's early days but we think that that's definitely saving money, consolidating vendors. Those are all going to be trends throughout 2023, and we're very well positioned to be able to help partners as they work with their customers to take advantage of those trends. Yes, I think that we announced at the end of last year that we were -- that we crossed through 1 million developers that were building on Cloudflare workers. I don't know what the latest numbers are on that, but the growth rates have continued to drive more and more developers to that. And again, partnerships with companies like Shopify that have their own developer ecosystem just further accelerate the number of people who are using Cloudflare workers. And we're doing more and more. I think one of the exciting things that we announced yesterday was a very small team on our side, wanted to see if they could get Mastodon which is sort of the open source Federated, Twitter client to run on Cloudflare. And that's a fairly sophisticated application. And they built not only a way for them to deploy that for any developer to be able to deploy that on Cloudflare workers, but then it scales just beautifully where if you wanted to build kind of the next generation Twitter that just scales and scales and scales, they have proven that that can be done on top of Cloudflare workers. And so I think we are starting to see more and more sophisticated applications like that get built on workers, and that's an exciting development for us. Yes. I think that we were very hesitant and a little bit nervous about raising pricing. Cloudflare is fundamentally infrastructure for our clients, and we want to be reliable and predictable for them. And so we thought about this a lot. The primary goal of the price increase which was really only for our pay-as-you-go business, which is well less than 20% of Cloudflare revenue. But the primary goal was to shift that business from what was mostly a monthly payment business to one that was paid upfront and annually. So if you pay us upfront annually, you can keep the same price that we've had historically. And we were -- we obviously did all the work talking to users, figuring out what the tolerance was, but you have to sort of hold your breath and see what happens. And we've seen a handful of examples where I think with Slack, I think with Shopify, they've had price increases that have gone over well. And we've seen a handful of price increases from companies where there's really been pushback that they've received. And I'm really happy that our customers, if anything, I think we were very pleasantly surprised how many of our customers said, over the course of the last 12 years, Cloudflare has added so much additional value that they want to pay us more. And so we've seen a substantial number of convert already to the annual billing, which is great because it's helped us pull forward some cash, which is important. And then the second is that those people who -- we had price increases for, and it was about a 25% price increase, that actually -- so it went from $20 to $25, so not 25%. That's misspeaking. But that was well received and we have not seen elevated churn as a result of that. It went about as smoothly as we could possibly have hoped. Yes. I think we have had some business around -- And apologies. My cell phone provider doesn't use Cloudflare it turns out. So my call dropped. That's a first. But I'm sure Thomas' answers were exactly right. Yes. Sorry about the technical snafu. I really just wanted to end by thanking all of our customers, partners and especially the Cloudflare team. We have proven that we can do more even in very difficult economic times. I'm proud of all the work that we're doing to keep the Internet safe, secure, reliable for all of our customers around the world. So thank you for helping us deliver the quarter, and it's going to be a great 2023. I appreciate everyone being on the team."

We would also like to inform you that we will be participating in the RBC Capital Markets Global Technology, Internet, Media and Telecommunications Conference on November 16 and the Credit Suisse 26th Annual Technology Conference on November 30. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jayson. We had a strong quarter, even as the economic environment has continued to be challenging. We generated $254 million in revenue, up 47% year-over-year. Unsurprisingly, the slowdown in the economy we discussed on the last 2 earnings calls is starting to show up on our top line revenue numbers. Even with those economic headwinds, this quarter marked a milestone for us, crossing through $1 billion in annualized revenue. Only 6% of public software companies achieved this milestone, so we're proud to have crossed it, but nowhere close to finished.  We added 4,197 paying customers for a total of 156,000 paying customers. For large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, we added 159 new large customers for a total of 1,908, up 51% year-over-year. Large customers now account for 61% of revenue. And our large customers keep getting larger. The number of customers over $500,000 in annual spend grew 88% year-over-year, and customers over $1 million grew 63% year-over-year.  Even with inflation hitting some of our costs, our gross margin held strong at 78.1%, still above our target gross margin range of 75% to 77%. We achieved a record operating profit of $14.8 million, representing an operating margin of 5.8%. We are confident we can deliver meaningful operating margins over time, but continue to plan to hold them near breakeven as long as we're able to deliver exceptional revenue growth.  Our dollar-based net retention in the quarter was 124%, flat year-over-year and down from 126% last quarter. While there is some noise in that number based on when contracts renew, we will continue to be dissatisfied until it's over 130%, and we believe that it's still very achievable as we add seats and storage-based products like Zero Trust and R2.  We are proud to have crossed through $1 billion in annualized revenue, but it has us thinking about our next milestones. While there are economic challenges for every business in the near-term, we know that the opportunity Cloudflare has ahead of the long-term is massive. Even as we achieve $1 billion, we have penetrated less than 1% of our identified market for products we already have available today.  That's why we're confident. We're on the path to organically achieve $5 billion in annualized revenue over the next 5 years. Less than 1% of all public software companies reach the $5 billion milestone. And while today's global economy will continue to present headwinds in the quarters ahead, as we look further out, we are confident we have the products already in market to get us there.  Crossing the $1 billion milestone is also an opportunity to reflect on our team. It's a natural normal process to have different leaders for different stages in the company's life. Earlier this year, Chris Merritt, who runs our sales team, reached out to me and Michelle to say that, while he wasn't in a hurry, he thought it made sense for someone else to take us to the next milestone past $1 billion.  Chris himself is a unicorn. He started at Cloudflare almost 10 years ago as our first sales hire. We grew our revenue from 0 to $1 billion. I've tried to count the number of sales leaders who have accomplished that, and have come up with fewer than 10 across all the history of software. I wanted to give Chris the floor for a second to recognize him and all he's accomplished and helped us build at Cloudflare.\nChris Merritt: Thanks, Matthew. I remember meeting with Michelle all the way back in 2013 as Cloudflare was looking for someone to build its sales organization. It was very clear from that very first meeting that the opportunity Cloudflare had was just incredible.  Fast forward to present day, and I'm so proud of the team we've built that brings Cloudflare's products to market to solve real problems for our customers. It is a truly world-class organization doing amazing work.  And as Matthew said, I had a terrific run, and I decided the $1 billion mark was the right time for me to transition out and bring in another leader for the next phase of Cloudflare's growth. I worked closely with the team to help identify the great leader we found to do that, and I'll continue to be involved to help with a smooth transition through at least the end of the year.  What a great 10-year journey it's been, and I'll always believe the Cloudflare orange. Back to you, Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thanks, Chris. We couldn't have gotten here without you. As Chris said, he worked closely with us over the last several months to identify the right person to lead our sales team going forward. The person we found is terrific. He understands enterprise sales from his time as a senior leader at Oracle, can help accelerate our Zero Trust go-to-market based on his experience in the identity and access management space, cracks the desire to developers as we turn workers into a massive business and recently led sales for Twilio, another Software-as-a-Service company, which grew more than 50% organically compounded during its tenure to a $4 billion annualized run rate.  Marc Boroditsky is uniquely qualified to take us to our next milestone and beyond. I wanted to give him the floor to talk a bit about why he joined Cloudflare.\nMarc Boroditsky: Thank you, Matthew. I've been on the team now for a little over a week, and I couldn't be more thrilled. I was very fortunate to attend Cloudflare's recent Customer Day in San Francisco. In all my years at similar events, I've never seen more engaged customers of all types who are eager to do more with us as a strategic partner.  Let me tell you what's especially compelling about Cloudflare, is the breadth of solutions that are a part of our platform today. We don't need to go out and buy companies. We don't need to invent new technologies. I see a clear path to $5 billion in 5 years simply by selling what we already have in the bag to the customers that already know us. That's an incredible opportunity in what compelled me to join the Cloudflare team. Back to you, Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thanks, Marc. We are excited for you to build on the great team Chris has put in place and further mature our go-to-market efforts as we sell more products to larger and larger customers. With that set up, let me tell you about some customer wins last quarter.  A Fortune 500 technology financial services company signed a 1-year $2.8 million contract. They faced an increasing number of sophisticated cyber attacks. They compared us against nearly all of our competitors. While the competitors tried to offer lower pricing, it didn't matter. This company was so convinced that we were the clear technical leader that they paid a premium for our services. They see the value of our integrated approach, and are now evaluating us to be their Zero Trust provider as well.  A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare. They signed an additional $915,000 3-year deal, bringing their total contract over that period with us to $7.4 million. They're adopting our data localization suite, powered by Cloudflare Workers. This product allows customers to process data locally in the countries where their customers reside. These features are unique in the industry to Cloudflare and increasingly important to highly regulated customers like this one.  A Fortune 500 European telecom signed a 3-year $1.2 million deal. The customer was moving more of their security services from on-premise hardware to the cloud. While they evaluated our security services as best of breed, the show stopper for them again was our data localization suite. None of the other vendors they considered, including the hyperscale public cloud, had an equivalent solution. We're seeing more and more EU companies adopting Cloudflare in order to meet the increasing data localization and data residency requirements becoming law in the region. A Fortune 500 retailer expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a $442,000 deal and bringing their annual commitment to nearly $1 million. They are using Workers to build highly scalable functions across their e-commerce application. They're also using Cloudflare's network to route traffic between different hyperscale public cloud vendors they use. Seeing multi-cloud is a priority for them, and Cloudflare is the only vendor they see it being able to help them achieve their vision. They have started experiments with R2, our object store, and D1 our first database. While their spend is still modest, we think there's an opportunity, and they've expressed interest in making us one of their strategic vendors going forward.  A Fortune 500 life sciences conglomerate signed a $745,000 3-year deal. They use a range of our products, including Magic Transit, to better protect their on-premise data centers. They're handing traffic directly to our network, completely replacing their ISP. We've signed an MSA with them, and believe there's a significant opportunity to expand across their other 20 subsidiaries.  A Fortune 500 apparel company signed a 3-year $1.1 million deal. They bought our full set of security services, as well as Cloudflare Workers. A fun fact is that my cofounder, Michelle had an opportunity to be this company's CEO's chief of staff out of business school. Instead, she chose to start Cloudflare, and now their customers.  A Fortune 500 consumer product company expanded their relationship with us, signing an additional $292,000 1-year deal. That brings their total spend with us to nearly $1 million per year. They are using our Zero Trust product, and we worked with a large channel partner to win and service them as a customer.  A Fortune 500 financial services company signed a $236,000 1-year deal. We believe this will be another example of how we can land with 1 product, sign a general MSA and then expand over time.  If you've been counting, that's [indiscernible] Fortune 500 companies, and we're actually up to 32% of the Fortune 500 now using us. I see a clear path to nearly every Fortune 500 company using us for something in the next 5 years. And a big part of Marc and the team's job then is to expand those relationships and then get them to use us for everything.  We aim to be the network for every Fortune 500 company. But not just the Fortune 500. In Q3, a large building materials manufacturer in Europe signed a $1.2 million 31-month expansion deal. They have broadly adopted our Zero Trust products across their 25,000 employees. They have been hit by a ransomware attack earlier this year that their existing e-mail security vendor failed to catch. We included our Area 1 e-mail security product as part of their Zero Trust solution, something no other Zero Trust vendor provides as a native integration.  During our POC, we cut phishing messages that our other existing vendors miss. They went from POC to live in 2 days, and signed a deal a week later. They've been a small customer previously, but turned to us for an integrated solution the minute they had another network security need. And we delivered.  Finally, a large software monitoring company signed a $3.6 million expansion deal, bringing their annual spend to more than $5 million. They're a big user of Cloudflare Workers, processing 7 trillion requests just in September. They are migrating more and more of their applications from AWS to Cloudflare Workers for our performance and easy scalability.  In a few weeks, we have our upcoming Developer Innovation Week, where we'll be announcing some incredible new Cloudflare Workers milestone, but I couldn't resist sharing a few here now.  As of the end of Q3, we're up to 2.2 million unique applications running on Cloudflare Workers. Cloudflare Pages, which is a product within the Cloudflare Workers portfolio, is up to 367,000 projects and has doubled since May.  In September, we announced that R2 is now generally available, along with our other generally available storage products, Workers KV and Worker [indiscernible]. We are now scoring over a petabyte of customer data. And before the end of the quarter, D1, our first database product, will be available in open beta.  Increasingly, we're hearing about more and more start-up companies that are skipping the hyperscale public cloud and building exclusively on Workers. Reflecting that trend in September, we announced the Workers LaunchPad Funding program, in which 26 of the top venture capitalists collectively earmarked up to $1.25 billion in funding for innovative new start-ups building on Cloudflare Workers. The funding program came about because DCs kept coming to us to do due diligence on companies they were considering investing in when more and more of their tech stacks were powered exclusively by Cloudflare Workers.  So from the Fortune 500 to the hottest new startups, increasingly, the future seems powered by Cloudflare Workers. I wanted to close by reminding everyone in the United States that we have an election next Tuesday. That makes this a time of heightened cybersecurity concerns for the country. Through Cloudflare's Athenian project, we provide our services for free to any state and local officials who help oversee election. Today, election authorities in more than half of U.S. states and most of the so-called ballot graph states are participants in the Athenian project. We are proud that we help cyberattacks not be part of the story in the 2020 election, and we have had our team standing by, and they'll be available 24/7 over the next week to help ensure cyberattacks won't be part of the story for 2022 either.  So we'll do the thing we're best at, you don't forget to vote. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. As Matthew mentioned, we achieved an important milestone in the third quarter, surpassing $1 billion revenue run rate for the first time. This milestone is a testament to our enormous market opportunity, our ability to land and expand large enterprise customers and the durability of our subscription-based revenue model.  Turning to revenue for the quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 47% year-over-year to $253.9 million. Area 1, the e-mail security company we acquired in April, again contributed less than 1% of revenue this quarter.  While we are seeing foreign exchange headwinds and global economic uncertainty impact the business, we continue that traction upmarket and believe we are very well positioned in this environment.  From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 53% of revenue, and increased 49% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue, and increased 51% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue, and increased 38% year-over-year. The APAC performance has improved meaningfully from last year, but we are seeing more price sensitivity and buying decision delays in the APAC region.  Turning to our customer metrics. In the third quarter, we had 156,000 paying customers, representing an increase of 18% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we saw a higher level of churn in our pay-as-you-go customer base, primarily due to more customers shifting down to our free customer tier. We think this is a function of a more challenging macro environment. However, we are pleased to see these customers to remain on our platform.  Turning to large customers. We ended the quarter with 1,908 large customers, representing an increase of 51% year-over-year and an addition of 159 large customers in the quarter. We were pleased to see large customer revenue contribution increase again sequentially.  We are also encouraged to see the quality of wins continue to increase across the Fortune 500 in a broad array of verticals, including consumer, retail, health care, life science, pharmaceutical, industrial, telco and financial services. While sales cycles at the high end of the business have elongated, we continue to see our $500,000-plus and $1 million plus cohort scoring faster than top line revenue. We also achieved a milestone of 75 customers larger than $1 million in the third quarter.  Our dollar-based net retention was 124%, representing a decrease of 200 basis points sequentially and consistent year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by less net expansion we have not seen elevated churn.  As we mentioned previously, while we expect DNR to continue to trend upward over time, we expect some variability quarter-to-quarter. We continue to target 130%-plus dollar-based net retention rate given our momentum with large enterprise customers and the net expansion characteristics of seed-based solutions.  Moving to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin was 78.1%, representing a decrease of 80 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 13% of revenue in the third quarter. We expect fiscal 2022 network CapEx to come in at the lower end of the 12% to 14% range due to the timing of purchases and inherent efficiencies in the network.  Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 7% sequentially and 6% year-over-year to 72%. Our total number of employees increased 42% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to approximately 3,180 at the end of the quarter. We will continue to invest in the business. So as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to pace hiring based on current market conditions.  Sales and marketing expenses were $103.5 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 3% sequentially, and decreased to 41% from 45% in the same quarter last year.  Research and development expenses were $46.4 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and decreased to 18% from 19% in the same quarter last year.  General and administrative expenses were $33.6 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2% sequentially, and decreased to 13% from 14% in the same quarter last year.  Operating income was $14.8 million compared to an operating income of $2.2 million in the same period last year. Third quarter operating margin was 5.8%, an increase of 450 basis points year-over-year. Overseas operating expenses benefited from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which contributed to the increase in operating profit.  Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $19.1 million or net income per share of $0.06. Tax expenses for the quarter was $1.7 million. We ended the third quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $4.6 million in the third quarter or 2% of revenue, compared to negative $39.7 million or 23% of revenue in the same period last year.  Operating cash flow was $42.7 million in the third quarter or 17% of revenue, compared to $6.9 million or 4% of revenue in the same period last year. As stated previously, we continue to expect to be free cash flow positive in the second half of 2022.  Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $831 million, representing an increase of 9% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. Before moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year, I would like to reiterate our expectations in light of the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. While we saw a foreign exchange benefit to operating expenses, we also saw FX headwinds to revenue as we offer concessions to offset the strength of the U.S. dollar internationally.  In the quarter, we observed an increase in our sales cycle and expect similar sales dynamics to continue, leading to longer lead time deal closures. We are cognizant of the increasingly cautious environment and have factored this into our outlook.  Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $273.5 million to $274.5 million, representing an increase of 41% to 42% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $12 million to $13 million, and we expect net income per share of $0.04 to $0.05, assuming approximately 343 million common shares outstanding. And we expect a tax expense of $1.9 million.  For the full year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $974 million to $975 million, representing an increase of 48% to 49% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $31 million to $32 million, and we expect net income per share over that period in the range of $0.11 to $0.12, assuming approximately 342 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $6.1 million. Although challenges remain in the current environment, we are confident in the continued growth of our business and the durability of our subscription model.  Before closing, I would like to let you know that Jayson Nolan, our Head of Strategic Finance and Investor Relations, is leaving us. This is happy and sad news. Happy for him to pursue his first CFO opportunity at a pre-IPO software company, but sad to lose such an integral member of the team. I want to thank him personally for his leadership and partnership, and wish him great success in his next chapter.  In closing, I'd like to thank Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication in delivering exceptional service to our customers, partners and communities. And as Matthew mentioned, now that we have reached a $1 billion revenue run rate, we are setting our sights on the next milestones of $5 billion in 5 years.  With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will go first to Phil Winslow, Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: One for Matthew and then a follow-up for Michelle and Thomas. Matthew, obviously, you've talked about the macro for a couple of quarters now. When you look across Cloudflare's portfolio, obviously, it's broad, Zero Trust services, network services, application services, developer platform, where have you seen the most impact to the business? And then conversely, what has actually held up the most?  And then a follow-on for Thomas and Michelle. You talked about it being -- keeping your eye on hiring relative to revenue growth. What are the puts and takes that you're seeing there trying to balance, obviously, the long-term $5 billion target also to sort of the near-term realities?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Phil, I'll start, and then hand it off to Thomas and Michelle. So I think that what we have been seeing and I think we've been very transparent about talking about is that the velocity of sales at large companies, and especially in getting new logos, is slowing down. It feels like everyone right now is measuring twice to cut once. And I think we started to see that, as we've talked about on previous calls, in December of last year, and you're seeing some of that slowness in new business now flow through and hit our top line.  What I think is continuing to hold up extremely well right now, and in fact, in some cases, we're seeing acceleration, is in the security portion of our business. While it is worrisome the global conflicts that we are all watching in multiple parts of the world, that is putting more pressure on companies to make sure that their security is in a good place. And so I think that while, as I said last quarter, the economy, the macro economy is challenging right now, and we have said that, I think, consistently for the last 3 calls, we do believe that we are very well positioned, and I continue to say that I wouldn't trade places with any other CEO at any other company.\nPhilip Winslow: Great. And then on in terms of hiring - yes...\nThomas Seifert: So you saw that our employee headcount grew 42% year-over-year in the quarter. I think we've been very restrained when it came to corporate functions and G&A expenses, but we have made sure that we hire core sales capacity in our go-to-market functions in a way that we are not hindering the potential and the opportunity that is in front of us. So we try to be very balanced where we slow down, and we have been very strategic where we added headcount in terms of numbers, but also in terms of footprint from a regional perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg: Matthew, in your prepared remarks, you noted economic headwinds that you've been talking about the last couple of quarters have showed up here. I wonder if you or if Marc is in the room, too, can you talk a little bit about perhaps what your sales force can do to kind of navigate these headwinds? Is it a different sales motion? Is it a different way to engage with the customer? Just sort of curious on how sales organizations adapt to these headwinds.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So first of all, I don't think there's anything that has dramatically changed this quarter and at this time versus what we were seeing earlier in the year. And so I think the adjustments that we made in terms of our go-to-market strategy are actually things that we've made previously and we've seen positive benefits from those changes. The nature of subscription businesses is that if you see slowdowns in the beginning of the year, they show up in your top line later in the year.  But the thing that we did that I think have been successful and will continue to be successful is really focusing on how do we get to know the customers that already know us and trust us. How do we sell more to those customers from the broad portfolio of products that we have, and how do we make sure that they are getting all of the value from Cloudflare. And one of the things that I think we're hearing over and over again is that as companies are thinking about how can they reduce their cloud spend, how can they rationalize it, how can they make sure that they are getting the most out of the IT dollars that they're deploying, over and over and over again, we are able to deliver services that help companies save money, get better performance, get higher reliability, get more variability in a multi-cloud environment and make sure that they are secure.  And so as we look at our customers, they see us more and more as a strategic partner on making sure that they're getting the most out of every IT dollar they spend.\nThomas Seifert: Great. I just want to put an additional comment on it. Just coming back from customer-driven Europe, at the time were Matthew said, the security products are holding up nicely in light of all the security and threat concerns we see out there, leaning heavier on the intelligence we have. We just launched a threat intelligence product, Cloudforce, a couple of weeks ago, leading on this asset we have in terms of the intelligence and the insight we have is helping us, especially with opening up doors of new logos.\nMatthew Hedberg: That's super clear. And then maybe, Matthew, obviously, R2 is early, but it's great to hear the success already with a petabyte of storage. Can you talk about what sort of customers you're seeing leverage these? Are these some of your biggest strategic customers? Are they -- just maybe a little bit of color on where you're seeing that usage.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So in the quarter, the usage was mostly still during our beta period. And so the users of that product have primarily been developers that are using it to build new services or small teams within larger organizations. What I think that we'll see now that it is out of beta as of the very end of the quarter, is that you'll see much more large companies who are looking to figure out how they can reduce their cloud spend and make sure that they can have a multi-cloud presence adopt our R2 services.  And so we are talking to very large companies about moving more and more of their stored objects to where we can store that with R2. And one of the benefits is not only can we help them save money on the egress fees, but it allows them to then use those objects across any of the different cloud platforms they're using. So by being that neutral third-party, we can let people adopt a little bit of Amazon, a little bit of Microsoft, a little bit of Google, a little bit of SaaS vendors and share that data across all of those different places.  It actually is a use case that makes putting data in the network. One of the things which is really valuable, and I think you'll -- in quarters to come, the larger and larger companies adopt that as the object store for their company.\nOperator: Next up is Brent Thill, Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Matthew, one of the key themes we keep hearing is the theme of consolidation that you're used in a lot of pockets of organizations, and many are saying that they could consolidate. Do you feel, over the next year, you can use that to your advantage? Is there a sales motion or an opportunity you're starting to see where you're getting wider enterprise license agreements to take on more and more solutions?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Brent. I think that we are extremely well positioned to help companies fare it out any type of savings that they can find across their organization. And the conversations that we're having are very much around how can companies consolidate their vendors into what are those critical vendors that provide services and how can they really save money in the process of doing that.  The fact that we've got a broad portfolio of products as we do means that what we're seeing is more and more companies are adopting the complete Cloudflare network. And I think the way that, that shows up in the numbers is the fact that our customers that are over $500,000 a year of spend, over $1 million a year of spend are growing faster than our overall revenue growth rate and our overall customer growth rate. And so I think that's a good indication that the customers are doubling down and using more of our services, I think that's going to make it a more challenging environment for those point cloud solutions that are out there. And that we will increasingly take share and help be that strategic vendor to become the network for our customers.\nBrent Thill: And can I just quickly clarify with Thomas. With the slowdown that you're seeing, did you see that more pronounced in small and mid versus large? Or do you see it against SMID and large.\nThomas Seifert: I see, you see in each one of the segments you mentioned, you see some impact. We talked about pay-as-you-go down trading to free, saying our customer stay on the platform by downgrading. We see elongated sales cycles at the very high end in the very large customer cohorts. And we see the expansion in the mid-market segment slowed down a bit. Churn? They didn't churn off, but the expansion was a bit harder. So it really depends on what segment you look at.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from James Fish, Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Matthew, you highlighted that Fortune 500 retail win with Cloudflare kind of that glue between the hyperscalers. And you also said you see Fortune 500 penetration getting to 100% over time. I guess, how are you balancing that strategy of being that glue or fabric between the hyperscalers versus being that full infrastructure-as-a-service offering alternative to the hyperscalers? And how does that success of one or the other change your view or ability to hit that $5 billion goal 5 years out?\nMatthew Prince: I think that our approach is very different than the hyperscalers. The hyperscalers sort of start from the inside and work their way out, and we are starting from the outside and working our way in. And what I mean by that is, fundamentally, what Cloudflare is, is a network. And we want to be the best network to connect anything online, to connect cloud-to-cloud, cloud to home office, cloud to remote office, cloud to branch office. Anything that is having to be connected by a network, we want to be that network.  There are things that make a ton of sense to live in the network itself. So for instance, a shared object that you're going to use across Google and Microsoft and AWS. So on that with R2 makes a ton of sense because we're not going to charge you the egress tax to be able to access that across all of those different platforms. You're also going to, for some applications, want to make some parts of the application as fast and as scalable and as reliable as possible.  And so those parts can live inside of CloudFlare. But our strategy is not to completely recreate every single thing that the hyperscalers do. We want to be the best network that is there, and there will be places at the margins where we absolutely will compete with them. And again, I think increasingly, we're seeing that companies are able to build entire applications using the Cloudflare stack in a way which is much more modern and much more reliable. But we'll never going to be the place that you can lift and shift SAP [indiscernible]. That's just not the what we're building. Instead, what we're building is for those applications that need to live inside the network for either the performance, reliability, compliance requirements and the data that live inside the network for those same reasons. We want to be the network to be able to do that.  I think regardless, we see with the products that we have in market today a clear path to getting to $5 billion of revenue. And that doesn't assume any M&A. We believe that, that is through organic -- organically that we can get to $5 billion of revenue in the next 5 years with the products that are in market today. And so I think that we don't have to -- the hyperscalers don't have to fail for us to succeed. We actually see ourselves as much more of that glue between them. And whether companies want to be multi-cloud or not, they all are. And so that glue is critically important. And again, I think we provide the only solution as we see companies that are trying to struggle with reconciling that increasingly multi-cloud world.\nJames Fish: And Thomas, maybe for you. Is there any way to understand the impact or adoption of that monthly to annual conversion with enterprise specifically this quarter? Are customers actually looking for staying with shorter duration, just given this macro uncertainty? Or are they alternatively looking to lock-in for longer on the infrastructure side?\nThomas Seifert: Good question. As we said in the past, the moving from monthly billing and contracts to annual is our biggest lever on our path to delivering free cash flow. In a world, especially outside of North America where exchange rates are high, customers are more resistant to lock in. And as you know, we don't want to discount too much in order to lock in lower revenue in a world of difficult exchange rates. So we have been more confident, I think, to customers and partners in general in this environment and have not pushed as hard moving forward in this transition.  But it is still the biggest lever we have, and it's an opportunity that is in front of us, and it will materialize in our free cash flow numbers moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shaul Eyal, Cowen.\nShaul Eyal: Matthew, on Area 1, when you've acquired them, I think you've indicated they can assist you in taking you guys deeper into the cloud community. How is that coming along thus far? And maybe any commentary about win rates versus Zscaler, maybe even Palo Alto, that you flagged in recent quarters.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, sure. So Area 1 team is amazing. And I think they brought to us 3 distinct things. The first is a product, which I think is a natural gateway to our overall Zero Trust solutions. The second is a world-class threat intelligence team, which we are now turning into a product both to sell to our existing customers and also as a great way to attract new customers and create some of the marketing around the threat intelligence that we do.  And then the third is a really much deeper and more mature understanding of channel through some of their leadership that we have -- that we've brought on board. And again, I think that has matured, helped us mature what our channel strategy has been.  I think looking at Area 1 in particular, we're seeing particular strength in Asia, actually around the Area 1 product. And I think our sales team, especially in Japan, has done a great job selling the Area 1 product. We're seeing a lot of it. And that's the straight e-mail security product. And once we have got someone using the e-mail security product, it's a very natural extension for them to turn to the rest of our Zero Trust product.  I think in addition, the threat intelligence team has helped us win larger and larger customers and being able to help customers understand if something goes bump in the middle of the night, what's going on has been somebody that is the Area 1 team, again, has really helped us with.  And then again, the channel -- our channel strategy, you're seeing more and more of our deals, especially in the Zero Trust space, come through our channel. Our win rates against Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks continue to be very strong. our product in that space competes extremely well with them. That is the challenge and the thing that I think we are continuing to work on is just increased awareness in the market. And that's something where, as we were thinking about who is the right replacement for Chris, Marc's background in identity and access management both at Oracle and at Twilio, he really understands that market, and I think is going to help us increase the awareness that's there.  But when a customer is considering going on their Zero Trust journey, if we're in that consideration, we love our win rates in that. And so our job is now just to increase our awareness and go from the company that people might have known us for doing 1 thing is today a much more sophisticated, much more broad portfolio. And I'm excited as that goes. And I think that Zero Trust is very much going to be the story of the next few years to come.\nOperator: We will take the next question from Hamza Fodderwala, Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Matthew, and perhaps Thomas as well, I wanted to dig in a little bit around the net expansion point. And you spoke a little bit about this already. But just to get more specific, we're hearing from a lot of cloud service providers around rationalization. Matthew, you spoke a little bit about how the costs there are getting too high.  But as it relates to Cloudflare, are you seeing any of that rationalization as it relates to your usage and expansion? And obviously, you have a very different pricing model as a subscription-based company, and this is kind of where Thomas comes in. How do you expect that to play out mechanically over the next few quarters as we likely see these expansion rates continue to be impacted?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, I think that if you are a usage-based, a purely usage-based model, it is a place where people are looking for areas to save money. Similarly, if you are a seat-based model, as you're seeing some companies do layoffs or, at a minimum, not expand their seats, that is something that is challenging in the current environment. I think we are fortunate that today, most of our revenue is not usage-based and not seat-based. And so while we are adding products that are in both of those categories, and we think that over time that, that will be an expansion driver for us, that today, we're not seeing that downward pressure from people trying to rationalize or consolidate their bills.  I think the 1 place which Thomas referenced, where we are seeing some pressure is actually with new accounts because we bill all in U.S. dollars. That is putting some pressure, especially outside of the United States, and we are making concessions in order to accommodate what are the foreign exchange pressures that are there. Again, though, it's less about our existing customers trying to figure out how to use less of us. In fact, if anything, we're seeing that they are trying to say, how can we use more of you instead of using what are some of the other consumption-based alternatives which are out there. So I think we have been less exposed to that downward pressure than some of the pure consumption-based services that exist.\nThomas Seifert: That was a very complete answer. I have nothing to add.\nOperator: Next up is Sterling Auty, MoffetNathanson.\nUnidentified Analyst: So Matthew, in terms of thinking about the threshold of keeping the margins basically flat within that context of growing to $5 billion, is there kind of like a threshold growth rate that you think about? So as long as you're over 30%or 35% or 40%, you'll keep it there, otherwise, you would reconsider kind of the margin profile?\nMatthew Prince: I don't know that we have a specific guidance. I've always personally, and Thomas will probably slap me for saying this, but I've always personally kind of found the sort of idea of the Rule of 40 to be pretty compelling. And so I think that we like that. And I think that, that would -- if we're growing north of 40%, then I think that, that's showing that we can continue to execute and deliver on the enormous opportunity that we have ahead.  And so again, I think we're -- we want -- we know that we have the levers to when it's the right time for us to be a business that delivers very significant operating profits. But while we see a total addressable market ahead of us that we only have less than 1% penetration on, we think that it makes sense to continue to invest in that market and continue to drive growth going forward. And today, we're still living above the Rule of 50. So I think we've got some time to think about that.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from John DiFucci, Guggenheim.\nUnidentified Analyst: I have a question for Matthew and then a quick follow-up for Thomas. Matthew, I just want to make sure I understand your comments about acceleration in the security portion of your business. Security businesses have so far anyway generally held up well against the macro slowness. It sounds like that's continuing or even getting stronger for you given your comment there. But I wanted to make sure in that the macro backdrop is really manifesting itself more broadly in the rest of your business. Is that correct?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So first of all, I don't -- I think we have been consistent in talking about the macro pressures now for the last 3 quarters. And there isn't something that has dramatically changed since we started to warn that there were pressures in the macro space.  What I think, if we dig down a little further into the security business, I think especially in February of this year, when we saw Russia and then Ukraine, a lot of security companies expect that, that would be a tailwind to their business. What I think actually ended up happening was that, that tailwind did not materialize, and that the threat that the Russians are coming turned out to not be something which was showed up outside of the Ukrainian theater.  However, in the last several months, and especially in Q3, we started to see an increase in cyberattacks coming out of both Russia and other parts of the world. That drives increasing adoption of products like Cloudflare's products at a very, very, very high velocity. So where we'll see close rates that you can often measure in hours or days.  And so I think that, that expectation of the war in Ukraine and other political conflicts around the rest of the world leading to more security business was something that I think a lot of the industry expected would show up in Q1 and Q2, and we actually saw it show up more in Q3.  But generally, the overall macro environment hasn't changed substantially throughout this entire year based on what we're seeing. And so I want to make it clear that we're not saying that we're seeing a big change. We have seen that there was softness in the macro economy since Q1, and we've been talking about it since Q1.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. And you've been very clear on that, Matthew. Thomas, just a quick sort of a follow-up to what Matthew was just talking about. You talked about when you gave the outlook and you talked about your caution in that outlook. I just want to make sure I understand what's implied in that outlook. Are you looking at sort of similar effects due to the macro backdrop? Or are you expecting further deterioration?\nThomas Seifert: We are talking about a subscription-based model. So a lot of the things we see in the third quarter and we'll see in the fourth quarter are the impact of when we started to talk about the macro climate going to change. So when we -- when you give guidance for the fourth quarter, it's less the in-quarter impact of the business. It's just a flow-through of what already has happened.\nUnidentified Analyst: I understand that. But do you -- are you -- do you expect to see the macro backdrop, the effects on your business show further deterioration even if we can't see it, although we kind of think we try to anyway? Or do you expect it to sort of stay about where it is in the softness you've seen over the last couple of quarters, I guess?\nThomas Seifert: We, of course, for sure not assumed an improving of the macroeconomic environment. And with an outlook in Q4 and Q1, there's nothing that signals that it's going to get better anytime soon.\nOperator: Next up, we'll take a question from Andrew Nowinski, Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: I just want to start with a quick sort of follow-up to John's question. I was wondering if you could just provide any color around maybe your pipeline of renewals for Q4 because I assume Q3 pretty big in terms of renewals. I'm wondering if you perhaps changed how you're handicapping the likelihood of those renewals closing in Q4 given the lengthening sales cycles you're seeing? And then I have a follow-up.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I don't think -- again, we have not seen an uptick in overall churn across the business. That has continued to hold very, very strong. And so we haven't changed how we've handicapped the renewal forecast.\nThomas Seifert: And keep in mind, most of our revenue still gets built monthly and not annually. So we don't have this massive renewal quarter in the fourth quarter, at least not yet.\nAndrew Nowinski: Got it. Okay. I just want to also just dive a little deeper on the security and how security demand is holding up. We heard, obviously, over the last few days, Fortinet talking about how they're seeing sort of more normal spending patterns from customers where they're not ordering -- placing orders for firewalls 12 months in advance because the supply is starting to free up. I suppose you could view that negatively as sort of a change in the overall security spending environment. But could you also view it as a positive for Cloudflare because now customers aren't making sort of irrational purchase decisions in buying firewalls, whereas now they can actually evaluate and deploy a smarter solution like Cloudflare One? Just wondering kind of how you view that change that the firewall vendors are talking about.\nMatthew Prince: I mean, I think that there's -- I think that you've had a series of head stakes from the hardware space for quite some time going back to the Trump tax cuts that moved forward a lot of incentives on CapEx spending, the beginning of COVID where everyone was just scrambling to keep the lights on and then the supply chain crisis, which again made people place orders just to get in line for products that they may not eventually even want to have.  So it is in the grand course of history, you can't solve the problems of a distributed workforce, you can't solve the problems in the cloud by shipping a box or a virtual box. It just doesn't work. And so I think that anything that gets the market back to being rational without any kind of sort of artificial incentives to continue to invest in hardware is definitely beneficial for Cloudflare and other cloud-based security solutions.\nOperator: Up next is Fatima Boolani, Citi.\nFatima Boolani: Matthew, one for you, and then Thomas, 1 for you as well. Matthew, wanted to ask you about your pricing strategy, pricing philosophy question. So we heard a lot in your prepared commentary about the downshifting of customers or trade down from customers to some of your free solutions, which, of course, have better TCO in this environment. I'm wondering what's the rationale for you to maybe not, I guess, raise the floor on that so you can hold on to the paying customers? I'm just curious about how you're sort of thinking about that. And then I have a follow-up for Thomas, please.\nMatthew Prince: So first of all, our pay-as-you-go business is a relatively small portion of our business. It's much less than 20% of revenue. And so I think that what we see as the value from that pay-as-you-go business is that those customers, whether they pay us something or not, end up being our biggest advocates and our biggest champions inside whatever large organization that they operate at.  So if you look at who are our largest customers and you go down the top 10 customers, almost all of them came to us originally because some technical leader inside that organization used Cloudflare's pay-as-you-go services, fell in love with us, understood us and was able to adopt us as part of that. And so I think that, that benefit is so substantial to us that we always want to make sure that we're treating those customers well.  And so as Thomas said, well, they may go from paying us $20 a month to not paying us something because gas prices went up, that isn't something that we're trying to optimize for. What we're trying to optimize for is that those customers love us, they understand us and they take us to work. And so as they do, that's how we've been able to close so much of the Fortune 500. Behind almost every 1 of those Fortune 500 wins is a pay-as-you-go customer who advocated for us internally, and that is our secret sales force.\nFatima Boolani: Fair enough. Appreciate you sticking to your ethos on that. Thomas, on the dollar net expansion rate discussion, I appreciate you kind of shared some of the granularity as to where some of the pressures are coming from there. But I'm curious from a product pillar perspective, if you can shed light on, are you seeing expansion levels moderate within the application services bucket or the network services bucket? Just kind of curious to get a sense of what future functionalities across your portfolio are more prone to that expansion velocity dynamic?\nThomas Seifert: I think the first statement to make is, for us, this is -- it's a very true number. It's an all-in number, covering our pay-as-you-go business, our mid-market and our enterprise. And as we just discussed over the last 50 minutes, different segments behave differently. We just spent talked about pay-as-you-go customers churning off and becoming free customers, that is something that hinders across the cohort expansion. We have seen exchange rate headwinds from a billing and contracting perspective in overseas accounts. So that is something that would be reflected in an expansion number.  And then we talked about prolongated sales cycles at the very high end in the very large cohorts. And that is if you go back to the KPIs we shared where a lot of growth dynamics are happening, those cohorts are growing, in general, significantly faster than our average growth rate. So any movement we have in terms of sales cycles in the very large cohorts is impacting DNR in the current quarter. But this does not take away from the opportunity that it is in front of us, and it falls into the logic that we always had when we talked about DNR. We really see a path forward to get north of 130%, but there will be movement around that number. It will not be a straight line that gets us there.\nJayson Noland: Operator, can we take a question from one last analyst, please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Our final question will come from James Breen, William Blair.\nJames Breen: Can you just talk a little bit about the M&A environment? I know you talked about getting to $5 billion organically, it seems with valuations coming down and given the cash you have, are there going to be opportunities out there to maybe add products or some scale in certain divisions around other companies?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Jim. I think our -- different companies are built in different ways. And so if you look at Cisco, they were very much an M&A and acquisition machine, whereas if you look at an Apple, they do M&A, but it's usually for core technologies. It's not for products. I think we are much more like an Apple than we are like a Cisco. We have watched as some of the competitors in the space have really tie themselves up in not building what is effectively a Frankenstein-type solution through a series of M&A, and they don't get the same level of efficiency that we do.  And so I think that we will always be biased against M&A, and we will always have a very high hurdle rate to do any sort of a transaction, which isn't to say we won't do transactions. When we find great technologies, great teams, great ways to integrate like we did with Area 1, we will jump on that. And as the valuations and multiples, especially in some of the private markets, continue to fall, we look at lots and lots of deals. But I don't think that, that has changed that relative to other companies, I think we're going to maintain a very high hurdle rate. We have very much optimized around internal development.  And as Marc said in his responses, we believe we can get to $5 billion without having to build or buy any new products or companies that are out there. We think we've got the right products in the bag today. It's just a matter of us continuing to execute on the go-to-market side.\nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand things back to Mr. Matthew Prince for any additional or closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: Just wanted to thank everyone on Cloudflare's team for delivering what has been, again, another strong quarter. We're proud of the fact that we're protecting the U.S. elections, and we're standing by to make sure that they go off smoothly.  I also want to specifically thank Chris for his nearly 10 years of service at Cloudflare, and appreciate all that he's doing to transition and get Marc on board. And to wish Jayson, good luck in his new role as CFO, assigning all of those SEC statements, hopefully, won't keep him up too much at night. And I know that he's going to do an amazing job going forward.  Thank you all for being investors. Look forward to talking again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude this conference. Thank you all for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. As Matthew mentioned, we achieved an important milestone in the third quarter, surpassing $1 billion revenue run rate for the first time. This milestone is a testament to our enormous market opportunity, our ability to land and expand large enterprise customers and the durability of our subscription-based revenue model.  Turning to revenue for the quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 47% year-over-year to $253.9 million. Area 1, the e-mail security company we acquired in April, again contributed less than 1% of revenue this quarter.  While we are seeing foreign exchange headwinds and global economic uncertainty impact the business, we continue that traction upmarket and believe we are very well positioned in this environment.  From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 53% of revenue, and increased 49% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue, and increased 51% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue, and increased 38% year-over-year. The APAC performance has improved meaningfully from last year, but we are seeing more price sensitivity and buying decision delays in the APAC region.  Turning to our customer metrics. In the third quarter, we had 156,000 paying customers, representing an increase of 18% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we saw a higher level of churn in our pay-as-you-go customer base, primarily due to more customers shifting down to our free customer tier. We think this is a function of a more challenging macro environment. However, we are pleased to see these customers to remain on our platform.  Turning to large customers. We ended the quarter with 1,908 large customers, representing an increase of 51% year-over-year and an addition of 159 large customers in the quarter. We were pleased to see large customer revenue contribution increase again sequentially.  We are also encouraged to see the quality of wins continue to increase across the Fortune 500 in a broad array of verticals, including consumer, retail, health care, life science, pharmaceutical, industrial, telco and financial services. While sales cycles at the high end of the business have elongated, we continue to see our $500,000-plus and $1 million plus cohort scoring faster than top line revenue. We also achieved a milestone of 75 customers larger than $1 million in the third quarter.  Our dollar-based net retention was 124%, representing a decrease of 200 basis points sequentially and consistent year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by less net expansion we have not seen elevated churn.  As we mentioned previously, while we expect DNR to continue to trend upward over time, we expect some variability quarter-to-quarter. We continue to target 130%-plus dollar-based net retention rate given our momentum with large enterprise customers and the net expansion characteristics of seed-based solutions.  Moving to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin was 78.1%, representing a decrease of 80 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 13% of revenue in the third quarter. We expect fiscal 2022 network CapEx to come in at the lower end of the 12% to 14% range due to the timing of purchases and inherent efficiencies in the network.  Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 7% sequentially and 6% year-over-year to 72%. Our total number of employees increased 42% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to approximately 3,180 at the end of the quarter. We will continue to invest in the business. So as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to pace hiring based on current market conditions.  Sales and marketing expenses were $103.5 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 3% sequentially, and decreased to 41% from 45% in the same quarter last year.  Research and development expenses were $46.4 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and decreased to 18% from 19% in the same quarter last year.  General and administrative expenses were $33.6 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2% sequentially, and decreased to 13% from 14% in the same quarter last year.  Operating income was $14.8 million compared to an operating income of $2.2 million in the same period last year. Third quarter operating margin was 5.8%, an increase of 450 basis points year-over-year. Overseas operating expenses benefited from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which contributed to the increase in operating profit.  Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $19.1 million or net income per share of $0.06. Tax expenses for the quarter was $1.7 million. We ended the third quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $4.6 million in the third quarter or 2% of revenue, compared to negative $39.7 million or 23% of revenue in the same period last year.  Operating cash flow was $42.7 million in the third quarter or 17% of revenue, compared to $6.9 million or 4% of revenue in the same period last year. As stated previously, we continue to expect to be free cash flow positive in the second half of 2022.  Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $831 million, representing an increase of 9% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. Before moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year, I would like to reiterate our expectations in light of the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. While we saw a foreign exchange benefit to operating expenses, we also saw FX headwinds to revenue as we offer concessions to offset the strength of the U.S. dollar internationally.  In the quarter, we observed an increase in our sales cycle and expect similar sales dynamics to continue, leading to longer lead time deal closures. We are cognizant of the increasingly cautious environment and have factored this into our outlook.  Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $273.5 million to $274.5 million, representing an increase of 41% to 42% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $12 million to $13 million, and we expect net income per share of $0.04 to $0.05, assuming approximately 343 million common shares outstanding. And we expect a tax expense of $1.9 million.  For the full year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $974 million to $975 million, representing an increase of 48% to 49% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $31 million to $32 million, and we expect net income per share over that period in the range of $0.11 to $0.12, assuming approximately 342 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $6.1 million. Although challenges remain in the current environment, we are confident in the continued growth of our business and the durability of our subscription model.  Before closing, I would like to let you know that Jayson Nolan, our Head of Strategic Finance and Investor Relations, is leaving us. This is happy and sad news. Happy for him to pursue his first CFO opportunity at a pre-IPO software company, but sad to lose such an integral member of the team. I want to thank him personally for his leadership and partnership, and wish him great success in his next chapter.  In closing, I'd like to thank Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication in delivering exceptional service to our customers, partners and communities. And as Matthew mentioned, now that we have reached a $1 billion revenue run rate, we are setting our sights on the next milestones of $5 billion in 5 years.  With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. So you saw that our employee headcount grew 42% year-over-year in the quarter. I think we've been very restrained when it came to corporate functions and G&A expenses, but we have made sure that we hire core sales capacity in our go-to-market functions in a way that we are not hindering the potential and the opportunity that is in front of us. So we try to be very balanced where we slow down, and we have been very strategic where we added headcount in terms of numbers, but also in terms of footprint from a regional perspective. Great. I just want to put an additional comment on it. Just coming back from customer-driven Europe, at the time were Matthew said, the security products are holding up nicely in light of all the security and threat concerns we see out there, leaning heavier on the intelligence we have. We just launched a threat intelligence product, Cloudforce, a couple of weeks ago, leading on this asset we have in terms of the intelligence and the insight we have is helping us, especially with opening up doors of new logos. I see, you see in each one of the segments you mentioned, you see some impact. We talked about pay-as-you-go down trading to free, saying our customer stay on the platform by downgrading. We see elongated sales cycles at the very high end in the very large customer cohorts. And we see the expansion in the mid-market segment slowed down a bit. Churn? They didn't churn off, but the expansion was a bit harder. So it really depends on what segment you look at. Good question. As we said in the past, the moving from monthly billing and contracts to annual is our biggest lever on our path to delivering free cash flow. In a world, especially outside of North America where exchange rates are high, customers are more resistant to lock in. And as you know, we don't want to discount too much in order to lock in lower revenue in a world of difficult exchange rates. So we have been more confident, I think, to customers and partners in general in this environment and have not pushed as hard moving forward in this transition.  But it is still the biggest lever we have, and it's an opportunity that is in front of us, and it will materialize in our free cash flow numbers moving forward. That was a very complete answer. I have nothing to add. We are talking about a subscription-based model. So a lot of the things we see in the third quarter and we'll see in the fourth quarter are the impact of when we started to talk about the macro climate going to change. So when we -- when you give guidance for the fourth quarter, it's less the in-quarter impact of the business. It's just a flow-through of what already has happened. We, of course, for sure not assumed an improving of the macroeconomic environment. And with an outlook in Q4 and Q1, there's nothing that signals that it's going to get better anytime soon. And keep in mind, most of our revenue still gets built monthly and not annually. So we don't have this massive renewal quarter in the fourth quarter, at least not yet. I think the first statement to make is, for us, this is -- it's a very true number. It's an all-in number, covering our pay-as-you-go business, our mid-market and our enterprise. And as we just discussed over the last 50 minutes, different segments behave differently. We just spent talked about pay-as-you-go customers churning off and becoming free customers, that is something that hinders across the cohort expansion. We have seen exchange rate headwinds from a billing and contracting perspective in overseas accounts. So that is something that would be reflected in an expansion number.  And then we talked about prolongated sales cycles at the very high end in the very large cohorts. And that is if you go back to the KPIs we shared where a lot of growth dynamics are happening, those cohorts are growing, in general, significantly faster than our average growth rate. So any movement we have in terms of sales cycles in the very large cohorts is impacting DNR in the current quarter. But this does not take away from the opportunity that it is in front of us, and it falls into the logic that we always had when we talked about DNR. We really see a path forward to get north of 130%, but there will be movement around that number. It will not be a straight line that gets us there."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Jayson. We had a strong quarter, even as the economic environment has continued to be challenging. We generated $254 million in revenue, up 47% year-over-year. Unsurprisingly, the slowdown in the economy we discussed on the last 2 earnings calls is starting to show up on our top line revenue numbers. Even with those economic headwinds, this quarter marked a milestone for us, crossing through $1 billion in annualized revenue. Only 6% of public software companies achieved this milestone, so we're proud to have crossed it, but nowhere close to finished.  We added 4,197 paying customers for a total of 156,000 paying customers. For large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, we added 159 new large customers for a total of 1,908, up 51% year-over-year. Large customers now account for 61% of revenue. And our large customers keep getting larger. The number of customers over $500,000 in annual spend grew 88% year-over-year, and customers over $1 million grew 63% year-over-year.  Even with inflation hitting some of our costs, our gross margin held strong at 78.1%, still above our target gross margin range of 75% to 77%. We achieved a record operating profit of $14.8 million, representing an operating margin of 5.8%. We are confident we can deliver meaningful operating margins over time, but continue to plan to hold them near breakeven as long as we're able to deliver exceptional revenue growth.  Our dollar-based net retention in the quarter was 124%, flat year-over-year and down from 126% last quarter. While there is some noise in that number based on when contracts renew, we will continue to be dissatisfied until it's over 130%, and we believe that it's still very achievable as we add seats and storage-based products like Zero Trust and R2.  We are proud to have crossed through $1 billion in annualized revenue, but it has us thinking about our next milestones. While there are economic challenges for every business in the near-term, we know that the opportunity Cloudflare has ahead of the long-term is massive. Even as we achieve $1 billion, we have penetrated less than 1% of our identified market for products we already have available today.  That's why we're confident. We're on the path to organically achieve $5 billion in annualized revenue over the next 5 years. Less than 1% of all public software companies reach the $5 billion milestone. And while today's global economy will continue to present headwinds in the quarters ahead, as we look further out, we are confident we have the products already in market to get us there.  Crossing the $1 billion milestone is also an opportunity to reflect on our team. It's a natural normal process to have different leaders for different stages in the company's life. Earlier this year, Chris Merritt, who runs our sales team, reached out to me and Michelle to say that, while he wasn't in a hurry, he thought it made sense for someone else to take us to the next milestone past $1 billion.  Chris himself is a unicorn. He started at Cloudflare almost 10 years ago as our first sales hire. We grew our revenue from 0 to $1 billion. I've tried to count the number of sales leaders who have accomplished that, and have come up with fewer than 10 across all the history of software. I wanted to give Chris the floor for a second to recognize him and all he's accomplished and helped us build at Cloudflare. Thanks, Chris. We couldn't have gotten here without you. As Chris said, he worked closely with us over the last several months to identify the right person to lead our sales team going forward. The person we found is terrific. He understands enterprise sales from his time as a senior leader at Oracle, can help accelerate our Zero Trust go-to-market based on his experience in the identity and access management space, cracks the desire to developers as we turn workers into a massive business and recently led sales for Twilio, another Software-as-a-Service company, which grew more than 50% organically compounded during its tenure to a $4 billion annualized run rate.  Marc Boroditsky is uniquely qualified to take us to our next milestone and beyond. I wanted to give him the floor to talk a bit about why he joined Cloudflare. Thanks, Marc. We are excited for you to build on the great team Chris has put in place and further mature our go-to-market efforts as we sell more products to larger and larger customers. With that set up, let me tell you about some customer wins last quarter.  A Fortune 500 technology financial services company signed a 1-year $2.8 million contract. They faced an increasing number of sophisticated cyber attacks. They compared us against nearly all of our competitors. While the competitors tried to offer lower pricing, it didn't matter. This company was so convinced that we were the clear technical leader that they paid a premium for our services. They see the value of our integrated approach, and are now evaluating us to be their Zero Trust provider as well.  A Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare. They signed an additional $915,000 3-year deal, bringing their total contract over that period with us to $7.4 million. They're adopting our data localization suite, powered by Cloudflare Workers. This product allows customers to process data locally in the countries where their customers reside. These features are unique in the industry to Cloudflare and increasingly important to highly regulated customers like this one.  A Fortune 500 European telecom signed a 3-year $1.2 million deal. The customer was moving more of their security services from on-premise hardware to the cloud. While they evaluated our security services as best of breed, the show stopper for them again was our data localization suite. None of the other vendors they considered, including the hyperscale public cloud, had an equivalent solution. We're seeing more and more EU companies adopting Cloudflare in order to meet the increasing data localization and data residency requirements becoming law in the region. A Fortune 500 retailer expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a $442,000 deal and bringing their annual commitment to nearly $1 million. They are using Workers to build highly scalable functions across their e-commerce application. They're also using Cloudflare's network to route traffic between different hyperscale public cloud vendors they use. Seeing multi-cloud is a priority for them, and Cloudflare is the only vendor they see it being able to help them achieve their vision. They have started experiments with R2, our object store, and D1 our first database. While their spend is still modest, we think there's an opportunity, and they've expressed interest in making us one of their strategic vendors going forward.  A Fortune 500 life sciences conglomerate signed a $745,000 3-year deal. They use a range of our products, including Magic Transit, to better protect their on-premise data centers. They're handing traffic directly to our network, completely replacing their ISP. We've signed an MSA with them, and believe there's a significant opportunity to expand across their other 20 subsidiaries.  A Fortune 500 apparel company signed a 3-year $1.1 million deal. They bought our full set of security services, as well as Cloudflare Workers. A fun fact is that my cofounder, Michelle had an opportunity to be this company's CEO's chief of staff out of business school. Instead, she chose to start Cloudflare, and now their customers.  A Fortune 500 consumer product company expanded their relationship with us, signing an additional $292,000 1-year deal. That brings their total spend with us to nearly $1 million per year. They are using our Zero Trust product, and we worked with a large channel partner to win and service them as a customer.  A Fortune 500 financial services company signed a $236,000 1-year deal. We believe this will be another example of how we can land with 1 product, sign a general MSA and then expand over time.  If you've been counting, that's [indiscernible] Fortune 500 companies, and we're actually up to 32% of the Fortune 500 now using us. I see a clear path to nearly every Fortune 500 company using us for something in the next 5 years. And a big part of Marc and the team's job then is to expand those relationships and then get them to use us for everything.  We aim to be the network for every Fortune 500 company. But not just the Fortune 500. In Q3, a large building materials manufacturer in Europe signed a $1.2 million 31-month expansion deal. They have broadly adopted our Zero Trust products across their 25,000 employees. They have been hit by a ransomware attack earlier this year that their existing e-mail security vendor failed to catch. We included our Area 1 e-mail security product as part of their Zero Trust solution, something no other Zero Trust vendor provides as a native integration.  During our POC, we cut phishing messages that our other existing vendors miss. They went from POC to live in 2 days, and signed a deal a week later. They've been a small customer previously, but turned to us for an integrated solution the minute they had another network security need. And we delivered.  Finally, a large software monitoring company signed a $3.6 million expansion deal, bringing their annual spend to more than $5 million. They're a big user of Cloudflare Workers, processing 7 trillion requests just in September. They are migrating more and more of their applications from AWS to Cloudflare Workers for our performance and easy scalability.  In a few weeks, we have our upcoming Developer Innovation Week, where we'll be announcing some incredible new Cloudflare Workers milestone, but I couldn't resist sharing a few here now.  As of the end of Q3, we're up to 2.2 million unique applications running on Cloudflare Workers. Cloudflare Pages, which is a product within the Cloudflare Workers portfolio, is up to 367,000 projects and has doubled since May.  In September, we announced that R2 is now generally available, along with our other generally available storage products, Workers KV and Worker [indiscernible]. We are now scoring over a petabyte of customer data. And before the end of the quarter, D1, our first database product, will be available in open beta.  Increasingly, we're hearing about more and more start-up companies that are skipping the hyperscale public cloud and building exclusively on Workers. Reflecting that trend in September, we announced the Workers LaunchPad Funding program, in which 26 of the top venture capitalists collectively earmarked up to $1.25 billion in funding for innovative new start-ups building on Cloudflare Workers. The funding program came about because DCs kept coming to us to do due diligence on companies they were considering investing in when more and more of their tech stacks were powered exclusively by Cloudflare Workers.  So from the Fortune 500 to the hottest new startups, increasingly, the future seems powered by Cloudflare Workers. I wanted to close by reminding everyone in the United States that we have an election next Tuesday. That makes this a time of heightened cybersecurity concerns for the country. Through Cloudflare's Athenian project, we provide our services for free to any state and local officials who help oversee election. Today, election authorities in more than half of U.S. states and most of the so-called ballot graph states are participants in the Athenian project. We are proud that we help cyberattacks not be part of the story in the 2020 election, and we have had our team standing by, and they'll be available 24/7 over the next week to help ensure cyberattacks won't be part of the story for 2022 either.  So we'll do the thing we're best at, you don't forget to vote. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. Yes, Phil, I'll start, and then hand it off to Thomas and Michelle. So I think that what we have been seeing and I think we've been very transparent about talking about is that the velocity of sales at large companies, and especially in getting new logos, is slowing down. It feels like everyone right now is measuring twice to cut once. And I think we started to see that, as we've talked about on previous calls, in December of last year, and you're seeing some of that slowness in new business now flow through and hit our top line.  What I think is continuing to hold up extremely well right now, and in fact, in some cases, we're seeing acceleration, is in the security portion of our business. While it is worrisome the global conflicts that we are all watching in multiple parts of the world, that is putting more pressure on companies to make sure that their security is in a good place. And so I think that while, as I said last quarter, the economy, the macro economy is challenging right now, and we have said that, I think, consistently for the last 3 calls, we do believe that we are very well positioned, and I continue to say that I wouldn't trade places with any other CEO at any other company. Yes. So first of all, I don't think there's anything that has dramatically changed this quarter and at this time versus what we were seeing earlier in the year. And so I think the adjustments that we made in terms of our go-to-market strategy are actually things that we've made previously and we've seen positive benefits from those changes. The nature of subscription businesses is that if you see slowdowns in the beginning of the year, they show up in your top line later in the year.  But the thing that we did that I think have been successful and will continue to be successful is really focusing on how do we get to know the customers that already know us and trust us. How do we sell more to those customers from the broad portfolio of products that we have, and how do we make sure that they are getting all of the value from Cloudflare. And one of the things that I think we're hearing over and over again is that as companies are thinking about how can they reduce their cloud spend, how can they rationalize it, how can they make sure that they are getting the most out of the IT dollars that they're deploying, over and over and over again, we are able to deliver services that help companies save money, get better performance, get higher reliability, get more variability in a multi-cloud environment and make sure that they are secure.  And so as we look at our customers, they see us more and more as a strategic partner on making sure that they're getting the most out of every IT dollar they spend. Yes. So in the quarter, the usage was mostly still during our beta period. And so the users of that product have primarily been developers that are using it to build new services or small teams within larger organizations. What I think that we'll see now that it is out of beta as of the very end of the quarter, is that you'll see much more large companies who are looking to figure out how they can reduce their cloud spend and make sure that they can have a multi-cloud presence adopt our R2 services.  And so we are talking to very large companies about moving more and more of their stored objects to where we can store that with R2. And one of the benefits is not only can we help them save money on the egress fees, but it allows them to then use those objects across any of the different cloud platforms they're using. So by being that neutral third-party, we can let people adopt a little bit of Amazon, a little bit of Microsoft, a little bit of Google, a little bit of SaaS vendors and share that data across all of those different places.  It actually is a use case that makes putting data in the network. One of the things which is really valuable, and I think you'll -- in quarters to come, the larger and larger companies adopt that as the object store for their company. Yes, Brent. I think that we are extremely well positioned to help companies fare it out any type of savings that they can find across their organization. And the conversations that we're having are very much around how can companies consolidate their vendors into what are those critical vendors that provide services and how can they really save money in the process of doing that.  The fact that we've got a broad portfolio of products as we do means that what we're seeing is more and more companies are adopting the complete Cloudflare network. And I think the way that, that shows up in the numbers is the fact that our customers that are over $500,000 a year of spend, over $1 million a year of spend are growing faster than our overall revenue growth rate and our overall customer growth rate. And so I think that's a good indication that the customers are doubling down and using more of our services, I think that's going to make it a more challenging environment for those point cloud solutions that are out there. And that we will increasingly take share and help be that strategic vendor to become the network for our customers. I think that our approach is very different than the hyperscalers. The hyperscalers sort of start from the inside and work their way out, and we are starting from the outside and working our way in. And what I mean by that is, fundamentally, what Cloudflare is, is a network. And we want to be the best network to connect anything online, to connect cloud-to-cloud, cloud to home office, cloud to remote office, cloud to branch office. Anything that is having to be connected by a network, we want to be that network.  There are things that make a ton of sense to live in the network itself. So for instance, a shared object that you're going to use across Google and Microsoft and AWS. So on that with R2 makes a ton of sense because we're not going to charge you the egress tax to be able to access that across all of those different platforms. You're also going to, for some applications, want to make some parts of the application as fast and as scalable and as reliable as possible.  And so those parts can live inside of CloudFlare. But our strategy is not to completely recreate every single thing that the hyperscalers do. We want to be the best network that is there, and there will be places at the margins where we absolutely will compete with them. And again, I think increasingly, we're seeing that companies are able to build entire applications using the Cloudflare stack in a way which is much more modern and much more reliable. But we'll never going to be the place that you can lift and shift SAP [indiscernible]. That's just not the what we're building. Instead, what we're building is for those applications that need to live inside the network for either the performance, reliability, compliance requirements and the data that live inside the network for those same reasons. We want to be the network to be able to do that.  I think regardless, we see with the products that we have in market today a clear path to getting to $5 billion of revenue. And that doesn't assume any M&A. We believe that, that is through organic -- organically that we can get to $5 billion of revenue in the next 5 years with the products that are in market today. And so I think that we don't have to -- the hyperscalers don't have to fail for us to succeed. We actually see ourselves as much more of that glue between them. And whether companies want to be multi-cloud or not, they all are. And so that glue is critically important. And again, I think we provide the only solution as we see companies that are trying to struggle with reconciling that increasingly multi-cloud world. Yes, sure. So Area 1 team is amazing. And I think they brought to us 3 distinct things. The first is a product, which I think is a natural gateway to our overall Zero Trust solutions. The second is a world-class threat intelligence team, which we are now turning into a product both to sell to our existing customers and also as a great way to attract new customers and create some of the marketing around the threat intelligence that we do.  And then the third is a really much deeper and more mature understanding of channel through some of their leadership that we have -- that we've brought on board. And again, I think that has matured, helped us mature what our channel strategy has been.  I think looking at Area 1 in particular, we're seeing particular strength in Asia, actually around the Area 1 product. And I think our sales team, especially in Japan, has done a great job selling the Area 1 product. We're seeing a lot of it. And that's the straight e-mail security product. And once we have got someone using the e-mail security product, it's a very natural extension for them to turn to the rest of our Zero Trust product.  I think in addition, the threat intelligence team has helped us win larger and larger customers and being able to help customers understand if something goes bump in the middle of the night, what's going on has been somebody that is the Area 1 team, again, has really helped us with.  And then again, the channel -- our channel strategy, you're seeing more and more of our deals, especially in the Zero Trust space, come through our channel. Our win rates against Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks continue to be very strong. our product in that space competes extremely well with them. That is the challenge and the thing that I think we are continuing to work on is just increased awareness in the market. And that's something where, as we were thinking about who is the right replacement for Chris, Marc's background in identity and access management both at Oracle and at Twilio, he really understands that market, and I think is going to help us increase the awareness that's there.  But when a customer is considering going on their Zero Trust journey, if we're in that consideration, we love our win rates in that. And so our job is now just to increase our awareness and go from the company that people might have known us for doing 1 thing is today a much more sophisticated, much more broad portfolio. And I'm excited as that goes. And I think that Zero Trust is very much going to be the story of the next few years to come. Yes, I think that if you are a usage-based, a purely usage-based model, it is a place where people are looking for areas to save money. Similarly, if you are a seat-based model, as you're seeing some companies do layoffs or, at a minimum, not expand their seats, that is something that is challenging in the current environment. I think we are fortunate that today, most of our revenue is not usage-based and not seat-based. And so while we are adding products that are in both of those categories, and we think that over time that, that will be an expansion driver for us, that today, we're not seeing that downward pressure from people trying to rationalize or consolidate their bills.  I think the 1 place which Thomas referenced, where we are seeing some pressure is actually with new accounts because we bill all in U.S. dollars. That is putting some pressure, especially outside of the United States, and we are making concessions in order to accommodate what are the foreign exchange pressures that are there. Again, though, it's less about our existing customers trying to figure out how to use less of us. In fact, if anything, we're seeing that they are trying to say, how can we use more of you instead of using what are some of the other consumption-based alternatives which are out there. So I think we have been less exposed to that downward pressure than some of the pure consumption-based services that exist. I don't know that we have a specific guidance. I've always personally, and Thomas will probably slap me for saying this, but I've always personally kind of found the sort of idea of the Rule of 40 to be pretty compelling. And so I think that we like that. And I think that, that would -- if we're growing north of 40%, then I think that, that's showing that we can continue to execute and deliver on the enormous opportunity that we have ahead.  And so again, I think we're -- we want -- we know that we have the levers to when it's the right time for us to be a business that delivers very significant operating profits. But while we see a total addressable market ahead of us that we only have less than 1% penetration on, we think that it makes sense to continue to invest in that market and continue to drive growth going forward. And today, we're still living above the Rule of 50. So I think we've got some time to think about that. Yes. So first of all, I don't -- I think we have been consistent in talking about the macro pressures now for the last 3 quarters. And there isn't something that has dramatically changed since we started to warn that there were pressures in the macro space.  What I think, if we dig down a little further into the security business, I think especially in February of this year, when we saw Russia and then Ukraine, a lot of security companies expect that, that would be a tailwind to their business. What I think actually ended up happening was that, that tailwind did not materialize, and that the threat that the Russians are coming turned out to not be something which was showed up outside of the Ukrainian theater.  However, in the last several months, and especially in Q3, we started to see an increase in cyberattacks coming out of both Russia and other parts of the world. That drives increasing adoption of products like Cloudflare's products at a very, very, very high velocity. So where we'll see close rates that you can often measure in hours or days.  And so I think that, that expectation of the war in Ukraine and other political conflicts around the rest of the world leading to more security business was something that I think a lot of the industry expected would show up in Q1 and Q2, and we actually saw it show up more in Q3.  But generally, the overall macro environment hasn't changed substantially throughout this entire year based on what we're seeing. And so I want to make it clear that we're not saying that we're seeing a big change. We have seen that there was softness in the macro economy since Q1, and we've been talking about it since Q1. Yes. I don't think -- again, we have not seen an uptick in overall churn across the business. That has continued to hold very, very strong. And so we haven't changed how we've handicapped the renewal forecast. I mean, I think that there's -- I think that you've had a series of head stakes from the hardware space for quite some time going back to the Trump tax cuts that moved forward a lot of incentives on CapEx spending, the beginning of COVID where everyone was just scrambling to keep the lights on and then the supply chain crisis, which again made people place orders just to get in line for products that they may not eventually even want to have.  So it is in the grand course of history, you can't solve the problems of a distributed workforce, you can't solve the problems in the cloud by shipping a box or a virtual box. It just doesn't work. And so I think that anything that gets the market back to being rational without any kind of sort of artificial incentives to continue to invest in hardware is definitely beneficial for Cloudflare and other cloud-based security solutions. So first of all, our pay-as-you-go business is a relatively small portion of our business. It's much less than 20% of revenue. And so I think that what we see as the value from that pay-as-you-go business is that those customers, whether they pay us something or not, end up being our biggest advocates and our biggest champions inside whatever large organization that they operate at.  So if you look at who are our largest customers and you go down the top 10 customers, almost all of them came to us originally because some technical leader inside that organization used Cloudflare's pay-as-you-go services, fell in love with us, understood us and was able to adopt us as part of that. And so I think that, that benefit is so substantial to us that we always want to make sure that we're treating those customers well.  And so as Thomas said, well, they may go from paying us $20 a month to not paying us something because gas prices went up, that isn't something that we're trying to optimize for. What we're trying to optimize for is that those customers love us, they understand us and they take us to work. And so as they do, that's how we've been able to close so much of the Fortune 500. Behind almost every 1 of those Fortune 500 wins is a pay-as-you-go customer who advocated for us internally, and that is our secret sales force. Yes, Jim. I think our -- different companies are built in different ways. And so if you look at Cisco, they were very much an M&A and acquisition machine, whereas if you look at an Apple, they do M&A, but it's usually for core technologies. It's not for products. I think we are much more like an Apple than we are like a Cisco. We have watched as some of the competitors in the space have really tie themselves up in not building what is effectively a Frankenstein-type solution through a series of M&A, and they don't get the same level of efficiency that we do.  And so I think that we will always be biased against M&A, and we will always have a very high hurdle rate to do any sort of a transaction, which isn't to say we won't do transactions. When we find great technologies, great teams, great ways to integrate like we did with Area 1, we will jump on that. And as the valuations and multiples, especially in some of the private markets, continue to fall, we look at lots and lots of deals. But I don't think that, that has changed that relative to other companies, I think we're going to maintain a very high hurdle rate. We have very much optimized around internal development.  And as Marc said in his responses, we believe we can get to $5 billion without having to build or buy any new products or companies that are out there. We think we've got the right products in the bag today. It's just a matter of us continuing to execute on the go-to-market side. Just wanted to thank everyone on Cloudflare's team for delivering what has been, again, another strong quarter. We're proud of the fact that we're protecting the U.S. elections, and we're standing by to make sure that they go off smoothly.  I also want to specifically thank Chris for his nearly 10 years of service at Cloudflare, and appreciate all that he's doing to transition and get Marc on board. And to wish Jayson, good luck in his new role as CFO, assigning all of those SEC statements, hopefully, won't keep him up too much at night. And I know that he's going to do an amazing job going forward.  Thank you all for being investors. Look forward to talking again next quarter."

It was very clear from that very first meeting that the opportunity Cloudflare had was just incredible.  Fast forward to present day, and I'm so proud of the team we've built that brings Cloudflare's products to market to solve real problems for our customers. It is a truly world-class organization doing amazing work.  And as Matthew said, I had a terrific run, and I decided the $1 billion mark was the right time for me to transition out and bring in another leader for the next phase of Cloudflare's growth. I worked closely with the team to help identify the great leader we found to do that, and I'll continue to be involved to help with a smooth transition through at least the end of the year.  What a great 10-year journey it's been, and I'll always believe the Cloudflare orange. Back to you, Matthew."

I was very fortunate to attend Cloudflare's recent Customer Day in San Francisco. In all my years at similar events, I've never seen more engaged customers of all types who are eager to do more with us as a strategic partner.  Let me tell you what's especially compelling about Cloudflare, is the breadth of solutions that are a part of our platform today. We don't need to go out and buy companies. We don't need to invent new technologies. I see a clear path to $5 billion in 5 years simply by selling what we already have in the bag to the customers that already know us. That's an incredible opportunity in what compelled me to join the Cloudflare team. Back to you, Matthew."

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jayson. Even with the increased economic uncertainty, we had a very strong quarter. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $234 million, up 54% year-over-year. We added a record 212 new large customers, those paying us more than $100,000 per year, and now have 1,749 customers over this threshold. These large customers now represent 60% of our revenue, up from 50% six quarters ago. This trend illustrates how large, established enterprises increasingly form the foundation of Cloudflare's business. In fact, today, 29% of the Fortune 1,000 are already paying Cloudflare customers, a nearly threefold increase over when we went public less than three years ago. Our dollar-based net retention remained strong at 126%, down 1% over last quarter. While there may be some noise in this number from quarter-to-quarter, we won't be satisfied until it's above 130% and best of breed among the companies we consider peers. Our gross margin remained strong at 78.9%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and still over our long-term target of 75% to 77%. Our operating margin was right at breakeven, which continues to be our plan so long as we can deliver strong growth. What I'm watching closely is our free cash flow margin. It showed significant improvement quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to forecast it will be positive in the second half of the year. On our last earnings call, I got a lot of raised eyebrows from many of you when I said Q1 of 2022 would prove to be the hardest quarter for our industry since Q1 of 2020. It didn't make me particularly popular around the CEO club, where the first rule of recession is not to talk about recession. However, transparency has always been one of Cloudflare's core values, so I'm going to call it like I see it. In that spirit, let me share some more details of what we saw and are seeing. In Q1, our pipeline generation slowed, sales cycles extended, and customers took longer to pay their bills. We watched those metrics closely throughout Q2 and saw them all at least stabilized. They're not where we throw up hooray yet, but the metrics are trending in the right direction. Given our visibility early into the economic downturn, we rapidly adjusted our go-to-market message. We shifted our messaging to focus on ROI, helping customers save money and consolidating spend from multiple point solution vendors behind Cloudflare's broad platform. Messages about saving money and using fewer vendors didn't particularly resonate a year ago, but they do today. Having a broad platform to solve so many customers' problems while at the same time saving the money is a superpower in times like these. As I look at our wins in the first half of the year, I believe it's fair to say that it's harder today than it was a year ago to sign up a new customer, but it's gotten easier to talk to our broad set of existing customers about doing more with us. And customers are leaning forward to hear about how we can save the money, reduce their IT complexity, all while increasing their security, performance and reliability. I'm not a member of the National Board of Economic Advisers, so I'm not the person to say whether we're in a recession or not, how bad it may be or how quickly we may rebound. But I am the CEO of Cloudflare. And while our business remains strong, I believe this is a time for prudence and caution. The metaphor I've been using with our team is to talk about the different conditions you may face driving a car on the road. A year ago, we could see for miles and the road was clear, so it made sense to open up the throttle. Today, we find ourselves in what my grandmother used to call it tule fog. The road ahead is less certain, so it makes sense to keep our hands on the wheel, our eyes on the road and let up a bit on the accelerator. Whether we're in one or not, recessions suck. They hurt everyone. No company is recession-proof. But some are more recession-resilient than others. Some things I know are universally true. No matter how bad this recession may get, companies aren't going to abandon the Internet. They're not going to give up on the cloud and go back to on-premise boxes and packaged software. Hackers aren't going to stop hacking, so cybersecurity will remain a must-have, not a nice to have. And we're already seeing evidence of all of this, with our gross renewal rate in every region for the first half of the year, hitting all-time highs since we went public. We are not recession-proof, but I wouldn't trade places with any other CEO right now. Personally, if I think back, my career has been defined by recessions, I think a lot of people\u2019s are. Recessions have always been hard, but they're also formative moments to focus and ultimately improve. In 2000, as the first dotcom bubble first, the law firm I was supposed to go workforce that they didn't need any more securities lawyers, but they could probably find a spot for me in their bankruptcy practice. At just that time, you reflect on whether watching companies and flows was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life and pivoted to become an entrepreneur. 14 years ago, in 2008, at the onset of the last global recession, Google pulled their full-time offers for all their summer interns, which included my co-founder at Cloudflare, Michelle Zatlyn. If that hadn't happened, Cloudflare would have never been born. At the same time, I learned what a margin call was and, simply embarrassingly, literally had to borrow money from my mom to pay my rent. That's when I got an extremely personal lesson on the importance of free cash flow, and it's why I'm ensuring right now in this uncertain time that Cloudflare is prioritizing being free cash flow positive. Tough times force you to reevaluate everything you've done and become better. It's why the best companies come out of tough times even stronger than they went in. So, maybe it's a bit masochistic but I'm looking forward to have Cloudflare get even better during some of the tough times for the global economy that seem likely ahead. Hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, letting up a bit on the accelerator. With that background and to avoid being too much of a bummer, let's talk about some great customer wins in the quarter. A Fortune 500 retailer in Europe signed a $1 million three-year deal for multiple Cloudflare products. They wanted to reduce their operational complexity by replacing a number of point solutions with Cloudflare's broad platform. We became their web application firewall, content delivery network, bot management system and a number of other application protection services with our easy-to-manage platform. Having proven success protecting their infrastructure, we're now talking to them about expanding to be their Zero Trust provider, too. A Fortune 500 energy company signed a $784,000 three-year deal. They had been using Zscaler. They found Cloudflare solutions easier to use, more performant and integrate it across their full security control plane. As I said last quarter, we like our win rates when we go head-to-head with Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks because our product is better and can scale to meet the needs of complex organizations like this one. And while we're still relatively new to the Zero Trust space, we're going head-to-head against them more and more often. Yet another Fortune 500 industrial company signed a $1.3 million five-year upsell agreement. This customer first adopted Cloudflare in Q1 of 2022 and is already seeing ways they can use more of our platform. What's also notable is this is an example of us increasingly working with channel partners. We believe channel sales are especially important in the Zero Trust space. And in Q2, we successfully signed up half of Zscaler's top channel partners as new Cloudflare partners. The State of Arizona expanded their use of our platform, signing a $770,000 one-year expansion deal. Arizona has been a long time Cloudflare customer and continues to expand the use of our platform as we launch new products. I still remember their first PO with us from several years back, which specified the address and method of shipping of our products as if we are a hardware vendor. We shipped them T-shirts, not hardware, and they have continued to grow with us ever since. One of the world's largest advertising conglomerates signed a $1.7 million one-year deal. They originally came to us last quarter under an attack that originated out of Russia. Seeing the power of our platform, this quarter, they expanded their engagement. This was yet another competitive Zero Trust deal against other leading Zero Trust vendors. Like we're hearing over and over again, this customer chose Cloudflare because of the strength of our broad platform and our ease of use. In the words of their head of cloud, \u201cWith Cloudflare everything works, there are no issues\u201d. One of the largest online recruiting firm signed a $5.5 million three-year deal. They were an extremely technical buyer who put our entire platform to its paces. In the end, they demonstrated for themselves that we were, by far, the best of breed. This is also an example of how increasingly we're seeing executives bring Cloudflare to their new workplaces. In this case, the buyer knew us from his previous position and was our champion when he moved jobs and was promoted. In his words, \u201cYou don't get fired for buying Cloudflare\u201d. Workers continues to gain traction among developers. Last earnings call, I talked about the importance of building Workers into other platforms as the best shortcut to developer adoption. In Q2, we signed deals with one of the largest e-commerce platform, one of the fastest-growing web development platform and a next-generation database platform to embed Workers as a service as a preferred development environment. These deals represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in guaranteed revenue with upside as usage grows. But more importantly, we believe they are the fastest path to catalyzing a robust ecosystem around Cloudflare Workers and exposing its power to the broad community of developers. Another interesting thing to note from the quarter is we're increasingly seeing other security companies adopting Cloudflare as the best-of-breed solution. It's incredibly affirming when your peers choose your product. A public security compliance vendor, a leading endpoint security provider and one of the largest data security vendors all signed multiyear contracts each worth more than $700,000. Even our direct competitors often use Cloudflare for DDoS mitigation and other services where we are the clear leader. This recognition by our peers of our best-of-breed products continues to validate why I'm confident Cloudflare will continue to grow even stronger through the tough economic times that may be ahead. One last thing in the spirit of transparency before I turn it over to Thomas. We had a bug in our billing system related to how we expire unused credits for pay-as-you-go customers. Before we went public for good accounting reasons, we put in place a policy where we expired unused credits after three years. That system triggered for the first time earlier this year. Unfortunately, a bug in it caused our systems to report a spike in total paying customers last quarter. The revenue involved is not material, less than $160,000, and it caused us to over-report the number of paying customers last quarter. The correct numbers are 148,184 in Q1 and 151,803 in Q2. Our pay-as-you-go business is only 11% of our revenue today, but we believe it's important to continue to invest in it in order to serve the entire market and protect our play. I'm embarrassed by the mistake, and we've fixed the bug and put in place checks designed to catch any similar errors in the future. I don't like it when we make mistakes. But I do think it's important we be transparent and own them when we do, which is why I insisted on addressing this today. It also leaves more fun topics for Thomas. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas to walk through the financials. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We delivered another strong quarter driven by strength in our large customers with a record number of large customer additions as we continue to build our expansion engine. Our success in the first half of this year reflects the investments in our innovation and large enterprise go-to-market initiatives as well as the benefits of operating a durable, subscription-based revenue model. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 54% year-over-year to $234.5 million. The growth in revenue was driven by strong adoption of our product portfolio and continued traction with our enterprise customer base. Area 1, the e-mail security company we acquired in April, contributed less than 1% of revenue. From a geographic perspective, we saw continued strength in both, the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 55% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 54% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 43% year-over-year. We are pleased to see growth continue to accelerate in APAC. Turning to our customer metrics. In the second quarter, we had 151,800 paying customers, representing an increase of 20% year-over-year. We saw a higher level of churn due in part to pay-as-you go customers shifting down to our free customer tier. As our business continues to move up market, the total revenue contribution from our pay-as-you-go business which largely reflects SMB continues to decline, representing 11% of revenue in the second quarter, down from 14% in 2021 as disclosed at our Investor Day in May. Turning to large customers. We ended the quarter with 1,749 large customers, representing an increase of 61% year-over-year, and a record addition of 212 large customers in the quarter. We were pleased to see large customer revenue contribution increase again sequentially. We continue to move up market, shipping products and features that are enterprise grade, and that is reflected in our large customer cohorts, consistently increasing size and revenue contribution. Significant expansion from our large customers contributed to a dollar-based net retention of 126%, representing a decrease of 100 basis points sequentially and an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. While we expect DNR to continue to trend upward over time, we expect some variability quarter-to-quarter. Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 78.9%, representing an increase of 20 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 13% of revenue in the second quarter. We continue to expect some level of quarter-to-quarter variability given strategic purchase decisions and continue to expect network CapEx to be 12% to 14% of revenue for fiscal 2022. Turning to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 3% sequentially and decreased 2% year-over-year to 79%. We had another strong hiring quarter, where we saw our total number of employees increased 49% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to approximately 3,060 at the end of the quarter. As we look forward into the second half of 2022, we plan to slow the velocity of hiring given global macroeconomic uncertainty. We also see an opportunity to raise the bar on new hire additions given dislocations in the market. Sales and marketing expenses were $103.9 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased 2% sequentially and decreased to 44% from 45% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $46.2 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and stayed flat from 20% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $35.8 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue stayed flat sequentially and decreased to 15% from 16% in the same quarter last year. Operating loss was $891,000 compared to an operating loss of $4 million in the same period last year. Second quarter operating margin was negative 0.4%, improving 220 basis points year-over-year. If not for our acquisition and continued investment in Area 1, we would have been operating profit positive. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $312,000 or net income per share of $0.00. Tax expense for the quarter were $793,000. We ended the second quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $4.4 million in the second quarter or 2% of revenue compared to a negative $9.8 million or 6% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was $38.3 million in the second quarter or 16% of revenue compared to $7.5 million or 5% of revenue in the same period last year. We will be diligent in balancing operational discipline moving forward. We have a heightened focus on free cash flow while maintaining profitability at or near breakeven with continued investment to address the enormous opportunity in front of us. As mentioned in prior quarters, we continue to expect to return to positive free cash flow in the second half of 2022. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $760 million, representing an increase of 10% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. Current RPO was 76% of total RPO. Before we move to guidance for the third quarter and full year, I would like to provide additional color on our expectations in light of the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Similar to the early days of COVID, we performed rigorous analysis to understand both the risks and opportunities in the current environment. However, while COVID particularly affected a narrow set of industries, the current challenges impact a broader set of verticals, which is why we believe it's important for us to be more prudent in this quarter's guidance. Headwinds from foreign exchange have also accelerated. And with our product portfolio priced in U.S. dollars, our products are becoming more expensive internationally. And while we haven't seen a material change in our customers' behavior to date, we are seeing elongated sales cycles at the high end of our business. We are cognizant of the increasingly cautious environment that factor this into our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $250 million to $251 million, representing an increase of 45% to 46% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $0.0 million to $1 million. We expect net income per share of breakeven to $0.01, assuming approximately 342 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $1.9 million. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $968 million to $972 million, representing an increase of 47% to 48% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $7 million to $11 million. We expect net income per share over that period in the range of $0.03 to $0.04, assuming approximately 343 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $6.4 million. We are fortunate to be uniquely positioned as a provider of mission-critical services to our customers. And while there are challenges in the economy, we remain excited about the opportunity in front of us. We'd like to thank the Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication and resiliency in delivering exceptional service to our customers, partners and communities. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thank you very much for the question. And congrats on the results in a tough environment. Maybe Thomas, for you, Matthew had a lot of helpful commentary, and I think we appreciate the candor. You mentioned longer sales cycles, but you still increased your full year guide by $13 million or more than the $7 million Q2 beat. Can you talk a little bit more about specifically how you thought about levels -- embedding levels of conservatism? And are you assuming things kind of stay the same or maybe get worse from here?\nThomas Seifert: Yes. We looked at a lot of different factors impacting guidance this year, and you picked up some already. So, we continue to see elongated sales cycles at the high end of our business that is especially in the $0.5 million to $1 million bucket, and we expect that to continue. We saw also that our European business was the second best-performing region this quarter, and we've seen deterioration of performance, especially in Europe over the first and second quarter. So, we expect that the trend for sure not to improve. We also see across the board, I think, the companies are like us becoming more cautious in how they approach the business and things that are discussed twice in order to make sure that that has only been done once. So, we have not factored in our guidance that things would improve from here on moving forward, and perform rigorous analysis across verticals, across various regions and customer cohorts. And that's why you see a more prudent and more cautious guide for the third quarter and the end of the year.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. That makes sense. And then maybe just one for Matthew. The wins that you called out in Workers are exciting. I guess, I'm wondering, is there an opportunity maybe more challenged economic times for customers to start to use Workers and even more creative, maybe cost-effective higher ROI ways than they would have otherwise done so, if like you said, the road was kind of clear ahead and no clouds or fog in front of us?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think one of the really powerful things about Workers is its efficiency. And so a workload, an equivalent workload running on Workers versus running on any of the sort of traditional public clouds, AWSs, or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure, is typically significantly less expensive to run. And the technical work in order to make that happen is part of the magic of what Workers delivers. And so, we are definitely seeing especially in either new startups or people who are really realizing that they've got to make money go further. The days of just wildly spending on your cloud bill, I think, are behind us. And there are many different ways, both with Workers as well as just some of our standard products, that if you put us in front of your typical public cloud, we can often save you quite a bit of money. And so again, I think that that was a message that didn't really resonate very much a year ago, where everyone was just -- seem my money was free and people were throwing it at any problem that was out there. But I think in these particular environments where people are trying to figure out how to stretch a dollar even further, Workers and Cloudflare's platform as a whole is very effective at helping people save money.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Actually, intra-quarter was an interesting release from you guys that you talked about the Cloudflare one partner program, and Matthew, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned taking some of your competitors\u2019 top channel partners. Can you go over some of the details that you expect in terms of how this program is going to work for you guys? Is it solely focused on security? And how this is going to impact your indirect mix and profitability over the next couple of years?\nThomas Seifert: Yes. I think that -- from the early days of Cloudflare, we explored various partner programs. And the challenge was that for a lot of our early products took 5 minutes to sign up, and they just worked out of the box, and so there wasn't a lot of value to add as a value-added reseller. And so, while we had what I would call fairly standard success for the SaaS industry in working with partners, I don't think our products really facilitated getting the most out of the partner ecosystem. And especially, if all a partner is an order taker, then that's not a lot of value. I think a handful of things have happened. One is that our products have gotten more complicated, and the ability to customize them in various ways has become much richer. So for example, with Workers, what we're seeing from a partner like IBM is that they can actually develop their own intellectual property for a particular industry vertical, deploy that on Workers, and then sell that same IP over and over again. That's great for them. It really drives their services revenue, and it's great for us because it means that we are getting more leverage in what we're able to deliver through partners. The second thing is that I think we saw with Zscaler that their success with a handful of partners in selling Zero Trust products was really successful. Those products take more work to actually implement and deploy within an organization. It's not a 5-minute setup. And so, in that case, that's an area where we are able to work with partners. And in particular, we're very much following the playbook. And when we talk to the partners that are selling Zero Trust services, they all want to have more solutions in their basket to be able to bring to customers. Because in a lot of cases, the kind of previous Zero Trust solution either suffered from a lack of ability to scale, real performance bottlenecks, not having the total global coverage that global companies need, and Cloudflare addresses all of those things extremely well. So, I think that that's an opportunity for us. In terms of profitability, I think the good news is that these more complex products tend to actually be the highest margin products that we have. And so, as we were designing the program, we thought that we could have it be both margin accretive to Cloudflare while also still being very attractive to the potential partners that are bringing that to market. And so, I think that this is an area that we're watching very carefully. I think it's a part that is -- we're going to continue to invest in. It actually is also one of the hidden benefits of us acquiring Area 1 is they had a lot more experience with the channel and with partners. And so, working with the team there to really design that program has been great, and the reception from partners has been terrific. So, I think it's a win-win for us and for our partners.\nJames Fish: Very helpful, Matthew. Last one for me is a big government quarter coming up here. And obviously, you guys have -- just some integrated relationship. I guess, what are you seeing on the government agency side and that FedRAMP program? Thanks guys.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I appreciate it. We are -- it's like being in line with DMV. We've pulled our ramp number and are just waiting for it to come up for us to get our FedRAMP certification. And so we expect that we'll have very positive news for that next quarter. But we're basically at number -- we're number 84 and it's showing number 83 on the sort of red number counting board at the DMV. So, that's positive. We see across the board, not just with federal, but the example that I gave is the State of Arizona, we're seeing a lot more people adopt Cloudflare services in that government space. And so, I think that that continues to be a place where we have very strong relationships. And as we continue to get the various certifications, it will allow us to go even faster.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham & Co.\nAlex Henderson: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the context of the commentary around economic conditions. It's pretty obvious, the entire planet, the economies globally are decelerating. And particularly, Europe is under a lot of duress. But your initial comments was sort of that you saw that start to really manifest in 1Q and that it actually improved somewhat or at least stabilized in 2Q, yet you sound a lot more cautious on your thought process and so forth. And I'm wondering if there's a little bit of a disconnect between those two, the tone of those two. It doesn't sound like your business has rolled at all and sequentially got worse or more tense. But on the other side of the coin, you sound like you're being much more conservative in your outlook. So could you parse between those two a little bit?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Alex. I think that. What we see is that the environment has gotten harder. And I think we saw the first signals of that actually going back to December of 2021, and they really started to manifest in various ways, slowdown of pipeline, slowdown of customers paying their bills in Q1 of this year. And we talked about that on the last quarter earnings call. And I think some people were questioning why would we do that? What I think we've been able to do, though, because we saw that, we acknowledged it. We didn't pretend like everything was normal, was really adjust to take advantage of the situation. And so, I think one of the real powers of Cloudflare's business is the diversity of our customer sets, both on a geography and also industry basis, the diversity of our products, and that allows us to have multiple levers to be able to continue to deliver even when the times get tough. And I think if you go back to the COVID quarters, and that was definitely a time where we had to adjust how we went to market, what we did, what types of customers are we focused on. We really transitioned from being a business-driven primarily from getting new logos to one that developed a real expertise in how to go to our existing customers and sell them more. And I think there are a lot of analogies that are similar to the sort of adjustments that we've made that allowed us to have a quarter like this. But make no mistake, we're still in what my grandmother would call, a tule fog. We've still got to go out and do the work every day of filling up the wheelbarrow with new leads, sifting through it to look for what's going to be the most promising and being able to deliver. But what I like about our business is, again, it's diversity across customer types, customer sizes, products, ways that we can go to market. And I think our team has done a good job of adapting to what is a much more difficult situation today than it was a year ago.\nThomas Seifert: Alex, maybe one additional point. I pointed that out in my script, but -- and I didn't mention it in the previous answer. What we do feel is also currency headwinds, especially in Europe. So, even if the economic activity for us in terms of deal volume would be the same, we see the headwinds from a currency perspective in Europe, but also in other parts of the world, Japan, for example, that we need to digest.\nJames Fish: Yes. That actually leads me to the second question that I wanted to ask is the European environment is particularly onerous with 20% currency translation headwinds in EMEA or inflation, rising interest rates, Bank of England just raised rates 0.5% today, in fact. And given that environment, they're struggling with huge price increases, particularly on systems in local -- in dollars plus the currency translation and their budgets are fairly flat. Now, my understanding is there seems to be a separation between companies that are selling relatively low-priced/high-value technologies and companies are selling high-ticket technologies. Can you talk about whether you're aggressively low price? And the fact that you're a lower ticket upfront gives you a big advantage in that geography because of that characteristic and whether you're seeing more pressure on the higher value with the higher, bigger ticket transactions because I think ultimately, that seems to be the divining rod between who wins and loses in Europe.\nThomas Seifert: Well, I think it's certainly a benefit that our products are mission-critical. But even then, at the high end and bigger ACV deals, decision takes longer. That's where you see the elongated sales cycles. The second factor in our favor is that gross margin is one of the strong points of the business model. When we deploy that web and we always talked a bit audit as a strategic weapon where it makes sense. So that doesn't mean price cutting. We try to be strategic and accommodating where we think it makes sense to build business relationship and business. But, we're using our margin to accommodate for that without any doubt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Cohen. Your line is now open.\nShaul Eyal: Congrats on a set of results. Matthew, the first question for you. So, lots of discussions throughout the quarter, maybe some chatter around your crypto exposure, potential implications. Maybe a good opportunity here to address Cloudflare's exposure, maybe current thinking on this vertical, given the changing dynamics we've seen in recent months.\nMatthew Prince: Sure. I mean, I think that we have customers that are in that space, including a number of the large exchanges. But I don't think that there are any of them that would crack being a top 10 customer. And I think as a whole, I don't know the exact exposure, Thomas may be able to add to it. But I will say that it's not significant enough that it has been brought up as a big risk item internally. So, I think that we have always had -- I mean, I personally have never -- there's a lot of religion around the crypto space, where people are either hyperly pro crypto or hyperly against crypto. I feel like I'm the only kind of agnostic on crypto, where I don't think we have bet heavily on it. But at the same time, we've definitely made sure that if there are things that emerge from it, that we're in a position to take advantage of those. But that has not been a meaningful headwind to us.\nThomas Seifert: Yes. And maybe some color. Our exposure to crypto was less than -- was single -- mid-single digits in percent of revenue, under 5% for the second quarter. So, not a big -- an interesting part in terms of the size and the amount of customers but not a big exposure to revenue.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. And Thomas, maybe one for you, question on elongated sales cycle. I know it's a bit tricky, it differs from customer to customer. But maybe can you generalize for us how long -- how much are these cycles being elongated? Are we talking two weeks, three weeks, more than that? How could we be thinking about it? The word elongated is a very, very general term.\nThomas Seifert: Well, I would say for the main part of our business, we are still far below 90 days from a sales cycle perspective. So, when we talk about elongated sales cycles, it's in the upper end of our cohorts where you look at the bucket, $500,000 to $1 million of ACV where it's moving out. But there, it's moving out by weeks, not by days.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with Citi.\nFatima Boolani: Matthew or Thomas, jump all for either one of you. Thinking about the shift to pay-as-you-go customers, some of your observations and commentary around elongating deal cycles that you just addressed. I'm curious if you can just sort of take a step back and bifurcate for us how new logo land purchasing and procurement behavior has changed versus expansion or installed base expansion customer behavior has changed over the last three months. And maybe if you can help contextualize this or put this under the lens of your product pillars, whether there is more or less usage or slower adoption of certain pillars versus others and certainly against the hardware supply chain constraint backdrop that we're in right now.\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, I think that it has gotten harder to sign up a new logo since the beginning of the year, but it's actually gotten easier to talk to our existing customers about using more of their platform -- more of our platforms in order to solve the problems that they have. And so, I think that that where we benefit is because we have such a broad product portfolio that allows us even in these times where signing up new logos is hard. We can go to our existing customers and have a conversation about how we can simplify their IT stack, how we can save them money, how we can make them more secure. And I think that that's attractive. So, we're still signing up plenty of new logos. But I think that on balance, it has definitely gotten harder to sign up new logos and it has gotten easier to have conversations about expanding usage of our platform and especially adopting different products that are part of our platform. In terms of what products are -- how the mix of products is changing, I think security continues to be top of mind that -- I think that there was real kind of concern around when the Russian invasion of Ukraine happened that there would be attacks that went out from Russia in retaliation against western companies. That actually did not materialize in Q1, the way I think a lot of people thought it would. But we started to see more of that start to materialize in Q2. It's still -- I wouldn't call it a trend yet, but we're seeing more companies come under attack and turning to us when that happens. And so, I think this is an environment where security products do very well. And across our security portfolio, we're seeing strength.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist.\nJoel Fishbein: Matthew, at Analyst Day, you talked about acts in these large markets that Cloudflare is to go after, notwithstanding the macro environment, current macro environment. Is there anything that has changed in your philosophy about these big markets? And maybe you can just give us an update on these acts or large markets and where you're positioned maybe specifically around R2 and the big data that you have going on right now? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So, we think of Cloudflare as stacking multiple adoption S curves one behind another. And so our first acts were how do we protect the infrastructure of customers around the world. And it is incredible to see how we've been able to do that successfully where today, more than 20% of all websites use our infrastructure. We're continuing to sell those products, but I think that where we are earlier in that S curve is with our Zero Trust products, and we're able to go to all of those people who adopted our application security products and now say, \"Hey, we can help you with Zero Trust as well.\" And I think that that is the big act that we're focusing on right now. Act three for us, which I think will really start to hit in a material way around revenue in three to five years is really around Workers. And I think we have been very pleasantly surprised how that adoption has happened faster and sooner and earlier than we expected. R2, which is our object store and our Amazon S3 competitor went into public beta last quarter, and we expect that it will go into GA right at the end of Q3. And so, I think that that's an opportunity for us to do more and we continue to invest in it. And again, we think that the real durable nature of Cloudflare is that we're able to continue to stack these acts one behind another behind another.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala: Matthew, maybe a question on the security angle for you. You talked a lot about having larger platform conversations with your existing customers. Can you comment on when you talk to CIOs, CISOs at these customers, what is their willingness to really want to transform and modernize their existing security architectures versus perhaps continuing to refresh their existing on-premise date?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I mean I think Morgan Stanley is a great Cloudflare customer, and we have a terrific relationship with the CIO team over there, and it's definitely an organization that has been willing to embrace change. And we -- I think that that's a big piece. And I think that most organizations today understand that they have to make that change, and they're very willing to have that conversation. I think the thing that has changed to some extent is even those organizations that thought they could continue to invest in on-premise hardware are finding the current situation very difficult, where if you want to get a new firewall today, the lead times can be 9 months before you get it. And at the same time, the firewall vendors are raising their prices. And so, I think that a lot of -- in the results, a lot of the sort of that RPO you saw in the traditional firewall vendors was people basically holding their place in line. But it's not a way to make customers happy, telling them they have to pay more and then delaying when the product is going to be there. And so even for some of the organizations that traditionally had said, \"We don't believe in the cloud or we don't believe in moving in this direction,\" I think that, that tune is starting to change, and it's becoming very much the minority opinion that you can solve these problems with on-premise hardware.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Maybe just for Thomas, I think you talked in the script about being more judicious and slowing hiring in the back half of the year. And maybe I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about which areas are still prioritized in terms of hiring and which ones you're kind of slowing a bit more. Thanks so much.\nThomas Seifert: Yes. So, we grew quite a bit employee headcount wise in the second quarter. We said we take the velocity down quite a bit. We still prioritize go-to-market open positions and protecting people moving into the second half. So, the slowdown is in G&A and some of their R&D functions, but go-to-market is still going to continue to hire.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Maybe just a follow-up question on the operating income for the year. Your loss in Q2 is actually better than your guidance. I think you just said you're slowing hiring in the second half of the year. So, I assume the reason you lowered your operating income for the full year fiscal '22 was due to the Area 1 acquisition. And if so, could you just pull that out? Maybe tell us what your organic revenue and operating income would have been outside of that acquisition?\nThomas Seifert: Yes. I don't want to give more -- much more specific than the color we gave on our -- in our script. But it is true with a couple of moving parts. Without the continued investment in Area 1, we would have been operating margin positive, probably more in the single-digit, mid-digit million dollar range for the second quarter.\nAndrew Nowinski: And I assume the operating guidance for the year would have gone up in absence of that acquisition then?\nThomas Seifert: We gave guidance for the quarter that took into account a lot of variables, and I am not going to parcel out now with the specific impact of Area 1 would have been -- if we hadn't done that acquisition. So, guidance is the holistic picture on many things that move, and you should take it as that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh with JMP Securities.\nTrevor Walsh: Matthew, maybe a quick one for you around your comments around DBNR. You mentioned your aspirational goal of 130%. What do you think is -- how do you get there? Is it kind of a function kind of where you're right now based on macroeconomics and just what's going on in terms of budgets, or is there something internally that you guys are looking to maybe change and/or kind of refocus efforts on in order to drive that number up? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that it really is for us about how we bundle products together. Today, 29% of the Fortune 1000 are already Cloudflare customers. If you fast forward with that, I think that a very significant percentage of the Fortune 1000 are going to be customers. And so, what we really want to focus on is how do we get them to use more of our platform. And what I think is unique about Cloudflare is we've already got the products in place where we can have those customers adopt our -- more and more our platform. There is not a single customer that uses every single feature of Cloudflare's platform today in terms of a contracted customer. And so, I think that's where we really see that growing. And I think that's a very healthy way to expand spend with customers is to become more and more critical. What we want to be is the network that the Fortune 1000 relies on for connecting to the internet, making sure that they're secure, making sure that their employees have the best experience possible and making sure that no matter what happens, they're always going to be online.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair.\nJames Breen: Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx? It's up a bit this quarter, a little bit higher than the guidance for the year, the range for the year. And how you think about that spending going forward? And maybe some of the puts and takes on cash flow relative to top line growth and where are areas where you can generate cash without too greatly impacting the top line? Thanks.\nThomas Seifert: Maybe I could start on CapEx. I mean, we're going to stay within the range that we guided for the year. We said before, you will see variability quarter-to-quarter just in terms of how we purchase, where we see opportunity to pull in spend and make sure that we maneuver ourselves smartly around the supply chain disruptions you see. This is pretty much driving the variability quarter-to-quarter, but we will stay within the range we guided for the year. From a free cash flow perspective, we said we have a lot of levers at hand. One of the biggest levers is moving to annual billing for our large customers. We are, from a company history perspective coming from a pay-as-you-go business where people gave us a credit card even at the beginning of the second quarter, the majority of our revenue was monthly billing. So, we've made first ride into that direction of annual billing. And there is a lot of opportunities still in front of us. So this, I would say, is the biggest lever, but we run a pretty holistic cash conversion project across the Company that looks into literally anything that can positively impact free cash flow generation. And it's a cross-functional project, and it's -- we're making good progress, and you saw that already reflected in the second quarter numbers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with BTIG.\nGray Powell: All right. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations for the -- on the strong results. So, yes, Matt, you called out the Fortune 500 energy company where you replaced Zscaler. And then you talked about some other similar wins. I just want to make sure I have it correct. Are those mainly on the ZTNA side with Cloudflare Access, or were there some gateway wins as well? And then, maybe can you just drill into a little bit more and talk about like why you won. Is it more on price, technology or a combination of those?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So, when we sell our Zero Trust solutions, we really believe that the pieces all fit together. And so those are typically wins. Sometimes somebody will just -- will just adopt one portion of the solution, but we really like to sell that holistic solution and see how all of the pieces fit together. In terms of where we win, I think what we hear from the space is that our products are significantly more performant. We have a much more holistic solution where we can protect mobile devices in a way that a lot of the other providers can't. We can work across the geographies. When I was, this time last year, traveling in Africa using our products, they worked great, whereas most people in the space don't have that broad of a network that can deliver that. And I think that we are just able to scale much more significantly. We have literally two orders of magnitude, more capacity to be able to handle the forward proxy traffic across us than any of the other providers in the space. And I think that that's why we've been able to displace some companies that have used -- that have tried to adopt Zscaler and found it less user-friendly and that it generated a lot of IT support tickets. But that's really not our focus. Our focus is going after all of the on-premise firewalls and hardware and VPNs that exist in the universe. And so, I think they can be successful and we can be successful, but I think we have a better product. And over time, I think that will help us win.\nOperator: Your final question today comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Matthew, on Area 1, I know it's early, but can you give us an update of what you're seeing there? And I guess, again, on the last question, can I squeeze one in at the end? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: The Area 1 tech is amazing. So, the product, we're seeing really great wins from very large customers. And we think of that product as being a gateway to help with people on their Zero Trust journey. If you think about e-mail, the nature of it is it enumerates the employee directory of an organization, and it very much then helps us sell the other Zero Trust products that we have, and so that conversation is going well. It's also a conversation that is going well in terms of talking to our existing customers. It turns out everybody has got a phishing problem. It is for most of our customers, one click to sign up and test whether or not Area 1 can result in that. And so, we're seeing $1 million-plus wins that close in -- oftentimes in a matter of days or a short number of weeks, which is just -- because we can just prove how successful that is. I think beyond that, Area 1 has helped us in a number of other ways. One, as I mentioned earlier, is that they had a much more sophisticated channel program, which has now helped develop our channel program, and I think we're really thankful for that team being on board. And then, the third, which I think you'll hear us talk about more going forward is that they have a really world-class threat intelligence team. And that, I think, will turn into more products across our entire platform. And because I like you Brent, I'll let you have one more question.\nBrent Thill: I appreciate that. You've had the crystal ball and everyone appreciates your candor, and I think you were the first one to come out and say, hey, things are feeling a little different than they felt. I was just trying to understand, when you look at the perspective of what's happening now, you mentioned things have stabilized. I mean, I just want to make sure we understand from your perspective, it hasn't gotten worse. It's come in that your -- the stabilization trend that you're seeing, have you seen that extend into July and the rest of the summer. What's your sense of kind of the trajectory from where things came in, where are you at now?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, you got me in trouble with a lot of my peers at your conference, where I said that the economy was not as rosy as people think, and I think you've heard a lot of those folks echo those comments now in Q2. Let me be clear. I think that the economy is still in really rough shape. And I don't know -- and again, I'm not a member of the -- I'm not an economist. But from what we hear from customers, customers are really still suffering, And the economy, I wouldn't say that the economy itself has stabilized. What I would say is we have had the flexibility in our business to be able to adapt to a very difficult environment. That environment continues to be difficult, and I think it will be difficult at least through the rest of the year. But being able to deliver products that deliver real value, have an incredible ROI, can save customers' money and are must haves, not nice to haves, puts us in an incredibly powerful position. And as I said in the prepared remarks, I would not trade places with any other CEO.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A portion of the call. Matthew Prince, I turn the call back to you.\nMatthew Prince: So, I'd like to, first of all, thank a bunch of the students from the Berklee School of Music to let us use some of their new and original songs for the hope music, going, going in. So, hopefully those of you who tuned in the call early, you appreciated that. I also want to thank the analysts for actually asking Thomas some questions this time. Usually, I get all the questions. Thanks to our team and all of our customers. We've got our hands on the wheel, our eyes on the road, and we'll see you all back here next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We delivered another strong quarter driven by strength in our large customers with a record number of large customer additions as we continue to build our expansion engine. Our success in the first half of this year reflects the investments in our innovation and large enterprise go-to-market initiatives as well as the benefits of operating a durable, subscription-based revenue model. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 54% year-over-year to $234.5 million. The growth in revenue was driven by strong adoption of our product portfolio and continued traction with our enterprise customer base. Area 1, the e-mail security company we acquired in April, contributed less than 1% of revenue. From a geographic perspective, we saw continued strength in both, the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 55% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 54% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 43% year-over-year. We are pleased to see growth continue to accelerate in APAC. Turning to our customer metrics. In the second quarter, we had 151,800 paying customers, representing an increase of 20% year-over-year. We saw a higher level of churn due in part to pay-as-you go customers shifting down to our free customer tier. As our business continues to move up market, the total revenue contribution from our pay-as-you-go business which largely reflects SMB continues to decline, representing 11% of revenue in the second quarter, down from 14% in 2021 as disclosed at our Investor Day in May. Turning to large customers. We ended the quarter with 1,749 large customers, representing an increase of 61% year-over-year, and a record addition of 212 large customers in the quarter. We were pleased to see large customer revenue contribution increase again sequentially. We continue to move up market, shipping products and features that are enterprise grade, and that is reflected in our large customer cohorts, consistently increasing size and revenue contribution. Significant expansion from our large customers contributed to a dollar-based net retention of 126%, representing a decrease of 100 basis points sequentially and an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. While we expect DNR to continue to trend upward over time, we expect some variability quarter-to-quarter. Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 78.9%, representing an increase of 20 basis points sequentially. Network CapEx represented 13% of revenue in the second quarter. We continue to expect some level of quarter-to-quarter variability given strategic purchase decisions and continue to expect network CapEx to be 12% to 14% of revenue for fiscal 2022. Turning to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 3% sequentially and decreased 2% year-over-year to 79%. We had another strong hiring quarter, where we saw our total number of employees increased 49% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to approximately 3,060 at the end of the quarter. As we look forward into the second half of 2022, we plan to slow the velocity of hiring given global macroeconomic uncertainty. We also see an opportunity to raise the bar on new hire additions given dislocations in the market. Sales and marketing expenses were $103.9 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased 2% sequentially and decreased to 44% from 45% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $46.2 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and stayed flat from 20% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $35.8 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue stayed flat sequentially and decreased to 15% from 16% in the same quarter last year. Operating loss was $891,000 compared to an operating loss of $4 million in the same period last year. Second quarter operating margin was negative 0.4%, improving 220 basis points year-over-year. If not for our acquisition and continued investment in Area 1, we would have been operating profit positive. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $312,000 or net income per share of $0.00. Tax expense for the quarter were $793,000. We ended the second quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $4.4 million in the second quarter or 2% of revenue compared to a negative $9.8 million or 6% of revenue in the same period last year. Operating cash flow was $38.3 million in the second quarter or 16% of revenue compared to $7.5 million or 5% of revenue in the same period last year. We will be diligent in balancing operational discipline moving forward. We have a heightened focus on free cash flow while maintaining profitability at or near breakeven with continued investment to address the enormous opportunity in front of us. As mentioned in prior quarters, we continue to expect to return to positive free cash flow in the second half of 2022. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $760 million, representing an increase of 10% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. Current RPO was 76% of total RPO. Before we move to guidance for the third quarter and full year, I would like to provide additional color on our expectations in light of the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Similar to the early days of COVID, we performed rigorous analysis to understand both the risks and opportunities in the current environment. However, while COVID particularly affected a narrow set of industries, the current challenges impact a broader set of verticals, which is why we believe it's important for us to be more prudent in this quarter's guidance. Headwinds from foreign exchange have also accelerated. And with our product portfolio priced in U.S. dollars, our products are becoming more expensive internationally. And while we haven't seen a material change in our customers' behavior to date, we are seeing elongated sales cycles at the high end of our business. We are cognizant of the increasingly cautious environment that factor this into our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $250 million to $251 million, representing an increase of 45% to 46% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $0.0 million to $1 million. We expect net income per share of breakeven to $0.01, assuming approximately 342 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $1.9 million. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $968 million to $972 million, representing an increase of 47% to 48% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $7 million to $11 million. We expect net income per share over that period in the range of $0.03 to $0.04, assuming approximately 343 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $6.4 million. We are fortunate to be uniquely positioned as a provider of mission-critical services to our customers. And while there are challenges in the economy, we remain excited about the opportunity in front of us. We'd like to thank the Cloudflare employees for their continued dedication and resiliency in delivering exceptional service to our customers, partners and communities. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Yes. We looked at a lot of different factors impacting guidance this year, and you picked up some already. So, we continue to see elongated sales cycles at the high end of our business that is especially in the $0.5 million to $1 million bucket, and we expect that to continue. We saw also that our European business was the second best-performing region this quarter, and we've seen deterioration of performance, especially in Europe over the first and second quarter. So, we expect that the trend for sure not to improve. We also see across the board, I think, the companies are like us becoming more cautious in how they approach the business and things that are discussed twice in order to make sure that that has only been done once. So, we have not factored in our guidance that things would improve from here on moving forward, and perform rigorous analysis across verticals, across various regions and customer cohorts. And that's why you see a more prudent and more cautious guide for the third quarter and the end of the year. Yes. I think that -- from the early days of Cloudflare, we explored various partner programs. And the challenge was that for a lot of our early products took 5 minutes to sign up, and they just worked out of the box, and so there wasn't a lot of value to add as a value-added reseller. And so, while we had what I would call fairly standard success for the SaaS industry in working with partners, I don't think our products really facilitated getting the most out of the partner ecosystem. And especially, if all a partner is an order taker, then that's not a lot of value. I think a handful of things have happened. One is that our products have gotten more complicated, and the ability to customize them in various ways has become much richer. So for example, with Workers, what we're seeing from a partner like IBM is that they can actually develop their own intellectual property for a particular industry vertical, deploy that on Workers, and then sell that same IP over and over again. That's great for them. It really drives their services revenue, and it's great for us because it means that we are getting more leverage in what we're able to deliver through partners. The second thing is that I think we saw with Zscaler that their success with a handful of partners in selling Zero Trust products was really successful. Those products take more work to actually implement and deploy within an organization. It's not a 5-minute setup. And so, in that case, that's an area where we are able to work with partners. And in particular, we're very much following the playbook. And when we talk to the partners that are selling Zero Trust services, they all want to have more solutions in their basket to be able to bring to customers. Because in a lot of cases, the kind of previous Zero Trust solution either suffered from a lack of ability to scale, real performance bottlenecks, not having the total global coverage that global companies need, and Cloudflare addresses all of those things extremely well. So, I think that that's an opportunity for us. In terms of profitability, I think the good news is that these more complex products tend to actually be the highest margin products that we have. And so, as we were designing the program, we thought that we could have it be both margin accretive to Cloudflare while also still being very attractive to the potential partners that are bringing that to market. And so, I think that this is an area that we're watching very carefully. I think it's a part that is -- we're going to continue to invest in. It actually is also one of the hidden benefits of us acquiring Area 1 is they had a lot more experience with the channel and with partners. And so, working with the team there to really design that program has been great, and the reception from partners has been terrific. So, I think it's a win-win for us and for our partners. Alex, maybe one additional point. I pointed that out in my script, but -- and I didn't mention it in the previous answer. What we do feel is also currency headwinds, especially in Europe. So, even if the economic activity for us in terms of deal volume would be the same, we see the headwinds from a currency perspective in Europe, but also in other parts of the world, Japan, for example, that we need to digest. Well, I think it's certainly a benefit that our products are mission-critical. But even then, at the high end and bigger ACV deals, decision takes longer. That's where you see the elongated sales cycles. The second factor in our favor is that gross margin is one of the strong points of the business model. When we deploy that web and we always talked a bit audit as a strategic weapon where it makes sense. So that doesn't mean price cutting. We try to be strategic and accommodating where we think it makes sense to build business relationship and business. But, we're using our margin to accommodate for that without any doubt. Yes. And maybe some color. Our exposure to crypto was less than -- was single -- mid-single digits in percent of revenue, under 5% for the second quarter. So, not a big -- an interesting part in terms of the size and the amount of customers but not a big exposure to revenue. Well, I would say for the main part of our business, we are still far below 90 days from a sales cycle perspective. So, when we talk about elongated sales cycles, it's in the upper end of our cohorts where you look at the bucket, $500,000 to $1 million of ACV where it's moving out. But there, it's moving out by weeks, not by days. Yes. So, we grew quite a bit employee headcount wise in the second quarter. We said we take the velocity down quite a bit. We still prioritize go-to-market open positions and protecting people moving into the second half. So, the slowdown is in G&A and some of their R&D functions, but go-to-market is still going to continue to hire. Yes. I don't want to give more -- much more specific than the color we gave on our -- in our script. But it is true with a couple of moving parts. Without the continued investment in Area 1, we would have been operating margin positive, probably more in the single-digit, mid-digit million dollar range for the second quarter. We gave guidance for the quarter that took into account a lot of variables, and I am not going to parcel out now with the specific impact of Area 1 would have been -- if we hadn't done that acquisition. So, guidance is the holistic picture on many things that move, and you should take it as that. Maybe I could start on CapEx. I mean, we're going to stay within the range that we guided for the year. We said before, you will see variability quarter-to-quarter just in terms of how we purchase, where we see opportunity to pull in spend and make sure that we maneuver ourselves smartly around the supply chain disruptions you see. This is pretty much driving the variability quarter-to-quarter, but we will stay within the range we guided for the year. From a free cash flow perspective, we said we have a lot of levers at hand. One of the biggest levers is moving to annual billing for our large customers. We are, from a company history perspective coming from a pay-as-you-go business where people gave us a credit card even at the beginning of the second quarter, the majority of our revenue was monthly billing. So, we've made first ride into that direction of annual billing. And there is a lot of opportunities still in front of us. So this, I would say, is the biggest lever, but we run a pretty holistic cash conversion project across the Company that looks into literally anything that can positively impact free cash flow generation. And it's a cross-functional project, and it's -- we're making good progress, and you saw that already reflected in the second quarter numbers."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Jayson. Even with the increased economic uncertainty, we had a very strong quarter. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $234 million, up 54% year-over-year. We added a record 212 new large customers, those paying us more than $100,000 per year, and now have 1,749 customers over this threshold. These large customers now represent 60% of our revenue, up from 50% six quarters ago. This trend illustrates how large, established enterprises increasingly form the foundation of Cloudflare's business. In fact, today, 29% of the Fortune 1,000 are already paying Cloudflare customers, a nearly threefold increase over when we went public less than three years ago. Our dollar-based net retention remained strong at 126%, down 1% over last quarter. While there may be some noise in this number from quarter-to-quarter, we won't be satisfied until it's above 130% and best of breed among the companies we consider peers. Our gross margin remained strong at 78.9%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and still over our long-term target of 75% to 77%. Our operating margin was right at breakeven, which continues to be our plan so long as we can deliver strong growth. What I'm watching closely is our free cash flow margin. It showed significant improvement quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to forecast it will be positive in the second half of the year. On our last earnings call, I got a lot of raised eyebrows from many of you when I said Q1 of 2022 would prove to be the hardest quarter for our industry since Q1 of 2020. It didn't make me particularly popular around the CEO club, where the first rule of recession is not to talk about recession. However, transparency has always been one of Cloudflare's core values, so I'm going to call it like I see it. In that spirit, let me share some more details of what we saw and are seeing. In Q1, our pipeline generation slowed, sales cycles extended, and customers took longer to pay their bills. We watched those metrics closely throughout Q2 and saw them all at least stabilized. They're not where we throw up hooray yet, but the metrics are trending in the right direction. Given our visibility early into the economic downturn, we rapidly adjusted our go-to-market message. We shifted our messaging to focus on ROI, helping customers save money and consolidating spend from multiple point solution vendors behind Cloudflare's broad platform. Messages about saving money and using fewer vendors didn't particularly resonate a year ago, but they do today. Having a broad platform to solve so many customers' problems while at the same time saving the money is a superpower in times like these. As I look at our wins in the first half of the year, I believe it's fair to say that it's harder today than it was a year ago to sign up a new customer, but it's gotten easier to talk to our broad set of existing customers about doing more with us. And customers are leaning forward to hear about how we can save the money, reduce their IT complexity, all while increasing their security, performance and reliability. I'm not a member of the National Board of Economic Advisers, so I'm not the person to say whether we're in a recession or not, how bad it may be or how quickly we may rebound. But I am the CEO of Cloudflare. And while our business remains strong, I believe this is a time for prudence and caution. The metaphor I've been using with our team is to talk about the different conditions you may face driving a car on the road. A year ago, we could see for miles and the road was clear, so it made sense to open up the throttle. Today, we find ourselves in what my grandmother used to call it tule fog. The road ahead is less certain, so it makes sense to keep our hands on the wheel, our eyes on the road and let up a bit on the accelerator. Whether we're in one or not, recessions suck. They hurt everyone. No company is recession-proof. But some are more recession-resilient than others. Some things I know are universally true. No matter how bad this recession may get, companies aren't going to abandon the Internet. They're not going to give up on the cloud and go back to on-premise boxes and packaged software. Hackers aren't going to stop hacking, so cybersecurity will remain a must-have, not a nice to have. And we're already seeing evidence of all of this, with our gross renewal rate in every region for the first half of the year, hitting all-time highs since we went public. We are not recession-proof, but I wouldn't trade places with any other CEO right now. Personally, if I think back, my career has been defined by recessions, I think a lot of people's are. Recessions have always been hard, but they're also formative moments to focus and ultimately improve. In 2000, as the first dotcom bubble first, the law firm I was supposed to go workforce that they didn't need any more securities lawyers, but they could probably find a spot for me in their bankruptcy practice. At just that time, you reflect on whether watching companies and flows was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life and pivoted to become an entrepreneur. 14 years ago, in 2008, at the onset of the last global recession, Google pulled their full-time offers for all their summer interns, which included my co-founder at Cloudflare, Michelle Zatlyn. If that hadn't happened, Cloudflare would have never been born. At the same time, I learned what a margin call was and, simply embarrassingly, literally had to borrow money from my mom to pay my rent. That's when I got an extremely personal lesson on the importance of free cash flow, and it's why I'm ensuring right now in this uncertain time that Cloudflare is prioritizing being free cash flow positive. Tough times force you to reevaluate everything you've done and become better. It's why the best companies come out of tough times even stronger than they went in. So, maybe it's a bit masochistic but I'm looking forward to have Cloudflare get even better during some of the tough times for the global economy that seem likely ahead. Hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, letting up a bit on the accelerator. With that background and to avoid being too much of a bummer, let's talk about some great customer wins in the quarter. A Fortune 500 retailer in Europe signed a $1 million three-year deal for multiple Cloudflare products. They wanted to reduce their operational complexity by replacing a number of point solutions with Cloudflare's broad platform. We became their web application firewall, content delivery network, bot management system and a number of other application protection services with our easy-to-manage platform. Having proven success protecting their infrastructure, we're now talking to them about expanding to be their Zero Trust provider, too. A Fortune 500 energy company signed a $784,000 three-year deal. They had been using Zscaler. They found Cloudflare solutions easier to use, more performant and integrate it across their full security control plane. As I said last quarter, we like our win rates when we go head-to-head with Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks because our product is better and can scale to meet the needs of complex organizations like this one. And while we're still relatively new to the Zero Trust space, we're going head-to-head against them more and more often. Yet another Fortune 500 industrial company signed a $1.3 million five-year upsell agreement. This customer first adopted Cloudflare in Q1 of 2022 and is already seeing ways they can use more of our platform. What's also notable is this is an example of us increasingly working with channel partners. We believe channel sales are especially important in the Zero Trust space. And in Q2, we successfully signed up half of Zscaler's top channel partners as new Cloudflare partners. The State of Arizona expanded their use of our platform, signing a $770,000 one-year expansion deal. Arizona has been a long time Cloudflare customer and continues to expand the use of our platform as we launch new products. I still remember their first PO with us from several years back, which specified the address and method of shipping of our products as if we are a hardware vendor. We shipped them T-shirts, not hardware, and they have continued to grow with us ever since. One of the world's largest advertising conglomerates signed a $1.7 million one-year deal. They originally came to us last quarter under an attack that originated out of Russia. Seeing the power of our platform, this quarter, they expanded their engagement. This was yet another competitive Zero Trust deal against other leading Zero Trust vendors. Like we're hearing over and over again, this customer chose Cloudflare because of the strength of our broad platform and our ease of use. In the words of their head of cloud, \u201cWith Cloudflare everything works, there are no issues\u201d. One of the largest online recruiting firm signed a $5.5 million three-year deal. They were an extremely technical buyer who put our entire platform to its paces. In the end, they demonstrated for themselves that we were, by far, the best of breed. This is also an example of how increasingly we're seeing executives bring Cloudflare to their new workplaces. In this case, the buyer knew us from his previous position and was our champion when he moved jobs and was promoted. In his words, \u201cYou don't get fired for buying Cloudflare\u201d. Workers continues to gain traction among developers. Last earnings call, I talked about the importance of building Workers into other platforms as the best shortcut to developer adoption. In Q2, we signed deals with one of the largest e-commerce platform, one of the fastest-growing web development platform and a next-generation database platform to embed Workers as a service as a preferred development environment. These deals represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in guaranteed revenue with upside as usage grows. But more importantly, we believe they are the fastest path to catalyzing a robust ecosystem around Cloudflare Workers and exposing its power to the broad community of developers. Another interesting thing to note from the quarter is we're increasingly seeing other security companies adopting Cloudflare as the best-of-breed solution. It's incredibly affirming when your peers choose your product. A public security compliance vendor, a leading endpoint security provider and one of the largest data security vendors all signed multiyear contracts each worth more than $700,000. Even our direct competitors often use Cloudflare for DDoS mitigation and other services where we are the clear leader. This recognition by our peers of our best-of-breed products continues to validate why I'm confident Cloudflare will continue to grow even stronger through the tough economic times that may be ahead. One last thing in the spirit of transparency before I turn it over to Thomas. We had a bug in our billing system related to how we expire unused credits for pay-as-you-go customers. Before we went public for good accounting reasons, we put in place a policy where we expired unused credits after three years. That system triggered for the first time earlier this year. Unfortunately, a bug in it caused our systems to report a spike in total paying customers last quarter. The revenue involved is not material, less than $160,000, and it caused us to over-report the number of paying customers last quarter. The correct numbers are 148,184 in Q1 and 151,803 in Q2. Our pay-as-you-go business is only 11% of our revenue today, but we believe it's important to continue to invest in it in order to serve the entire market and protect our play. I'm embarrassed by the mistake, and we've fixed the bug and put in place checks designed to catch any similar errors in the future. I don't like it when we make mistakes. But I do think it's important we be transparent and own them when we do, which is why I insisted on addressing this today. It also leaves more fun topics for Thomas. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas to walk through the financials. Thomas, take it away. Yes. I think one of the really powerful things about Workers is its efficiency. And so a workload, an equivalent workload running on Workers versus running on any of the sort of traditional public clouds, AWSs, or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure, is typically significantly less expensive to run. And the technical work in order to make that happen is part of the magic of what Workers delivers. And so, we are definitely seeing especially in either new startups or people who are really realizing that they've got to make money go further. The days of just wildly spending on your cloud bill, I think, are behind us. And there are many different ways, both with Workers as well as just some of our standard products, that if you put us in front of your typical public cloud, we can often save you quite a bit of money. And so again, I think that that was a message that didn't really resonate very much a year ago, where everyone was just -- seem my money was free and people were throwing it at any problem that was out there. But I think in these particular environments where people are trying to figure out how to stretch a dollar even further, Workers and Cloudflare's platform as a whole is very effective at helping people save money. Yes. I appreciate it. We are -- it's like being in line with DMV. We've pulled our ramp number and are just waiting for it to come up for us to get our FedRAMP certification. And so we expect that we'll have very positive news for that next quarter. But we're basically at number -- we're number 84 and it's showing number 83 on the sort of red number counting board at the DMV. So, that's positive. We see across the board, not just with federal, but the example that I gave is the State of Arizona, we're seeing a lot more people adopt Cloudflare services in that government space. And so, I think that that continues to be a place where we have very strong relationships. And as we continue to get the various certifications, it will allow us to go even faster. Yes, Alex. I think that. What we see is that the environment has gotten harder. And I think we saw the first signals of that actually going back to December of 2021, and they really started to manifest in various ways, slowdown of pipeline, slowdown of customers paying their bills in Q1 of this year. And we talked about that on the last quarter earnings call. And I think some people were questioning why would we do that? What I think we've been able to do, though, because we saw that, we acknowledged it. We didn't pretend like everything was normal, was really adjust to take advantage of the situation. And so, I think one of the real powers of Cloudflare's business is the diversity of our customer sets, both on a geography and also industry basis, the diversity of our products, and that allows us to have multiple levers to be able to continue to deliver even when the times get tough. And I think if you go back to the COVID quarters, and that was definitely a time where we had to adjust how we went to market, what we did, what types of customers are we focused on. We really transitioned from being a business-driven primarily from getting new logos to one that developed a real expertise in how to go to our existing customers and sell them more. And I think there are a lot of analogies that are similar to the sort of adjustments that we've made that allowed us to have a quarter like this. But make no mistake, we're still in what my grandmother would call, a tule fog. We've still got to go out and do the work every day of filling up the wheelbarrow with new leads, sifting through it to look for what's going to be the most promising and being able to deliver. But what I like about our business is, again, it's diversity across customer types, customer sizes, products, ways that we can go to market. And I think our team has done a good job of adapting to what is a much more difficult situation today than it was a year ago. Sure. I mean, I think that we have customers that are in that space, including a number of the large exchanges. But I don't think that there are any of them that would crack being a top 10 customer. And I think as a whole, I don't know the exact exposure, Thomas may be able to add to it. But I will say that it's not significant enough that it has been brought up as a big risk item internally. So, I think that we have always had -- I mean, I personally have never -- there's a lot of religion around the crypto space, where people are either hyperly pro crypto or hyperly against crypto. I feel like I'm the only kind of agnostic on crypto, where I don't think we have bet heavily on it. But at the same time, we've definitely made sure that if there are things that emerge from it, that we're in a position to take advantage of those. But that has not been a meaningful headwind to us. Sure. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, I think that it has gotten harder to sign up a new logo since the beginning of the year, but it's actually gotten easier to talk to our existing customers about using more of their platform -- more of our platforms in order to solve the problems that they have. And so, I think that that where we benefit is because we have such a broad product portfolio that allows us even in these times where signing up new logos is hard. We can go to our existing customers and have a conversation about how we can simplify their IT stack, how we can save them money, how we can make them more secure. And I think that that's attractive. So, we're still signing up plenty of new logos. But I think that on balance, it has definitely gotten harder to sign up new logos and it has gotten easier to have conversations about expanding usage of our platform and especially adopting different products that are part of our platform. In terms of what products are -- how the mix of products is changing, I think security continues to be top of mind that -- I think that there was real kind of concern around when the Russian invasion of Ukraine happened that there would be attacks that went out from Russia in retaliation against western companies. That actually did not materialize in Q1, the way I think a lot of people thought it would. But we started to see more of that start to materialize in Q2. It's still -- I wouldn't call it a trend yet, but we're seeing more companies come under attack and turning to us when that happens. And so, I think this is an environment where security products do very well. And across our security portfolio, we're seeing strength. Yes. So, we think of Cloudflare as stacking multiple adoption S curves one behind another. And so our first acts were how do we protect the infrastructure of customers around the world. And it is incredible to see how we've been able to do that successfully where today, more than 20% of all websites use our infrastructure. We're continuing to sell those products, but I think that where we are earlier in that S curve is with our Zero Trust products, and we're able to go to all of those people who adopted our application security products and now say, \"Hey, we can help you with Zero Trust as well.\" And I think that that is the big act that we're focusing on right now. Act three for us, which I think will really start to hit in a material way around revenue in three to five years is really around Workers. And I think we have been very pleasantly surprised how that adoption has happened faster and sooner and earlier than we expected. R2, which is our object store and our Amazon S3 competitor went into public beta last quarter, and we expect that it will go into GA right at the end of Q3. And so, I think that that's an opportunity for us to do more and we continue to invest in it. And again, we think that the real durable nature of Cloudflare is that we're able to continue to stack these acts one behind another behind another. Yes. I mean I think Morgan Stanley is a great Cloudflare customer, and we have a terrific relationship with the CIO team over there, and it's definitely an organization that has been willing to embrace change. And we -- I think that that's a big piece. And I think that most organizations today understand that they have to make that change, and they're very willing to have that conversation. I think the thing that has changed to some extent is even those organizations that thought they could continue to invest in on-premise hardware are finding the current situation very difficult, where if you want to get a new firewall today, the lead times can be 9 months before you get it. And at the same time, the firewall vendors are raising their prices. And so, I think that a lot of -- in the results, a lot of the sort of that RPO you saw in the traditional firewall vendors was people basically holding their place in line. But it's not a way to make customers happy, telling them they have to pay more and then delaying when the product is going to be there. And so even for some of the organizations that traditionally had said, \"We don't believe in the cloud or we don't believe in moving in this direction,\" I think that, that tune is starting to change, and it's becoming very much the minority opinion that you can solve these problems with on-premise hardware. Yes. I think that it really is for us about how we bundle products together. Today, 29% of the Fortune 1000 are already Cloudflare customers. If you fast forward with that, I think that a very significant percentage of the Fortune 1000 are going to be customers. And so, what we really want to focus on is how do we get them to use more of our platform. And what I think is unique about Cloudflare is we've already got the products in place where we can have those customers adopt our -- more and more our platform. There is not a single customer that uses every single feature of Cloudflare's platform today in terms of a contracted customer. And so, I think that's where we really see that growing. And I think that's a very healthy way to expand spend with customers is to become more and more critical. What we want to be is the network that the Fortune 1000 relies on for connecting to the internet, making sure that they're secure, making sure that their employees have the best experience possible and making sure that no matter what happens, they're always going to be online. Yes. So, when we sell our Zero Trust solutions, we really believe that the pieces all fit together. And so those are typically wins. Sometimes somebody will just -- will just adopt one portion of the solution, but we really like to sell that holistic solution and see how all of the pieces fit together. In terms of where we win, I think what we hear from the space is that our products are significantly more performant. We have a much more holistic solution where we can protect mobile devices in a way that a lot of the other providers can't. We can work across the geographies. When I was, this time last year, traveling in Africa using our products, they worked great, whereas most people in the space don't have that broad of a network that can deliver that. And I think that we are just able to scale much more significantly. We have literally two orders of magnitude, more capacity to be able to handle the forward proxy traffic across us than any of the other providers in the space. And I think that that's why we've been able to displace some companies that have used -- that have tried to adopt Zscaler and found it less user-friendly and that it generated a lot of IT support tickets. But that's really not our focus. Our focus is going after all of the on-premise firewalls and hardware and VPNs that exist in the universe. And so, I think they can be successful and we can be successful, but I think we have a better product. And over time, I think that will help us win. The Area 1 tech is amazing. So, the product, we're seeing really great wins from very large customers. And we think of that product as being a gateway to help with people on their Zero Trust journey. If you think about e-mail, the nature of it is it enumerates the employee directory of an organization, and it very much then helps us sell the other Zero Trust products that we have, and so that conversation is going well. It's also a conversation that is going well in terms of talking to our existing customers. It turns out everybody has got a phishing problem. It is for most of our customers, one click to sign up and test whether or not Area 1 can result in that. And so, we're seeing $1 million-plus wins that close in -- oftentimes in a matter of days or a short number of weeks, which is just -- because we can just prove how successful that is. I think beyond that, Area 1 has helped us in a number of other ways. One, as I mentioned earlier, is that they had a much more sophisticated channel program, which has now helped develop our channel program, and I think we're really thankful for that team being on board. And then, the third, which I think you'll hear us talk about more going forward is that they have a really world-class threat intelligence team. And that, I think, will turn into more products across our entire platform. And because I like you Brent, I'll let you have one more question. Yes, you got me in trouble with a lot of my peers at your conference, where I said that the economy was not as rosy as people think, and I think you've heard a lot of those folks echo those comments now in Q2. Let me be clear. I think that the economy is still in really rough shape. And I don't know -- and again, I'm not a member of the -- I'm not an economist. But from what we hear from customers, customers are really still suffering, And the economy, I wouldn't say that the economy itself has stabilized. What I would say is we have had the flexibility in our business to be able to adapt to a very difficult environment. That environment continues to be difficult, and I think it will be difficult at least through the rest of the year. But being able to deliver products that deliver real value, have an incredible ROI, can save customers' money and are must haves, not nice to haves, puts us in an incredibly powerful position. And as I said in the prepared remarks, I would not trade places with any other CEO. So, I'd like to, first of all, thank a bunch of the students from the Berklee School of Music to let us use some of their new and original songs for the hope music, going, going in. So, hopefully those of you who tuned in the call early, you appreciated that. I also want to thank the analysts for actually asking Thomas some questions this time. Usually, I get all the questions. Thanks to our team and all of our customers. We've got our hands on the wheel, our eyes on the road, and we'll see you all back here next quarter."

Before finishing up, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Investor Day next week on Thursday, May 12. It's being held in conjunction with our user conference, Cloudflare Connect, in New York City. This event will start at 9:00 a.m. Eastern and finish around 11:45, with a live webcast accessible from our Investor Relations website.  Additionally, we will be participating in the Jefferies Software Conference in San Francisco on June 1. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Jayson. We had a terrific quarter. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $212 million, up 54% year-over-year. We added a quarterly record of more than 14,000 new paying customers, up 10% quarter-over-quarter, bringing our total paying customer count to over 154,000. We add 121 new large customers, those that pay us over $100,000 per year, up 53% year-over-year to a total of 1,537. Today, 58% of our revenue comes from those large customers.  Our largest customers continue to get larger and larger. Those spending over $500,000 a year, growing 68% year-over-year, and those spending over $1 million a year, growing 72% year-over-year. We now have 12 customers and partners spending over $5 million per year with us. And yet, we remain highly diversified, with no customer representing more than 5% of revenue.  Our land and expand motion continues to improve, with dollar-based net retention hitting a new record of 127% in the quarter, up 400 basis points year-over-year. New products and an increased interest in consolidating behind a single trusted vendor for network services has been the key to our continued customer expansion.  Efficiency has always been a hallmark of our business. And even in these inflationary times, we achieved a gross margin in the quarter of 78.7%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. That continues to be above our target gross margin range of 75% to 77%, and affords us the opportunity to selectively target competitors' customers, offering them bundles of products that work seamlessly together, reducing the number of vendors they need and providing them with modern solutions, all while saving them money at the same time. We are finding this in a especially compelling value proposition when it seems everyone else is raising prices or can't even say for certain when they'll be able to deliver their legacy hardware boxes.  We closed our largest acquisition ever in the quarter, buying Area 1 Security for $162 million. We have a very high hurdle rate for acquisitions being strongly biased towards internal development but Area 1 technology and team are special. We started out as a customer. I remember shortly after we implemented their solution, writing to our Chief Security Officer to ask if something was wrong, I hadn't seen any phishing reports in a few weeks, where usually our team would report double digits per day. It turned out Area 1 and their incredible e-mail security tech was the answer. By the way, if you're still seeing phishing messages in your own box, tell your IT team to call us. We now have a great solution.  Over the last few years, the customer of Area 1, we got to know their team. At Cloudflare, we're a bunch of geeks. We're good at snipping out when tech is real and when it's BS. The Area 1 team shares the same spirit, so they were fun to work with, and their tech definitely isn't BS. We talked to them briefly about a partnership, but it became quickly clear and made far more sense for them to join Cloudflare and fully integrate with our zero trust suite.  Let me give you a sense of how that's going. We extended offers to all the Area 1 team, and even in this hot labor market, 98% of them chose to join Cloudflare. And I'm not giving up hope on that last one Area 1 team member who hasn't yet. I think that says something about how good it fit the 2 companies are together, the technologies and the culture.  E-mail is the #1 source of network threats that no leading zero trust vendor has truly integrated e-mail security is a major blind spot the industry was guilty of. As you see others in the space now scramble to build, buy or partner to fill the hole we pointed out in their offerings, know that it's the best signal that Cloudflare's zero trust solution is resonating in the market and taking share no matter what they may say. And good luck to them. We got the best team and the best tech in the business.  Let's talk about some customer wins in the quarter, starting with Area 1. In the second half of Q1, Cloudflare and Area 1 sales team started working together. We saw a number of customer wins from existing Cloudflare customers adding Area 1, as well as from Area 1 pipeline deals that accelerated after news broke of our acquisition. Practitioners trust Cloudflare, and know that if we buy a company, the tech works and will scale. New customers who onboarded to Area 1 in the quarter included a major Asian airline, a U.S. bulge bracket investment bank and a Fortune 1000 trucking company.  Let me dig into that trucking company example of it. They were an existing Cloudflare customer. They were in the midst of a pilot testing a wide range of e-mail security vendors. In those tests, Area 1 caught twice as many phishing e-mails as the next best competitor, that the tech was now part of Cloudflare made the decision a no-brainer. The trucking company signed a 7,500 seats, $385,000 2-year deal. Watch this space. There's going to be a lot more stories like this one.  We continue to see success with our other zero trust products. A Midwestern U.S. state bought 75,000 seats in a 3-year, $5.1 million deal. The state was replacing legacy hardware, and had decided to move to a cloud-based solution when they began talking to us. It was a competitive deal, but the preferred Cloudflare's tightly integrated approach that gave them a single pane of glass, with integrated policies and threat intelligence. They also love our performance and network that had presence inside their state borders. This was an example of the sale in partnership with a major systems integrator, which we expect will be part of more and more large zero trust sales.  We are confident our implementation of these products has plenty of margin to support a robust partner ecosystem.  A large Indian media platform chose Cloudflare over Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks for their zero trust network. They signed a $150,000 deal for 5,000 seats. They appreciated how much more tightly integrated our solutions were than the competition.  We are going head-to-head with Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks more and more, and we like our win rates when we do.  A European Fortune 500 automotive company adopted Cloudflare's zero trust approach to help manage their global fleet of more than 10 million vehicles. They signed a contract worth $320,000 per year. We're seeing more and more of these IoT zero trust use cases, and believe there is significant opportunity to expand with this customer.  Speaking of expansion, a Fortune 500 software company expanded their relationship with us, bringing their annual run rate to $15 million per year. The new contract expanded our relationship to another internal IT division. We're helping them build their future scalable, secure, modern network. They repeatedly let us know, we were the only vendor they trusted in the space for such a mission-critical service.  On the theme of trust, a large social network signed a $3 million, 5-year contract. They are using our global network to authenticate the security of one of their messaging products. They have built the authentication application on Workers, our serverless compute platform, that Workers can keep up with their tremendous scale and volume is a testament to its effortless scalability.  Sticking with Workers, a large Australian software company adopted Workers to help power a collaboration tool. They signed a $145,000 contracts. They're using Workers' durable object functionality to build real-time global synchronization into the product. What we're seeing with Workers is that there's a natural expansion as smart software teams realize what they can do when they can write code and effectively deploy it directly into the Internet fabric. We expect this customer will continue to use Workers for more of their projects now that they've proven success with this one.  A Fortune 500 health care company signed a $1.2 million, 3-year deal. It's a pretty standard network security and performance use case for us, replacing legacy hardware. What I thought was interesting with that the IT team had moved from a large financial services customer of ours. As they change jobs, they brought Cloudflare to their new employer. I think we're going to see a lot more of this as practitioners have succeeded in their last job by leaning on us are moving on and moving up in their careers to new opportunities.  A Fortune 500 financial services company went all in on Cloudflare. They said that they see us as the future. They signed a 1.5 million, 3-year deal. It was driven by their Chief Security Officer. From start to finish, the sales cycle was around 4 months. They ripped out a number of legacy vendors and consolidated a number of network services behind us. They were tired of trying to find best-of-breed with every product, and instead ending, up with a Frankenstein map. They realized they could with us have the best-of-breed network that was tightly integrated with the features all efficient work together. We expect they will continue to grow their contracts now that they brought fully into Cloudflare architecture.  One last story. A Fortune 1000 gaming company signed a $3.3 million, 3-year contract. I love this story. They were using AWS, but found their security couldn't prevent the attacks they were seeing. After struggling to keep their application online, AWS's team eventually told them, \"You should just use Cloudflare.\" And so they did. [indiscernible] that let them and lots of other customers know that R2 is progressing to open beta next week, and we expect we'll be able to save them lots of AWS egress fees as well.  I wanted to close by talking about what we're seeing in Russia and Ukraine. I mentioned the region at the end of the last earnings call. A number of you reached out to say a theme out of place at the time. Unfortunately, it proved pressure. At Cloudflare, our global network serves as an early warning sensor for what's happening across the Internet.  In the month leading up to Russes and Basin, we saw characteristics cyber probing and other warning signs that were similar to what we've seen in Georgia and Crimea years earlier. Concerned, we've briefed Western government and offered our services to critical infrastructure providers and government institutions in Ukraine well before the physical invasion began. Many organizations there took us up on our offer of protection.  One of the stories of the war has been the relative lack of cyberattacks. That's not exactly accurate. There have been attacks. However, the number that have been successful are thankfully few. I'm proud of the role that Cloudflare has played to that end.  In Russia, Belarus and the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, we terminated all users tied to sanction parties and put additional checks in place for new customers signing up for our services. The region, including Ukraine, represents less than 1% of revenue. So we do not anticipate meaningful financial impact to our business, but we are conservatively reserving for the worst case, just like we did at the beginning of COVID.  One surprising thing that happened in the quarter was that our 1.1.1.1 app rose to #1 in the Russian app stores. We build that app and give it away to consumers for free as the world's largest test bed for a key component of our zero trust solution. It turned out in what was an increasingly thoughtful network environment inside Russia. Citizens there wanting to see what was really going on, installed the app in order to access Western media. Now we won't make any money on this. So some of you may wonder why am I telling you about it during the earnings call. Because it turns out doing the right thing and being there when some on the Internet needs us has always been core to Cloudflare and has always turned out to be good business for us over the long term. It's why I love my job. Successfully operating inside the hostile network environment that is Russia today makes our mobile app better for our enterprise zero trust customers. Ensuring Ukrainian critical infrastructure stays online means we can stand up to the biggest nation state-sponsored attacks for our largest government, financial services and other off-targeted customers, and briefing government on what's about to happen proves the power and unique insight we get from our global network.  We're in the trust business. We always have been. And in Q1, we built a lot of trust in a lot of quarters. Even in what I believe will prove to have been the hardest quarter for the industry since Q1 of 2020, trust is the secret to why we continue to grow paying customers in a record pace. It's why we received 133,000 job applications and saw attrition actually ticked down, while many others are struggling to hire. And while we continue to have a seat at the table in conversations around the future regulation of the Internet alongside today's check giants.  We will be there as the Internet needs us in Ukraine, Russia and everywhere else. And as we are, we are sowing the seeds to build what we intend to become not just what some of you may think of a SaaS, a steady, efficient, fast-growing SaaS company today, but an iconic trusted technology company that will define the future of the Internet for decades to come.  With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas to dive into our steady, efficient fast-growing numbers. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We continued the momentum from the fourth quarter and delivered a strong Q1, exceeding the high end of our revenue guidance with strength in multiple areas of the business. Turning to revenue.  Total revenue for the first quarter increased 54% year-over-year to $212.2 million. The growth in revenue was driven by strong adoption of our product portfolio and continued traction with our enterprise customer base.  From a geographic perspective, in Q1, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 56% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 57% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 31% year-over-year.  We are pleased to see growth continue to accelerate in APAC and see EMEA repeat as our highest growth geography this quarter.  Turning to customer metrics. We exited the quarter with 154,109 paying customers, representing an increase of 29% year-over-year. We ended the year with 1,537 large customers, representing an increase of 63% year-over-year or an addition of 121 large customers in the quarter.  We were pleased to see large customer revenue contribution increase again sequentially. Significant expansion from our large customers contributed to a record dollar-based net retention rate of 127%, representing an increase of 200 basis points sequentially. We continue to see broad-based strength across our enterprise go-to-market efforts, which we look forward to providing additional insights during our Investor Day next week.  Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 78.7%, consistent with last quarter. Network CapEx represented 9% of revenue in the first quarter. Going forward, we expect to see some level of quarter-to-quarter variability given strategic purchase decisions and continue to expect network CapEx to be 12% to 14% of revenue for fiscal 2022.  Turning to operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and decreased 7% year-over-year to 76%. We had another strong hiring quarter where we saw our total number of employees increased 42% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to approximately 2,750 at the end of the quarter.  Sales and marketing expenses were $89.7 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and decreased to 42% from 46% in the same quarter last year.  Research and development expenses were $40.3 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue stayed flat sequentially and decreased to 19% from 21% in the same quarter last year. G&A expenses were $32 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 15% from 17% in the same quarter last year.  We saw continued operating leverage strength in the first quarter with operating margin improving 770 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was $4.9 million compared to an operating loss of $7.5 million in the same period last year. Q1 was our third consecutive quarter of achieving operating profit. And as a reminder, we intend to grow our operating expenses in line with the revenue staying here or at breakeven and reinvest excess profitability back into the business to address the enormous opportunity in front of us.  Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $3.5 million or net income per share of $0.01. Tax expense for the first quarter was $1.7 million. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $64.4 million or 30% of revenue compared to negative $2.2 million or 2% of revenue in the same period last year.  Operating cash flow was negative $35.5 million in the first quarter or 70% of revenue, compared to $23.5 million or 17% of revenue in the same period last year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily related to a unique withholding tax payment of approximately $30 million.  As mentioned last quarter, we expected to see some cash flow variability in the first half of 2022, but we continue to expect to return to positive free cash flow in the second half of this year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $688 million, representing an increase of 10% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. Current RPO was 76% of total RPO.  Turning to guidance. As Matthew mentioned, we closed the Area 1 acquisition on April 1, which is expected to contribute less than 1% to revenue and the dilutive impact on profitability is reflected in guidance in both the second quarter and full year. Additionally, in the first quarter, we also ended all relationships with users tied to sanction parties in Russia, which represented less than a 1% impact to revenue.  For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $126.5 million to $227.5 million, representing an increase of 49% year-over-year. We expect an operating loss, including Area 1, in the range of $2 million to $1 million. We expect a net loss per share of $0.01 to breakeven.  For modeling purposes, please note that if we report positive net income in the second quarter, we expect our share count to be 344 million fully diluted share for the 325 million basic shares if we report a net loss. We expect a tax expense of $1.8 million.  For the full year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $955 million to $959 million, representing an increase of 45% to 46% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $10 million to $14 million, and we expect net income per share over that period in the range of $0.03 to $0.04, assuming approximately 345 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $7.7 million.  In closing, it was another very strong quarter. I, again, want to thank our employees for delivering these great results and for their continued dedication. We look forward to hosting our second Investor Day next Thursday, where we'll do a deeper dive on our product portfolio and recent acquisitions as well as updates on our financial progress and market opportunity.  And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Dan Berger for Matt Hedberg. Say, dollar-based net retention continues to track well, the 127% was really nice to see, obviously having success with large customer expansion. Maybe a little more, if you could, and what is it that gets customers to buy into the broader set of the platform? And what really gets those enterprise customers to the next level of usage?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. I think that what we have seen is that once the customer is on our network, we can see traffic across their systems typically and make intelligent recommendations over what additional products. So I'll give you a specific example. We're -- we have an incredible bot management product that is good at stopping malicious automated traffic on a customer's site. One of the things we do is even before someone is using the bond management product, we can look at their traffic patterns, see how many bots they have and then generate a report for them that says, \"You have a bot problem. Here's what we see. Would you like us to help you with it?\"  And so I think that those sorts of intelligent recommendations have been very good at getting customers to adopt additional products on our platform. I think going forward, as we've talked about in previous earnings calls, what you'll see us do more and more is bundle together our services into much broader licenses. And so you can see that with even some of the examples that I brought up on the prepared remarks earlier, where companies that buy into our total infrastructure commit to a certain spend with us, and then they are able to just continuously add additional products, and we true that up on an annual basis.  I think we are really unique in that we have that broad set of different products, where once you're using our service, we can start making intelligent recommendations, and we can solve so many problems for customers that those sort of site-wide licenses make sense. And I think that, that will continue to be a big piece of our growth going forward.\nThomas Seifert: I wanted to add to that tie back to the incredible innovation engine that you should keep in mind, too. Not only the expansion working, but there are more products and features available to sell every quarter. That plays into our D&R strategy moving forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very helpful from both of you. And then new customer generation, really robust in the quarter, a record, as you mentioned. Anything worth pointing out there as a driver or accounting for that strong new customer number?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I don't mean to critique your work, but your early note that went out suggested that we now have 14,000 customers. In fact, we actually added 14,000 new customers in the quarter, paying customers in the quarter, and are now at over 150,000 paying customers across the platform. I think that, that again is just us showing that across regardless of the size of customer, we've been able to very effectively get them onto our platform, nurture them over time, get them to use additional products and services and grow them into larger and larger customers.  And so I think it's -- at some level, when you look at growth like that, there's never one particular thing that you can point to and say, \"That was what was going on.\" Because, again, we service such a broad set of customers from very small to very, very large. But I'm really proud of the team and the hard work that they've done in order to deliver in continuing to grow our entire customer base. And that's -- and it's great to see us have a record add of 14,000 new customers in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist.\nJoel Fishbein: Fantastic execution again. Matthew, a couple of other companies that are cloud-centric have reported that Internet traffic has been trending down over the past several months. I'd love to just get your take on what's happening and how Cloudflare is positioned and how your Internet traffic has been flowing.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. We haven't seen that. I think it has been continued growth. So to, first of all, answer your question, just straight up, we said year-over-year traffic growth across our network of 75.8%, quarter-over-quarter growth of 15.9%, and that's in line with sort of the quarter-over-quarter growth that we've seen for the last period.  It's worth remembering that we don't bill primarily based on usage. We bill in a much more predictable way. And so I think that, that is a good indication that we are taking share from the rest of the industry.  But even in the post-COVID times, the traffic across our network continues to grow. And we do that while still maintaining above what our target gross margins are. I think the other thing which you didn't ask about, but I think it's interesting to compare, is how much usage has grown across our network. And where bandwidth has grown 75.8% year-over-year, CPU usage has actually grown 89.1%. And over the quarter, it's 15.9% for bandwidth and 21.8% growth for CPU usage.  What I think is -- why that's interesting and that's important, because I think that that's actually showing where people are not just using Cloudflare for moving bits around, but they're using Cloudflare in order to do intelligent processing of those bits, and that intelligence, which is really driven by like our Workers' edge computing product, as well as some of our security products, that's actually growing faster than bandwidth. And I think that, that delta shows why we're able to continue to grow revenue at the 54% that we did in the quarter. Does that answer your question?\nJoel Fishbein: More than I wanted, but thank you. That was great. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Matthew, the Area 1 acquisition, I think, is a unique one for you and kind of maybe outside your core lane that you've gone. Can you just talk to that? And then Also, when you think about the go-to-market and the synergies among the other suite, can you just talk through how you think that unveils over the next several quarters?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think -- so first of all, any acquisition is a bit unusual for us because we have such a strong bias towards internal development and building products ourselves. I think though, Area 1 and e-mail security, in particular, makes just a ton of sense for us to do something around. If you look across every other protocol that is sent across the Internet, we protect whether it's HDB traffic or it's your SIP traffic to your phone system or it's SSH traffic, anything that's out there, any protocol, we protect. And we had just not dived into protecting SMTP and the e-mail protocols.  And I think a little bit of that is, honestly, my fault and our CTO john's fault, because both of us had worked in e-mail security prior to come to Cloudflare. And I think we have the scar tissue to prove from it. And so all the time, our sales team would come to us and say, \"Hey, customers really would love us to have an e-mail security product.\" Our engineering team would say, \"We have a ton of data that could help inform an e-mail security product. We should build it.\" And I think John and I would often veto that. I think that, that, frankly, was a blind spot on both of our sites. Because if you look at the data, e-mail security is by far the #1 source of threats that come into an organization. Almost every headline hacking incident that you've read about in the last 2 years, e-mail was the initial way that, that vulnerability was taken into account.  So I think it makes a ton of sense for us to have a solution. It's also incredibly powerful because we're the DNS provider that we can make it one-click deployment, where it's a customer of ours clicks a single button and instantly, they get the benefits of the Area 1 solution, and they can continue to use whoever their existing e-mail provider is, whether that's Outlook and Microsoft Office or its G-suite or if it's something that they're hosting on-premise. Much like Cloudflare, Area 1 is a proxy, but it's just a proxy for e-mail traffic.  So I think it's a very natural point for us to integrate. I think, it's a very easy sales motion for our customers to go through. And to the second part of your question, I think it integrates with the rest of our zero trust suite extremely well. So for instance, when you get an e-mail from an unknown sender, we can automatically isolate that e-mail using our browser isolation product so that any link that you click on in that link don't actually render on your laptop, but they're actually rendered at the edge of our network. So any malicious content that's in those links, we can stop.  And so I think that this is going to be a very effective way to introduce our zero trust suite to the market. It gets people to start to adopt a seat-based approach to our product very easy for our existing customers to deploy with 1 click. And I think it's going to be a gateway to the rest of our zero trust product, selling more of our gateway and access and browser isolation products as well. Does that answer your question?\nBrent Thill: That was very comprehensive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Nice quarter there. I wanted to hear a little bit more about the wave 2 products like Teams and Magic Transit, Match Plan are doing, especially as it seems like these are driving the largest dollar growth still. Additionally, how has Cloudflare for Offices progress this quarter? And is there any way to think of how many customers are a penetration rate of using some of these wave 2 solutions that I'm talking about here?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So I think that the wave 2 solutions, and I would characterize it a little bit differently. I would say that we have products like Magic Transit, Magic Firewall, that really do complement some of our more traditional products. They're all about protecting content, protecting your infrastructure. And then we have products like Gateway and Access and Browser Isolation, which are all about protecting users.  And so I think you pumped those sort of into wave 2. And that's true from a timing perspective, but they actually are slightly different and they -- and I think that they are both growing very well. But they are somewhat different in terms of the way that we go to market with those products. And in some cases, who the exact buyer is within an organization for those products.  And so I think we've seen really strong adoption for the Magic Transit product. That is replacing a lot of the traditional network DDoS protection services. I think particular strength in carriers that are starting to use the product as well, which I think -- which is a really exciting opportunity. And it's -- we're getting that because of the fact that we can just stand in front of much more traffic than possible -- as possible through any sort of box-based solution.  I think on the user-based products, we're seeing really good adoption of those, both for customers who are coming first for those products but then also for us to be able to sell those products to our existing customers. And there's a really natural extension between our traditional firewall products and the access product, and those dovetail very well together.  I think Cloudflare for Offices continues to progress really well, although it's very early in terms of what that will look like. We have, in the quarter, we announced some of the hardware that we are deploying, and we are starting to build that out within networks. I would say that rather than that us measuring the success of that product today based on the revenue that it generates, I think we are much more measuring the success of that product based on the willingness of landlords and network providers to invite us into their facilities and allow us to directly interconnect. And I think that, that is in every region where we've deployed the Cloudflare for Offices. That is trending at or ahead of what our expectations are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Congrats on another great quarter. I wanted to focus in on Workers and R2. You talked about some pretty significant wins there, Matthew. One of the things you've also talked about, too, is how sort of it takes a long time to sort of get escape velocity and a platform in terms of developer adoption, et cetera. How are you thinking about sort of where we stand right now? And is there anything sort of surprising you in sort of the rate and pace of adoption of Workers or just sort of call it the broader platform when you think about R2?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. So first of all, as I mentioned, R2 is going to progress from a closed beta to an open beta next week. And next week, we have Platform Week, which is really very much focused on all of the different ways that Cloudflare can be a platform for developers to develop on, but really a focus around the various Workers' products. And I think we'll have some very exciting surprises as part of what we're rolling out over the course of the week as well.  I think that if you study developer platforms, for them to really reach escape velocity, takes between 8 and 12 years. And so Workers was launched in late 2017, so we're continuing to develop it. We're on that curve. I think the thing that has surprised me is that we're seeing very big companies with very sophisticated development teams getting excited about and realizing that Workers is a solution for a lot of the problems they have.  The 2 examples that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one major social network, that's a very sophisticated developer team that chose to build using Workers. And I think what we found is that once a team like that sees the power of what they can do with Workers, that really excites them, both within the organization they're at and also as they change jobs and go to other places where they take the technology with them. The same thing is true with the Australian software company, where doing something like real-time collaboration across multiple continents, if you're trying to do that with a traditional public cloud, it's a ton of work. With durable objects and Workers, it almost just works out of the box. And in fact, we have examples of how that's done. And I think that, that was something that was, again, incredibly well-received by that very sophisticated software engineering team, and we expect that they will continue to do more with the product.  So I think, again, it's going to be some time before it's something that we would -- that is dramatically contributing to revenue. But I am very pleasantly surprised at how many developers are flocking to the workers ecosystem, and we'll be talking a lot more about it next week.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Matt Wilson on for Keith Weiss. Matt, you again mentioned the opportunity to use gross margins as a weapon against customers who -- or against competitors who are more vulnerable to pricing and cost pressures. Can you detail what has allowed Cloudflare to resist these pressures, both on the pricing and cost front?\nMatthew Prince: I think efficiency is just at our core. And so our network has always been designed in such a way to be able to get to be as efficient as possible. And so that has allowed us to deliver the services that we do. I think we sometimes get compared with some of the more traditional CDN-type vendors, and that's just never how we have seen ourselves, and it's not business that we have chased.  And so I think that where, if you're selling just bit delivery, it turns out that being a little bit faster -- really the returns are incredibly diminishing. Whereas if you're selling security, if you're selling intelligence, which is built into the network, if you're selling the ability to drive that, that has a very compelling use case.  I think from the beginning, we also always said that Cloudflare, one of the first tenants of Cloudflare was never lose on price. And I think that forced us to be efficient from the beginning. And so customers, I think, in this time where everyone is looking for ways to figure out how they can save money on their IT budgets and where many other vendors are trying to figure out how they can either hold or raise prices, I think we can continue to be pushing forward and taking share and especially taking that high-margin share from both existing hardware vendors who are having a hard time even delivering their products, as well as other cloud vendors that, again, I think are not as efficient as we've been.  So I think that's been key to our story since the earliest days. It will continue to be key to our story. And I think it's that efficiency is a hallmark of who we are at Cloudflare.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thank you for those details. And maybe on this one for Thomas. When can we kind of expect this gross margin strategy to show off in the numbers.\nThomas Seifert: I'm not sure what you mean by showing up in the numbers. I think that we have been able to digest the significant revenue growth that we have been able to digest the significant traffic growth that Matthew just alluded to, and been able to scale at a flat to up gross margin, I think is already a testament to the elasticity of the network.  And I just want to reiterate that because I think that is our -- one of our competitive mote, the ability that all products are running on every server in every city. And because of that, the complete network service, are your decrease of freedom to manage cost and demand and supply every server that we add, every city that we add regardless of where in the world at decrease of freedom to manage the flexibility and the elasticity of this network.  So I think you see that already today. We've seen tremendous growth product-wise, revenue-wise, traffic-wise, every metric that you look at that would measure that and have been able to digest that in stable to slightly up gross margins. I think it's already a testament to that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Breen with William Blair.\nJames Breen: Just sort of on that point a little bit. So are you basically sort of managing to kind of a breakeven non-GAAP operating income line, plus or minus a couple of million here just to maximize the revenue?  And then just from an expansion standpoint. As you build out more network, more point of presence, does that enable you to go deeper into some of the multinationals that right now maybe you don't have access to because of that?\nMatthew Prince: Sure, Jim. So I think that we've been very consistent at saying that we are going to hold as close to breakeven on our operating margin as we can. I said on a previous call that if we showed massively positive earnings per share, that would mean something that we did something wrong because if we can continue to grow at the rates that we're guiding towards, there's nowhere else we should be putting that money other than back into the business to grow the business as quickly as possible.  And so I think that we are doing that, we've been very consistent in delivering that message. I don't think there's anything that has changed about that strategy. And again, I think we're managing towards a breakeven on operating margin.  In terms of the POPs, I think that -- I mean, we're already in well over 100 countries around the world. I think that when multinationals look to us, it's not our POP presence that has ever been -- certainly since we went public, standing in the way of them adopting us. And I think that if you look at the companies that we're highlighting in some of the examples, these are almost all massive, multinational companies that rely on our network, and think that it's the case.  I think the thing which is powerful about as we build out more POPs is that counterintuitively, because of the design of our network and because of the efficiency of our network that both Thomas and I just alluded to, it actually drives our cost down over time rather than driving it up. It takes a certain amount of servers in order to process a certain number of requests. So your CapEx is actually driven by the amount of usage of your service more than anything else.  What is powerful is because we have done the hard work on the networking and software side to make it so that any server, anywhere can handle any request, that means that as we continue to expand our network out that we're able to directly interconnect with the various ISPs and eyeball networks around the world and drive our cost down for things like bandwidth, co-location and other variable costs that are part of our business.  And so I think that, that's decomposing a little bit what the reason for our ability to continue to expand. And if in the future we need the darn snorkels and dive to the bottom of the ocean in order because we can get more efficiency in our network by putting a pop somewhere there, we are going to continue to do whatever is necessary to be able to deliver our services as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg with Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Maybe just for Matthew on the federal vertical. I just hoping you could provide an update just on fed ramp and the opportunities that you see. Obviously, you've seen some traction there with the joint win with Accenture, but just curious how you're thinking about the federal opportunity in 2022 more broadly.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Federal is a big opportunity for us. [indiscernible] we think we'll continue to unlock that. We got word actually today that we have thumbs up from our sponsoring agency and are just waiting kind of in line with the overall federal agency to get that approved. So we think that's all going well. We've done everything that we can do, and it's a little bit like being at the DMV. You've got to kind of just wait for your number to get called. But we're confident that it will get called hopefully sooner than later. And if anyone federal DMV is listening in, there's a lot of agencies that want to use us. So hopefully, we can meet that requirement.  That is not holding us back from working with Accenture as well as other partners, and we've continued to see significant interest. I think the thing that I would come back to is the amount of trust that we have built in the sort of C-level equivalent of the federal government. The number of calls that our team, and including myself, have received from the people who are really trusted with securing the U.S. infrastructure, to understand what's going on in Ukraine, to ask us for help, protecting the infrastructure in the United States, I think that, that speaks incredibly well of us.  We actually launched, in partnership with CrowdStrike, as well as Ping Identity, in the quarter the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act. I was really honored by the White House is stepping up and saying that, that was something that they recommended any hospitals, utilities, or energy companies adopt as quickly as possible. So I think that we have an enormous amount of goodwill within the government. I think we are moving forward and think that there is an enormous opportunity to continue to deliver on that goodwill. And any day now, hopefully, the FedRAMP DMV will call our number, and we'll be able to announce that. That process is formally behind us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham.\nAlexander Henderson: First off, I wanted to really compliment you guys on what a great job you've done protecting both the Ukrainian infrastructure, as well as the reporters that needed there and continuing to deliver access to Western news flow into Russia. It's really important stuff.  The question I wanted to ask was really around the Internet traffic question asked earlier. And maybe you could give us a couple of data points on the change in your coding total. But the traffic, obviously, up 75%, is well ahead of the growth in the marketplace, which I think is around 30%. So can you update us on where you are in terms of what percentage of Internet traffic you're carrying?  And second, along the same lines, it's my understanding that API traffic has more than doubled over the last 18 months in terms of its rate of growth, from over 150% to something in excess of 300%, which ultimately suggests that there's very high rates of growth in the domain, the domain and domain to user traffic, which is obviously a key part of what you guys do, protecting and optimizing and accelerating that traffic. So can you talk to us a little bit about where you are on the statistics in terms of share? And what the implication of that API growth rate is? I realize you're not being paid per bit, but rather that would imply very rapid acceleration in the number of domains that are being traffic, too.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Alex, first of all, thank you for the kudos at the beginning. It's been a quarter where a lot of our team has been working tireless nights to make sure that as much of the Ukrainian infrastructure stays online and that services like 1.1.1.1 continue to allow people in parts of the world where they may not have free access to the Internet for them to be able to see what's happening. And I think that, that that's something that I'm really proud of our team to have done, and I appreciate you calling it out.  In terms of Cloudflare's percentage of Internet traffic, I think it's -- we don't really -- we know what our numerator is, but we don't know what the denominator is. And I don't think there's a good source of that. I think that we look at some proxies for that in other places. One is what percentage of the top million websites are behind us. And that number is around 20% today. I think what that underrepresents is a lot of our other products. It doesn't take into account products like our zero trust products, it doesn't take into account things like Magic Transit and other products.  But from a just pure what percentage of the web uses Cloudflare on, if you measure that using third-party sources, it's right around 20%. For API, I think that, that has been a trend that we've seen for quite some time, more and more of the traffic that passes through Cloudflare, its API traffic. In the quarter, we announced our updated API protection suite. We've seen really great adoption for that. Again, I think it's one of the things where it's all sort of the same protocols, but being able to understand that this is an API, validate that API, help developers really make sure that the schema that is being sent to and from that API is correct. Those are all things that our network is very good at delivering, and we're seeing strong customer interest and strong customer growth from that.  And the last thing I'd say is that Workers is a big -- there is no easier way to build an API today than on Workers. And I think that next week, during Platform Week, we're going to have a bunch of examples of customers and companies and developers that are doing exactly that. And I think that that's going to be a bigger and bigger piece of the Workers story going forward.\nAlexander Henderson: If I could just throw 1 additional question in India and China. Can you give us an update on why that traffic isn't reaccelerating at a faster rate? And when it will start to eclipse the company averages?\nMatthew Prince: So I don't think we've broken out the traffic from India and China, and I don't know precisely what the growth rates are.\nAlexander Henderson: Yes, that was a revenue question, Matt.\nMatthew Prince: From a revenue perspective. So again, I think that those are both regions that are interesting to us. They're very different from one another. I think that we have seen a lot of success selling into the Indian market and been able to continue to expand our services there. And we've done a great job at both selling to customers, as well as finding ways to interconnect with what is a very complicated ISP model in India.  In China, we've always worked with partners. And so we have been a long-time partner with Baidu. We are a more recent partner with JD Cloud. And I think that in both -- in that case, that partnership is going extremely well. And again, it is complicated for any Western company to be operating in China. And so the fact that we have now been doing so since 2015, I think shows -- that shows the power of what we've been able to deliver.  Also, it's not always the purpose that we're trying to generate revenue from inside of China. The value of us having a network that extends into China is at least in equal part, if not greater, that we can form multinational companies that you can with 1 single network, deliver services to every country on earth, including inside of China. And I think that, that is unique for us to be able to do that and have the same features and functionality largely there that we have around the rest of the world. So I think both of those are markets at have their own complications, but we continue to operate in and see success.\nJayson Noland: Operator, can we take 1 more question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. I guess I have 2 as well. I'll ask them at the same time. First off, I was hoping you could just talk about this growing concern of a recession in Europe and in America. So in that context, are you seeing any shift in your customers' buying patterns or deal closing rates or anything? Just any impact from risk of recession to how your sales team is operating?  And then if you can also just clarify, from an M&A perspective, how is that embedded into your revenue and operating profit guide for June quarter? What is the impact from the deals, if you may?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. I'll take the first question, and then Thomas can close out with the second. As I said, I think that this will -- when the history books are written, turn out to be the most complicated quarter that tech companies have lived through, certainly since Q1 of 2020. And I think that there is real risk of a recession going forward. And even aside from that, I think that there is definitely we're all seeing the inflationary environment and the concerns around that.  What I like, though, is I can't imagine a company that is better positioned for a situation like that than we are. We're offering a service which is not a nice to have, but a must-have. We're offering a service in a way which saves customers money over what their existing solutions are. We've deployed the network in such a way that we can make sure that we service customers as we need them. And so what we saw in the quarter was definitely fires concern over what was going on in the world. But in many cases, that was actually having them come to us.  And so I think that as there are challenging economic times, we are extremely well positioned to provide what are critical services to make sure the Internet continues to work. And to me, it feels a lot like the beginning of COVID, where I think there's a lot of concern that's out there. But over time, what we find is, time and time and time again, customers are turning to us, saying we want to consolidate our spend from instead of spending across 10 different vendors, we want to put it all behind you. They like the fact that we have that bundled integrated approach, and they like the fact that we're able to save them money over what their legacy solutions are that are in place.  So I think that, that positions us very well for what may be -- what was -- what I think was already a challenging quarter for many companies. and I think it might be a challenging period for companies over the next period to come.\nThomas Seifert: And addressing your guidance question, I think we followed our standard approach of trying to be thoughtful and prudent when it came to the exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. So we already mentioned that we -- that was a less than 1% headwind revenue in the first quarter, and we reflected this also in the guidance we issued for the current quarter and for the rest of the year.  And as I said in the prepared remarks, the acquisition of Area 1 is also reflected in guidance, both for the second quarter as well as for the full year. And that is true both for revenue, but less than 1% contribution for the year. But it's also true for the dilutive impact on profitability. So all are reflected in the guidance we gave.\nOperator: That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to CEO, Matthew Prince, for closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: This has been a challenging quarter as we've watched what world events have taken place. I'm incredibly proud of our team for having made sure that the Ukrainian infrastructure stayed online, that the people in the world could see what was really happening and providing a network with Cloudflare that really can stand up to any challenge that's ahead.  I really appreciate all the work of all of the Cloudflare employees. I appreciate all of our customers. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day and our Customer Day, which is next week in New York, and stay tuned for a lot of announcements. It's going to be a busy week for us, because it's also Platform Week, which is one of our Innovation Weeks, and we're expecting to announce a number of really great features. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We continued the momentum from the fourth quarter and delivered a strong Q1, exceeding the high end of our revenue guidance with strength in multiple areas of the business. Turning to revenue.  Total revenue for the first quarter increased 54% year-over-year to $212.2 million. The growth in revenue was driven by strong adoption of our product portfolio and continued traction with our enterprise customer base.  From a geographic perspective, in Q1, we saw continued strength in both the U.S. and internationally. The U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 56% year-over-year. EMEA represented 26% of revenue and increased 57% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 31% year-over-year.  We are pleased to see growth continue to accelerate in APAC and see EMEA repeat as our highest growth geography this quarter.  Turning to customer metrics. We exited the quarter with 154,109 paying customers, representing an increase of 29% year-over-year. We ended the year with 1,537 large customers, representing an increase of 63% year-over-year or an addition of 121 large customers in the quarter.  We were pleased to see large customer revenue contribution increase again sequentially. Significant expansion from our large customers contributed to a record dollar-based net retention rate of 127%, representing an increase of 200 basis points sequentially. We continue to see broad-based strength across our enterprise go-to-market efforts, which we look forward to providing additional insights during our Investor Day next week.  Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 78.7%, consistent with last quarter. Network CapEx represented 9% of revenue in the first quarter. Going forward, we expect to see some level of quarter-to-quarter variability given strategic purchase decisions and continue to expect network CapEx to be 12% to 14% of revenue for fiscal 2022.  Turning to operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and decreased 7% year-over-year to 76%. We had another strong hiring quarter where we saw our total number of employees increased 42% year-over-year, bringing our total number of employees to approximately 2,750 at the end of the quarter.  Sales and marketing expenses were $89.7 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 2% sequentially and decreased to 42% from 46% in the same quarter last year.  Research and development expenses were $40.3 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue stayed flat sequentially and decreased to 19% from 21% in the same quarter last year. G&A expenses were $32 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 15% from 17% in the same quarter last year.  We saw continued operating leverage strength in the first quarter with operating margin improving 770 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was $4.9 million compared to an operating loss of $7.5 million in the same period last year. Q1 was our third consecutive quarter of achieving operating profit. And as a reminder, we intend to grow our operating expenses in line with the revenue staying here or at breakeven and reinvest excess profitability back into the business to address the enormous opportunity in front of us.  Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $3.5 million or net income per share of $0.01. Tax expense for the first quarter was $1.7 million. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was negative $64.4 million or 30% of revenue compared to negative $2.2 million or 2% of revenue in the same period last year.  Operating cash flow was negative $35.5 million in the first quarter or 70% of revenue, compared to $23.5 million or 17% of revenue in the same period last year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily related to a unique withholding tax payment of approximately $30 million.  As mentioned last quarter, we expected to see some cash flow variability in the first half of 2022, but we continue to expect to return to positive free cash flow in the second half of this year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $688 million, representing an increase of 10% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. Current RPO was 76% of total RPO.  Turning to guidance. As Matthew mentioned, we closed the Area 1 acquisition on April 1, which is expected to contribute less than 1% to revenue and the dilutive impact on profitability is reflected in guidance in both the second quarter and full year. Additionally, in the first quarter, we also ended all relationships with users tied to sanction parties in Russia, which represented less than a 1% impact to revenue.  For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $126.5 million to $227.5 million, representing an increase of 49% year-over-year. We expect an operating loss, including Area 1, in the range of $2 million to $1 million. We expect a net loss per share of $0.01 to breakeven.  For modeling purposes, please note that if we report positive net income in the second quarter, we expect our share count to be 344 million fully diluted share for the 325 million basic shares if we report a net loss. We expect a tax expense of $1.8 million.  For the full year 2022, we expect revenue in the range of $955 million to $959 million, representing an increase of 45% to 46% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $10 million to $14 million, and we expect net income per share over that period in the range of $0.03 to $0.04, assuming approximately 345 million common shares outstanding. We expect a tax expense of $7.7 million.  In closing, it was another very strong quarter. I, again, want to thank our employees for delivering these great results and for their continued dedication. We look forward to hosting our second Investor Day next Thursday, where we'll do a deeper dive on our product portfolio and recent acquisitions as well as updates on our financial progress and market opportunity.  And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. I wanted to add to that tie back to the incredible innovation engine that you should keep in mind, too. Not only the expansion working, but there are more products and features available to sell every quarter. That plays into our D&R strategy moving forward. I'm not sure what you mean by showing up in the numbers. I think that we have been able to digest the significant revenue growth that we have been able to digest the significant traffic growth that Matthew just alluded to, and been able to scale at a flat to up gross margin, I think is already a testament to the elasticity of the network.  And I just want to reiterate that because I think that is our -- one of our competitive mote, the ability that all products are running on every server in every city. And because of that, the complete network service, are your decrease of freedom to manage cost and demand and supply every server that we add, every city that we add regardless of where in the world at decrease of freedom to manage the flexibility and the elasticity of this network.  So I think you see that already today. We've seen tremendous growth product-wise, revenue-wise, traffic-wise, every metric that you look at that would measure that and have been able to digest that in stable to slightly up gross margins. I think it's already a testament to that. And addressing your guidance question, I think we followed our standard approach of trying to be thoughtful and prudent when it came to the exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.

And that is true both for revenue, but less than 1% contribution for the year. But it's also true for the dilutive impact on profitability. So all are reflected in the guidance we gave."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Jayson. We had a terrific quarter. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $212 million, up 54% year-over-year. We added a quarterly record of more than 14,000 new paying customers, up 10% quarter-over-quarter, bringing our total paying customer count to over 154,000. We add 121 new large customers, those that pay us over $100,000 per year, up 53% year-over-year to a total of 1,537. Today, 58% of our revenue comes from those large customers.  Our largest customers continue to get larger and larger. Those spending over $500,000 a year, growing 68% year-over-year, and those spending over $1 million a year, growing 72% year-over-year. We now have 12 customers and partners spending over $5 million per year with us. And yet, we remain highly diversified, with no customer representing more than 5% of revenue.  Our land and expand motion continues to improve, with dollar-based net retention hitting a new record of 127% in the quarter, up 400 basis points year-over-year. New products and an increased interest in consolidating behind a single trusted vendor for network services has been the key to our continued customer expansion.  Efficiency has always been a hallmark of our business. And even in these inflationary times, we achieved a gross margin in the quarter of 78.7%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. That continues to be above our target gross margin range of 75% to 77%, and affords us the opportunity to selectively target competitors' customers, offering them bundles of products that work seamlessly together, reducing the number of vendors they need and providing them with modern solutions, all while saving them money at the same time. We are finding this in a especially compelling value proposition when it seems everyone else is raising prices or can't even say for certain when they'll be able to deliver their legacy hardware boxes.  We closed our largest acquisition ever in the quarter, buying Area 1 Security for $162 million. We have a very high hurdle rate for acquisitions being strongly biased towards internal development but Area 1 technology and team are special. We started out as a customer. I remember shortly after we implemented their solution, writing to our Chief Security Officer to ask if something was wrong, I hadn't seen any phishing reports in a few weeks, where usually our team would report double digits per day. It turned out Area 1 and their incredible e-mail security tech was the answer. By the way, if you're still seeing phishing messages in your own box, tell your IT team to call us. We now have a great solution.  Over the last few years, the customer of Area 1, we got to know their team. At Cloudflare, we're a bunch of geeks. We're good at snipping out when tech is real and when it's BS. The Area 1 team shares the same spirit, so they were fun to work with, and their tech definitely isn't BS. We talked to them briefly about a partnership, but it became quickly clear and made far more sense for them to join Cloudflare and fully integrate with our zero trust suite.  Let me give you a sense of how that's going. We extended offers to all the Area 1 team, and even in this hot labor market, 98% of them chose to join Cloudflare. And I'm not giving up hope on that last one Area 1 team member who hasn't yet. I think that says something about how good it fit the 2 companies are together, the technologies and the culture.  E-mail is the #1 source of network threats that no leading zero trust vendor has truly integrated e-mail security is a major blind spot the industry was guilty of. As you see others in the space now scramble to build, buy or partner to fill the hole we pointed out in their offerings, know that it's the best signal that Cloudflare's zero trust solution is resonating in the market and taking share no matter what they may say. And good luck to them. We got the best team and the best tech in the business.  Let's talk about some customer wins in the quarter, starting with Area 1. In the second half of Q1, Cloudflare and Area 1 sales team started working together. We saw a number of customer wins from existing Cloudflare customers adding Area 1, as well as from Area 1 pipeline deals that accelerated after news broke of our acquisition. Practitioners trust Cloudflare, and know that if we buy a company, the tech works and will scale. New customers who onboarded to Area 1 in the quarter included a major Asian airline, a U.S. bulge bracket investment bank and a Fortune 1000 trucking company.  Let me dig into that trucking company example of it. They were an existing Cloudflare customer. They were in the midst of a pilot testing a wide range of e-mail security vendors. In those tests, Area 1 caught twice as many phishing e-mails as the next best competitor, that the tech was now part of Cloudflare made the decision a no-brainer. The trucking company signed a 7,500 seats, $385,000 2-year deal. Watch this space. There's going to be a lot more stories like this one.  We continue to see success with our other zero trust products. A Midwestern U.S. state bought 75,000 seats in a 3-year, $5.1 million deal. The state was replacing legacy hardware, and had decided to move to a cloud-based solution when they began talking to us. It was a competitive deal, but the preferred Cloudflare's tightly integrated approach that gave them a single pane of glass, with integrated policies and threat intelligence. They also love our performance and network that had presence inside their state borders. This was an example of the sale in partnership with a major systems integrator, which we expect will be part of more and more large zero trust sales.  We are confident our implementation of these products has plenty of margin to support a robust partner ecosystem.  A large Indian media platform chose Cloudflare over Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks for their zero trust network. They signed a $150,000 deal for 5,000 seats. They appreciated how much more tightly integrated our solutions were than the competition.  We are going head-to-head with Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks more and more, and we like our win rates when we do.  A European Fortune 500 automotive company adopted Cloudflare's zero trust approach to help manage their global fleet of more than 10 million vehicles. They signed a contract worth $320,000 per year. We're seeing more and more of these IoT zero trust use cases, and believe there is significant opportunity to expand with this customer.  Speaking of expansion, a Fortune 500 software company expanded their relationship with us, bringing their annual run rate to $15 million per year. The new contract expanded our relationship to another internal IT division. We're helping them build their future scalable, secure, modern network. They repeatedly let us know, we were the only vendor they trusted in the space for such a mission-critical service.  On the theme of trust, a large social network signed a $3 million, 5-year contract. They are using our global network to authenticate the security of one of their messaging products. They have built the authentication application on Workers, our serverless compute platform, that Workers can keep up with their tremendous scale and volume is a testament to its effortless scalability.  Sticking with Workers, a large Australian software company adopted Workers to help power a collaboration tool. They signed a $145,000 contracts. They're using Workers' durable object functionality to build real-time global synchronization into the product. What we're seeing with Workers is that there's a natural expansion as smart software teams realize what they can do when they can write code and effectively deploy it directly into the Internet fabric. We expect this customer will continue to use Workers for more of their projects now that they've proven success with this one.  A Fortune 500 health care company signed a $1.2 million, 3-year deal. It's a pretty standard network security and performance use case for us, replacing legacy hardware. What I thought was interesting with that the IT team had moved from a large financial services customer of ours. As they change jobs, they brought Cloudflare to their new employer. I think we're going to see a lot more of this as practitioners have succeeded in their last job by leaning on us are moving on and moving up in their careers to new opportunities.  A Fortune 500 financial services company went all in on Cloudflare. They said that they see us as the future. They signed a 1.5 million, 3-year deal. It was driven by their Chief Security Officer. From start to finish, the sales cycle was around 4 months. They ripped out a number of legacy vendors and consolidated a number of network services behind us. They were tired of trying to find best-of-breed with every product, and instead ending, up with a Frankenstein map. They realized they could with us have the best-of-breed network that was tightly integrated with the features all efficient work together. We expect they will continue to grow their contracts now that they brought fully into Cloudflare architecture.  One last story. A Fortune 1000 gaming company signed a $3.3 million, 3-year contract. I love this story. They were using AWS, but found their security couldn't prevent the attacks they were seeing. After struggling to keep their application online, AWS's team eventually told them, \"You should just use Cloudflare.\" And so they did. [indiscernible] that let them and lots of other customers know that R2 is progressing to open beta next week, and we expect we'll be able to save them lots of AWS egress fees as well.  I wanted to close by talking about what we're seeing in Russia and Ukraine. I mentioned the region at the end of the last earnings call. A number of you reached out to say a theme out of place at the time. Unfortunately, it proved pressure. At Cloudflare, our global network serves as an early warning sensor for what's happening across the Internet.  In the month leading up to Russes and Basin, we saw characteristics cyber probing and other warning signs that were similar to what we've seen in Georgia and Crimea years earlier. Concerned, we've briefed Western government and offered our services to critical infrastructure providers and government institutions in Ukraine well before the physical invasion began. Many organizations there took us up on our offer of protection.  One of the stories of the war has been the relative lack of cyberattacks. That's not exactly accurate. There have been attacks. However, the number that have been successful are thankfully few. I'm proud of the role that Cloudflare has played to that end.  In Russia, Belarus and the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, we terminated all users tied to sanction parties and put additional checks in place for new customers signing up for our services. The region, including Ukraine, represents less than 1% of revenue. So we do not anticipate meaningful financial impact to our business, but we are conservatively reserving for the worst case, just like we did at the beginning of COVID.  One surprising thing that happened in the quarter was that our 1.1.1.1 app rose to #1 in the Russian app stores. We build that app and give it away to consumers for free as the world's largest test bed for a key component of our zero trust solution. It turned out in what was an increasingly thoughtful network environment inside Russia. Citizens there wanting to see what was really going on, installed the app in order to access Western media. Now we won't make any money on this. So some of you may wonder why am I telling you about it during the earnings call. Because it turns out doing the right thing and being there when some on the Internet needs us has always been core to Cloudflare and has always turned out to be good business for us over the long term. It's why I love my job. Successfully operating inside the hostile network environment that is Russia today makes our mobile app better for our enterprise zero trust customers. Ensuring Ukrainian critical infrastructure stays online means we can stand up to the biggest nation state-sponsored attacks for our largest government, financial services and other off-targeted customers, and briefing government on what's about to happen proves the power and unique insight we get from our global network.  We're in the trust business. We always have been. And in Q1, we built a lot of trust in a lot of quarters. Even in what I believe will prove to have been the hardest quarter for the industry since Q1 of 2020, trust is the secret to why we continue to grow paying customers in a record pace. It's why we received 133,000 job applications and saw attrition actually ticked down, while many others are struggling to hire. And while we continue to have a seat at the table in conversations around the future regulation of the Internet alongside today's check giants.  We will be there as the Internet needs us in Ukraine, Russia and everywhere else. And as we are, we are sowing the seeds to build what we intend to become not just what some of you may think of a SaaS, a steady, efficient, fast-growing SaaS company today, but an iconic trusted technology company that will define the future of the Internet for decades to come.  With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas to dive into our steady, efficient fast-growing numbers. Thomas, take it away. Sure. I think that what we have seen is that once the customer is on our network, we can see traffic across their systems typically and make intelligent recommendations over what additional products. So I'll give you a specific example. We're -- we have an incredible bot management product that is good at stopping malicious automated traffic on a customer's site. One of the things we do is even before someone is using the bond management product, we can look at their traffic patterns, see how many bots they have and then generate a report for them that says, \"You have a bot problem. Here's what we see. Would you like us to help you with it?\"  And so I think that those sorts of intelligent recommendations have been very good at getting customers to adopt additional products on our platform. I think going forward, as we've talked about in previous earnings calls, what you'll see us do more and more is bundle together our services into much broader licenses. And so you can see that with even some of the examples that I brought up on the prepared remarks earlier, where companies that buy into our total infrastructure commit to a certain spend with us, and then they are able to just continuously add additional products, and we true that up on an annual basis.  I think we are really unique in that we have that broad set of different products, where once you're using our service, we can start making intelligent recommendations, and we can solve so many problems for customers that those sort of site-wide licenses make sense. And I think that, that will continue to be a big piece of our growth going forward. Yes. I don't mean to critique your work, but your early note that went out suggested that we now have 14,000 customers. In fact, we actually added 14,000 new customers in the quarter, paying customers in the quarter, and are now at over 150,000 paying customers across the platform. I think that, that again is just us showing that across regardless of the size of customer, we've been able to very effectively get them onto our platform, nurture them over time, get them to use additional products and services and grow them into larger and larger customers.  And so I think it's -- at some level, when you look at growth like that, there's never one particular thing that you can point to and say, \"That was what was going on.\" Because, again, we service such a broad set of customers from very small to very, very large. But I'm really proud of the team and the hard work that they've done in order to deliver in continuing to grow our entire customer base. And that's -- and it's great to see us have a record add of 14,000 new customers in the quarter. Yes. We haven't seen that. I think it has been continued growth. So to, first of all, answer your question, just straight up, we said year-over-year traffic growth across our network of 75.8%, quarter-over-quarter growth of 15.9%, and that's in line with sort of the quarter-over-quarter growth that we've seen for the last period.  It's worth remembering that we don't bill primarily based on usage. We bill in a much more predictable way. And so I think that, that is a good indication that we are taking share from the rest of the industry.  But even in the post-COVID times, the traffic across our network continues to grow. And we do that while still maintaining above what our target gross margins are. I think the other thing which you didn't ask about, but I think it's interesting to compare, is how much usage has grown across our network. And where bandwidth has grown 75.8% year-over-year, CPU usage has actually grown 89.1%. And over the quarter, it's 15.9% for bandwidth and 21.8% growth for CPU usage.  What I think is -- why that's interesting and that's important, because I think that that's actually showing where people are not just using Cloudflare for moving bits around, but they're using Cloudflare in order to do intelligent processing of those bits, and that intelligence, which is really driven by like our Workers' edge computing product, as well as some of our security products, that's actually growing faster than bandwidth. And I think that, that delta shows why we're able to continue to grow revenue at the 54% that we did in the quarter. Does that answer your question? Yes. I think -- so first of all, any acquisition is a bit unusual for us because we have such a strong bias towards internal development and building products ourselves. I think though, Area 1 and e-mail security, in particular, makes just a ton of sense for us to do something around. If you look across every other protocol that is sent across the Internet, we protect whether it's HDB traffic or it's your SIP traffic to your phone system or it's SSH traffic, anything that's out there, any protocol, we protect. And we had just not dived into protecting SMTP and the e-mail protocols.  And I think a little bit of that is, honestly, my fault and our CTO john's fault, because both of us had worked in e-mail security prior to come to Cloudflare. And I think we have the scar tissue to prove from it. And so all the time, our sales team would come to us and say, \"Hey, customers really would love us to have an e-mail security product.\" Our engineering team would say, \"We have a ton of data that could help inform an e-mail security product. We should build it.\" And I think John and I would often veto that. I think that, that, frankly, was a blind spot on both of our sites. Because if you look at the data, e-mail security is by far the #1 source of threats that come into an organization. Almost every headline hacking incident that you've read about in the last 2 years, e-mail was the initial way that, that vulnerability was taken into account.  So I think it makes a ton of sense for us to have a solution. It's also incredibly powerful because we're the DNS provider that we can make it one-click deployment, where it's a customer of ours clicks a single button and instantly, they get the benefits of the Area 1 solution, and they can continue to use whoever their existing e-mail provider is, whether that's Outlook and Microsoft Office or its G-suite or if it's something that they're hosting on-premise. Much like Cloudflare, Area 1 is a proxy, but it's just a proxy for e-mail traffic.  So I think it's a very natural point for us to integrate. I think, it's a very easy sales motion for our customers to go through. And to the second part of your question, I think it integrates with the rest of our zero trust suite extremely well. So for instance, when you get an e-mail from an unknown sender, we can automatically isolate that e-mail using our browser isolation product so that any link that you click on in that link don't actually render on your laptop, but they're actually rendered at the edge of our network. So any malicious content that's in those links, we can stop.  And so I think that this is going to be a very effective way to introduce our zero trust suite to the market. It gets people to start to adopt a seat-based approach to our product very easy for our existing customers to deploy with 1 click. And I think it's going to be a gateway to the rest of our zero trust product, selling more of our gateway and access and browser isolation products as well. Does that answer your question? Yes. So I think that the wave 2 solutions, and I would characterize it a little bit differently. I would say that we have products like Magic Transit, Magic Firewall, that really do complement some of our more traditional products. They're all about protecting content, protecting your infrastructure. And then we have products like Gateway and Access and Browser Isolation, which are all about protecting users.  And so I think you pumped those sort of into wave 2. And that's true from a timing perspective, but they actually are slightly different and they -- and I think that they are both growing very well. But they are somewhat different in terms of the way that we go to market with those products. And in some cases, who the exact buyer is within an organization for those products.  And so I think we've seen really strong adoption for the Magic Transit product. That is replacing a lot of the traditional network DDoS protection services. I think particular strength in carriers that are starting to use the product as well, which I think -- which is a really exciting opportunity. And it's -- we're getting that because of the fact that we can just stand in front of much more traffic than possible -- as possible through any sort of box-based solution.  I think on the user-based products, we're seeing really good adoption of those, both for customers who are coming first for those products but then also for us to be able to sell those products to our existing customers. And there's a really natural extension between our traditional firewall products and the access product, and those dovetail very well together.  I think Cloudflare for Offices continues to progress really well, although it's very early in terms of what that will look like. We have, in the quarter, we announced some of the hardware that we are deploying, and we are starting to build that out within networks. I would say that rather than that us measuring the success of that product today based on the revenue that it generates, I think we are much more measuring the success of that product based on the willingness of landlords and network providers to invite us into their facilities and allow us to directly interconnect. And I think that, that is in every region where we've deployed the Cloudflare for Offices. That is trending at or ahead of what our expectations are. Sure. So first of all, as I mentioned, R2 is going to progress from a closed beta to an open beta next week. And next week, we have Platform Week, which is really very much focused on all of the different ways that Cloudflare can be a platform for developers to develop on, but really a focus around the various Workers' products. And I think we'll have some very exciting surprises as part of what we're rolling out over the course of the week as well.  I think that if you study developer platforms, for them to really reach escape velocity, takes between 8 and 12 years. And so Workers was launched in late 2017, so we're continuing to develop it. We're on that curve. I think the thing that has surprised me is that we're seeing very big companies with very sophisticated development teams getting excited about and realizing that Workers is a solution for a lot of the problems they have.  The 2 examples that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one major social network, that's a very sophisticated developer team that chose to build using Workers. And I think what we found is that once a team like that sees the power of what they can do with Workers, that really excites them, both within the organization they're at and also as they change jobs and go to other places where they take the technology with them. The same thing is true with the Australian software company, where doing something like real-time collaboration across multiple continents, if you're trying to do that with a traditional public cloud, it's a ton of work. With durable objects and Workers, it almost just works out of the box. And in fact, we have examples of how that's done. And I think that, that was something that was, again, incredibly well-received by that very sophisticated software engineering team, and we expect that they will continue to do more with the product.  So I think, again, it's going to be some time before it's something that we would -- that is dramatically contributing to revenue. But I am very pleasantly surprised at how many developers are flocking to the workers ecosystem, and we'll be talking a lot more about it next week. I think efficiency is just at our core. And so our network has always been designed in such a way to be able to get to be as efficient as possible. And so that has allowed us to deliver the services that we do. I think we sometimes get compared with some of the more traditional CDN-type vendors, and that's just never how we have seen ourselves, and it's not business that we have chased.  And so I think that where, if you're selling just bit delivery, it turns out that being a little bit faster -- really the returns are incredibly diminishing. Whereas if you're selling security, if you're selling intelligence, which is built into the network, if you're selling the ability to drive that, that has a very compelling use case.  I think from the beginning, we also always said that Cloudflare, one of the first tenants of Cloudflare was never lose on price. And I think that forced us to be efficient from the beginning. And so customers, I think, in this time where everyone is looking for ways to figure out how they can save money on their IT budgets and where many other vendors are trying to figure out how they can either hold or raise prices, I think we can continue to be pushing forward and taking share and especially taking that high-margin share from both existing hardware vendors who are having a hard time even delivering their products, as well as other cloud vendors that, again, I think are not as efficient as we've been.  So I think that's been key to our story since the earliest days. It will continue to be key to our story. And I think it's that efficiency is a hallmark of who we are at Cloudflare. Sure, Jim. So I think that we've been very consistent at saying that we are going to hold as close to breakeven on our operating margin as we can. I said on a previous call that if we showed massively positive earnings per share, that would mean something that we did something wrong because if we can continue to grow at the rates that we're guiding towards, there's nowhere else we should be putting that money other than back into the business to grow the business as quickly as possible.  And so I think that we are doing that, we've been very consistent in delivering that message. I don't think there's anything that has changed about that strategy. And again, I think we're managing towards a breakeven on operating margin.  In terms of the POPs, I think that -- I mean, we're already in well over 100 countries around the world. I think that when multinationals look to us, it's not our POP presence that has ever been -- certainly since we went public, standing in the way of them adopting us. And I think that if you look at the companies that we're highlighting in some of the examples, these are almost all massive, multinational companies that rely on our network, and think that it's the case.  I think the thing which is powerful about as we build out more POPs is that counterintuitively, because of the design of our network and because of the efficiency of our network that both Thomas and I just alluded to, it actually drives our cost down over time rather than driving it up. It takes a certain amount of servers in order to process a certain number of requests. So your CapEx is actually driven by the amount of usage of your service more than anything else.  What is powerful is because we have done the hard work on the networking and software side to make it so that any server, anywhere can handle any request, that means that as we continue to expand our network out that we're able to directly interconnect with the various ISPs and eyeball networks around the world and drive our cost down for things like bandwidth, co-location and other variable costs that are part of our business.  And so I think that, that's decomposing a little bit what the reason for our ability to continue to expand. And if in the future we need the darn snorkels and dive to the bottom of the ocean in order because we can get more efficiency in our network by putting a pop somewhere there, we are going to continue to do whatever is necessary to be able to deliver our services as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Yes. Federal is a big opportunity for us. [indiscernible] we think we'll continue to unlock that. We got word actually today that we have thumbs up from our sponsoring agency and are just waiting kind of in line with the overall federal agency to get that approved. So we think that's all going well. We've done everything that we can do, and it's a little bit like being at the DMV. You've got to kind of just wait for your number to get called. But we're confident that it will get called hopefully sooner than later. And if anyone federal DMV is listening in, there's a lot of agencies that want to use us. So hopefully, we can meet that requirement.  That is not holding us back from working with Accenture as well as other partners, and we've continued to see significant interest. I think the thing that I would come back to is the amount of trust that we have built in the sort of C-level equivalent of the federal government. The number of calls that our team, and including myself, have received from the people who are really trusted with securing the U.S. infrastructure, to understand what's going on in Ukraine, to ask us for help, protecting the infrastructure in the United States, I think that, that speaks incredibly well of us.  We actually launched, in partnership with CrowdStrike, as well as Ping Identity, in the quarter the Critical Infrastructure Protection Act. I was really honored by the White House is stepping up and saying that, that was something that they recommended any hospitals, utilities, or energy companies adopt as quickly as possible. So I think that we have an enormous amount of goodwill within the government. I think we are moving forward and think that there is an enormous opportunity to continue to deliver on that goodwill. And any day now, hopefully, the FedRAMP DMV will call our number, and we'll be able to announce that. That process is formally behind us. Yes, Alex, first of all, thank you for the kudos at the beginning. It's been a quarter where a lot of our team has been working tireless nights to make sure that as much of the Ukrainian infrastructure stays online and that services like 1.1.1.1 continue to allow people in parts of the world where they may not have free access to the Internet for them to be able to see what's happening. And I think that, that that's something that I'm really proud of our team to have done, and I appreciate you calling it out.  In terms of Cloudflare's percentage of Internet traffic, I think it's -- we don't really -- we know what our numerator is, but we don't know what the denominator is. And I don't think there's a good source of that. I think that we look at some proxies for that in other places. One is what percentage of the top million websites are behind us. And that number is around 20% today. I think what that underrepresents is a lot of our other products. It doesn't take into account products like our zero trust products, it doesn't take into account things like Magic Transit and other products.  But from a just pure what percentage of the web uses Cloudflare on, if you measure that using third-party sources, it's right around 20%. For API, I think that, that has been a trend that we've seen for quite some time, more and more of the traffic that passes through Cloudflare, its API traffic. In the quarter, we announced our updated API protection suite. We've seen really great adoption for that. Again, I think it's one of the things where it's all sort of the same protocols, but being able to understand that this is an API, validate that API, help developers really make sure that the schema that is being sent to and from that API is correct. Those are all things that our network is very good at delivering, and we're seeing strong customer interest and strong customer growth from that.  And the last thing I'd say is that Workers is a big -- there is no easier way to build an API today than on Workers. And I think that next week, during Platform Week, we're going to have a bunch of examples of customers and companies and developers that are doing exactly that. And I think that that's going to be a bigger and bigger piece of the Workers story going forward. So I don't think we've broken out the traffic from India and China, and I don't know precisely what the growth rates are. From a revenue perspective. So again, I think that those are both regions that are interesting to us. They're very different from one another. I think that we have seen a lot of success selling into the Indian market and been able to continue to expand our services there. And we've done a great job at both selling to customers, as well as finding ways to interconnect with what is a very complicated ISP model in India.  In China, we've always worked with partners. And so we have been a long-time partner with Baidu. We are a more recent partner with JD Cloud. And I think that in both -- in that case, that partnership is going extremely well. And again, it is complicated for any Western company to be operating in China. And so the fact that we have now been doing so since 2015, I think shows -- that shows the power of what we've been able to deliver.  Also, it's not always the purpose that we're trying to generate revenue from inside of China. The value of us having a network that extends into China is at least in equal part, if not greater, that we can form multinational companies that you can with 1 single network, deliver services to every country on earth, including inside of China. And I think that, that is unique for us to be able to do that and have the same features and functionality largely there that we have around the rest of the world. So I think both of those are markets at have their own complications, but we continue to operate in and see success. Sure. I'll take the first question, and then Thomas can close out with the second. As I said, I think that this will -- when the history books are written, turn out to be the most complicated quarter that tech companies have lived through, certainly since Q1 of 2020. And I think that there is real risk of a recession going forward. And even aside from that, I think that there is definitely we're all seeing the inflationary environment and the concerns around that.  What I like, though, is I can't imagine a company that is better positioned for a situation like that than we are. We're offering a service which is not a nice to have, but a must-have. We're offering a service in a way which saves customers money over what their existing solutions are. We've deployed the network in such a way that we can make sure that we service customers as we need them. And so what we saw in the quarter was definitely fires concern over what was going on in the world. But in many cases, that was actually having them come to us.  And so I think that as there are challenging economic times, we are extremely well positioned to provide what are critical services to make sure the Internet continues to work. And to me, it feels a lot like the beginning of COVID, where I think there's a lot of concern that's out there. But over time, what we find is, time and time and time again, customers are turning to us, saying we want to consolidate our spend from instead of spending across 10 different vendors, we want to put it all behind you. They like the fact that we have that bundled integrated approach, and they like the fact that we're able to save them money over what their legacy solutions are that are in place.  So I think that, that positions us very well for what may be -- what was -- what I think was already a challenging quarter for many companies. and I think it might be a challenging period for companies over the next period to come. This has been a challenging quarter as we've watched what world events have taken place. I'm incredibly proud of our team for having made sure that the Ukrainian infrastructure stayed online, that the people in the world could see what was really happening and providing a network with Cloudflare that really can stand up to any challenge that's ahead.  I really appreciate all the work of all of the Cloudflare employees. I appreciate all of our customers. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day and our Customer Day, which is next week in New York, and stay tuned for a lot of announcements. It's going to be a busy week for us, because it's also Platform Week, which is one of our Innovation Weeks, and we're expecting to announce a number of really great features. Thank you so much."

We achieved revenue of $362.5 million, up 32% year-over-year. We added 198 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 2,756 large customers, up 35% year-over-year. We saw particular strength in our largest customers with a record number of net new customers spending more than both $0.5 million a year and $1 million a year on an annualized basis. We signed our largest new logo with an expected total contract value over $30 million and our largest customer renewal with a total contract value of $60 million. We blew away our previous record for new ACV booked in the quarter. In Q4, new ACV booked grew nearly 40% year-over-year, making it not only our record in absolute ACV, but also the fastest percentage growth we've seen since 2021. Our pipeline closed rates sales force productivity, average steel size and linearity all improved markedly quarter-over-quarter. I continue to be encouraged by the early results we're seeing from our new sales recruiting and training programs. During the fourth quarter, the pipeline generated by the cohort under the new program was 2.1 times higher than the year ago cohort. And account engagement increased by 3.5 times compared with a year ago. I'm excited by our maturing sales execution and believe it will pay dividends in 2024 as these sales professionals fully rank. Our dollar-based net retention ticked down 1% quarter-over-quarter to 115%. Our gross margin was 78.9%, again, above our long-term target of 75% to 77% and up from 78.7% last quarter. We delivered an operating profit of $39.8 million, representing an operating margin of 11%. We also meaningfully outperformed on free cash flow generating $50.7 million during the quarter and approximately $120 million in free cash flow for the year. I'm proud of our team for their continued execution. The machine that underlies Cloudflare is firing efficiently on all cylinders, and we've been able to execute even as the macro environment remains choppy. Key to that execution has been improvement in our go-to-market efforts. 15 months ago, we brought on Marc Boroditsky to execute effectively a turnaround of Cloudflare's go-to-market team. At the time, we had enterprise customers, but we hadn't operationalized repeatedly and consistently landing them. We were also suffering from a COVID hangover and like much of the industry, have been flat on performance management. Mark changed all that. He's brought in the process and discipline we needed to be world-class in sales the same way we already were in product and engineering. It's hard to be the turned-around-guy, and we owe Mark a huge debt of gratitude for playing that role. But there's someone we always whispered about as our ideal go-to-market leader if we could ever have him as a full-time member of our team, Mark Anderson. He built Palo Alto Networks' world-class sales organization into the machine it is today. He has an incredible domain expertise and contacts in our industry. He's one of the great B2B sales software leaders. And as we were getting ready to go public, we couldn't quite commence them to run our go-to-market org, but we did the next best thing, inviting him to join our Board. Over the last four years, we've gotten to know each other on Cloudflare's Board. From there, he's provided invaluable counsel to me, Michelle and our go-to market leaders. And so after Alteryx, the company he's been running as CEO agreed to go private. He reached out and asked whether we'd be interested in not just having him as a coach, but also a player on the field, rolling up his sleeves and getting back to what he's best at. Running a world-class go-to-market organization, selling great products and delivering incredible value and support to customers. Given the deep relationship and trust we developed and his expertise and leadership in our field it was as close to a no-brainer, as I can remember in a long time. I wanted to invite Mark Anderson to the call to say a few words. Mark?\nMark Anderson: Thank you, Matthew. I've had the privilege to work closely with the great leadership team here at Cloudflare in my role as a member of the Board of Directors for the last 4.5 years, and I've been amazed, not at just what Cloudflare has accomplished to-date, but more importantly, how the market is increasingly moving to where Cloudflare is already uniquely positioned. The time to capitalize on these major technology shifts is now. When I start to think about where I could make the most impact during the next stage of my career. I reached out to Matthew and Michelle to see if I can help elevate Cloudflare's go-to-market organization to the next level. Operationalizing productivity at scale at Cloudflare will involve. One, augmenting foundational systems and tools that are already in place with the framework of execution that applies discipline and rigor to all that we do for customers and two, bringing on more stage appropriate talent to blend with our amazing sales team to best capture the massive market opportunity ahead of us. We all agree that my skill set and experience building and enabling world-class go-to-market organization matched perfectly with Cloudflare to further accelerate its next stage of growth at scale. And I'm extremely excited to work together with Matthew, Michelle and all of my fellow Cloudflarean to make Cloudflare one of the most iconic technology companies in the history of the industry.\nMatthew Prince: Thanks, Mark. I want to again thank Marc Boroditsky for getting us to this place. We couldn't have done it without him. He will continue to be an adviser to Cloudflare for the next several months to make sure Mark Anderson is set up for success. He will always be part of the Cloudflare team, and I'm excited to hear what challenges he takes on next. I also wanted to take this time to reaffirm that Michelle and I aren't going anywhere or changing our roles in anyway. I wake up every morning more excited about the opportunities we have to fulfill our mission of helping build a better internet. If you study the iconic technology companies, they are often mission-driven, founder-led but include a dynamic and evolving leadership team surrounding the founders who bring a wealth of experience for each stage of the company's journey. That a leader like Mark Anderson can get to know us over the last four years from his seat on our Board and then choose to join our team standing side-to-side with the other senior team we have assembled gives me confidence that we're on a path to being one of the iconic technology companies ourselves. We're not there yet. So I'm not satisfied, and I remain fully committed to that journey. With that, let me walk through some of the customer wins we had in the quarter. We were awarded a three-year contract with a ceiling value of $33 million for the US Department of Commerce which will be deploying services across our SASE application performance and security solutions. We believe deals like this validate the criticality of converging application performance, security, network and Zero Trust services on a unified platform and how Cloudflare can deliver a comprehensive, commercially off-the-shelf platform from a single vendor as compared with numerous point product competitors. A leading technology company, expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year, $6.6 million contract for Cloudflare's Zero Trust Suite to protect access for 10,000 employees and contractors. Given the company's highly complex and secure environment, implementing a first-generation Zero Trust vendor proved to be a challenge. This company had done a Zero Trust RFP a year prior, but when they reviewed Cloudflare's Zero Trust solution again, they were impressed by our significant progress in innovation. Not only was our rate of innovation a key differentiator, but with Cloudflare, they are able to simplify and consolidate Zero Trust application performance and security all on a single platform. A Fortune 500 hospitality company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a five-year, $4.3 million contract for 20,000 Zero Trust seats. This company approached us 15 months ago with a basic Zero Trust use case. The scope quickly expanded from one to several as this company sought to re-architect their entire Zero Trust approach. The lack of platform integration and the absence of strategic vision from their incumbent vendors, including a first-generation Zero Trust competitor, led them to Cloudflare for our easy-to-use comprehensive platform with a cloud-first architecture. Although performance improvement was not an important consideration early on, after a six-month paid pilot, the team was blown away by how much improvement they saw with Cloudflare stating, holy bleep, I've never seen Jira go this fast. A sophisticated tech company with one of the technical and daring engineering teams signed a two-year, $646,000 contracts. The company had recently experienced a breach, driving them to increase their security posture and adopt a Zero Trust approach. This company considered nearly every relevant vendor in the market, over 13 in total, and Cloudflare and one other competitor were selected for a proof-of-concept and 30-day pilot. After just 14 days, Cloudflare was fully configured and completed all success criteria, whereas our competitor was unable to get off the ground. The ease of deployment was key for this company who needed to design a solution in a very complex environment with Cloudflare, everything worked out of the box. A Fortune 500 technology company signed a two-year $6 million contract for advanced application security. The company was experiencing an increased DDoS attacks that a large hyperscale public cloud was unable to mitigate. These unmitigated attacks created significant latency resulting in a loss of traffic and potential revenue. They view Cloudflare as the leading expert in DDoS mitigation based on our HTTP/2 rapid reset publication and the compatibility of our Layer 7 security bundle with their self-hosted technology and public cloud vendors made Cloudflare an easy choice. It's just the beginning with this customer. A large US commercial airline expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a two-year $857,000 contract to procure Zero Trust seats. A great land-and-expand example. This is the third deal we've done with this customer in 2023 as they undergo a digital transformation project. They're using our full Zero Trust suite along with application services. They love our unified network, single pane of glass and speed of implementation. A fourth deal with them is already on the horizon. A local government authority in the UK signed a five-year $2.1 million contract for 4,700 Zero Trust seats. The government authority was pursuing a very large digital transformation project to modernize and improve security posture with a complete network refresh and the adoption of Zero Trust. Following a three-year engagement process, the authority was evaluating two competing Zero Trust vendors. Cloudflare entered the process in the late stages. Cloudflare One was selected as the core component of their modernization program due to our ease of use, seamless integration and expansive platform with a single control plane. In their words \"Cloudflare is easy, it just works.\" These days, no earnings conference would be complete without an update on AI. As of the end of 2023, we deployed GPUs in 120 cities globally, meaningfully ahead of our target of 100 cities. By the end of 2024, we plan to have inference tuned GPUs deployed in nearly every city that makes up Cloudflare 's global network and within milliseconds of nearly every device connected to the Internet worldwide. The breadth and potential impact of the use cases we are seeing with workers AI are extraordinary. And we're super excited about the opportunity to establish workers' AI serverless model built on Cloudflare's trusted global network as the best infrastructure for running AI inference tasks. From our launch in September to the month of December, the average number of daily workers' AI request increased 9x. Furthermore, one-third of the thousands of workers' AI account are new to the workers' platform, suggesting that workers' AI is not just significant opportunity in and of itself, but also a potential accelerant to adoption of the workers' overall platform. Inference, however, is only part of the AI equation. We are also extremely encouraged by the interest in Vectorize, our vector database which makes it easy, fast and affordable to index and store vectors to support use cases that require access not just to running models, but customized data too, as well as AI Gateway, which gives organizations the tool to cash, rate limit and observe their AI deployments regardless of where they're running. AI on workers platform is just getting started and there are exciting things on the road map that we look forward to sharing with you in the not-so-distant future. As I reflect back on the last quarter, I'm proud of our team. It feels like we're once again firing on all cylinders, but a quarter is only one data point. As we talked about throughout the last year, the macro environment remains challenging. IT buyers are still skittish. The world is not getting any less complicated. And as a company, we still have a ton of proof. Those were the dominant themes of 2023, and I think it's likely that will remain the themes of 2024. So while I'm encouraged by our results, we continue to remain prudent and focused on disciplined execution, building and improving our team, delivering exceptional value to our customers and solving some of the hardest engineering challenges the internet faces. With that, I'll hand it over to Thomas to walk through our financials. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. I want to take a moment to welcome Mark Anderson to the Cloudflare team too. Mark, we're incredibly excited to have you on board to further accelerate our next phase of growth at Cloudflare. Turning to our financial results. I'm pleased to share that the positive momentum from our focus on refining our go-to-market strategies and operations continued during the fourth quarter. As Matthew mentioned earlier, pipeline growth rates, sales productivity, average deal size and linearity all improved compared with last quarter. Strength in our business this quarter was driven by robust momentum with large customers, significant progress in the public sector and growth in Cloudflare One, including the largest new customer win in the company's history with a contract ceiling value of $33 million. Importantly, we also continue to maintain our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and act as good stewards of investors' capital. Operating profit increased nearly 2.5 times year-over-year and we significantly outperformed on free cash flow, generating a record $50.7 million during the fourth quarter. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 32% year-over-year to $362.5 million. From a geographic perspective, the US represented 52% of revenue and increased 30% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 38% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 25% year-over-year. Turning to our customer metrics. In the fourth quarter, we had 189,791 paying customers representing an addition of roughly 27,700 paying customers in 2023 and an increase of 17% year-over-year. We were pleased to see revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter increased again to 66% of revenue up from 63% in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2023, revenue from large customers represented 64% of total revenue compared to 61% in 2022 and 54% in 2021. As Matthew referenced earlier, we added a record number of net new customers spending more than $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. For the full year, we ended the year with 346 customers that spend over $500,000 with us, a 56% increase year-over-year, and we ended the year with 118 customers that spent over $1 million with us, a 39% increase year-over-year. We also exited 2023 with three customers spending at least $20 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. One of which signed the largest total contract value renewal agreement in our company's history of $60 million in the fourth quarter. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 115% during the fourth quarter representing a decrease of one percentage point sequentially. As we mentioned last quarter, there can be some variability in this metric quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to believe the prior decelerating trend in DNR is stabilizing near these levels. Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 78.9%, representing an increase of 20 basis points sequentially and an increase of 150 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin was 78.3% for fiscal 2023, remaining of our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. Network CapEx represented 8% of revenue in the fourth quarter as we continue to benefit from our focus on driving greater efficiency from our infrastructure and the uniqueness of our platform to onboard new workloads. We expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue in fiscal 2024. With the evolution of the composition of our infrastructure, we undertook an assessment of the useful lives of our service and network equipment. In January 2024, we determined that continuous advancements in hardware technology and improvements in our data center designs have increased the efficiency in how we operate our equipment, resulting in the estimated useful lives of these assets extending from four to five years starting in fiscal 2024. We estimate this change will reduce depreciation by approximately $20 million for fiscal 2024 for assets and service as of December 31st of 2023, recorded primarily in the cost of revenue. As we discussed previously, we view our margin efficiency as one of Cloudflare's key competitive advantages, and we intend to leverage this opportunity as a strategic weapon to increasingly disrupt markets through continued innovation on our platform and differentiated product packaging. Turning to operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3% year-over-year to 68%. Our total number of employees increased 14% year-over-year bringing our total headcount to 3,682 at the end of the quarter. We'll continue to pace hiring based on market conditions over the course of fiscal 2024 and remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Sales and marketing expenses were $145.2 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 40% from 41% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $59.5 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% from 18% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $41.5 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% from 12% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $39.8 million compared to $16.8 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 11%, an increase of 490 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income in the balance sheet. Our income in the quarter was $53.5 million or a dilutive net income per share of $0.15. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $50.7 million in the fourth quarter or 14% of revenue compared with $33.7 million or 12% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations or RPO came in at $1.245 billion, representing an increase of 15% sequentially or 37% year-over-year. Current RPO was 73% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. We are encouraged by the progress we delivered during the fourth quarter in terms of improving close rates and productivity metrics. However, mixed macroeconomic data points serve as a reminder that we are operating in a business environment that also showing signs of improving exiting 2023, continues to be challenging to predict. As a result, we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024, and we are fully committed to continuing to adapt our tactics and strategies in response to any positive or negative external variables just as we did in 2023. Now turning to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $372.5 million to $373.5 million, representing an increase of 28% to 29% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $34 million to $35 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 11%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.13, assuming approximately 356 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.648 billion to $ 1.652 billion, representing an increase of 27% year-over-year. We anticipate the weighting of revenue in the first half versus second half of 2024 to be similar to 2023. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $154 million to $158 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 11% for 2024 and we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.58 to $0.59, assuming approximately 358 million shares outstanding. After having achieved significant free cash flow of approximately $120 million in 2023, we expect free cash flow to be relatively consistent with operating profit for the full year 2024. With the first half lower and the second half higher compared with operating profit. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them solve some of the hardest problems that they face when modernizing, transforming and securing their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your First question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Matthew, it seems like there's a confluence of factors that led to your outperformance. I was wondering if you could just unpack a little bit deeper in terms of some of the common themes. I know you mentioned enterprise strength, but what else are you seeing that's leading to this magnitude of outperformance?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks, Brent. I think the first thing really is what we talked a lot about on the call, which is just a real focus on go-to-market excellence and I think Marc Boroditsky, who really worked hand-in-hand with Mark Anderson on our Board, have done a great job over the last 15 months of really focusing on how we make sure that we're as great in go-to-market as we have been in product and engineering. And I think that's the biggest thing to point out. I think the second thing is that we've really seen strength in our Zero Trust and SASE products. Some of the biggest wins that we saw in the quarter were big Zero Trust deals. And I think that those products have caught up significantly. And you'll see in the Analyst Day, Industry Analyst reports and others that we're very quickly becoming one of the real leaders in that space. And I think over time, we will surpass many of the first-generation Zero Trust vendors and that really opens up another leg on the stool. And then lastly, I just continue to be really astonished by the rate at which our developer platform is growing. AI is not yet contributing materially to revenue. But it has contributed materially to developer excitement over the platform. And we're seeing more and more large deals, more and more interesting applications coming in using the workers' platform and that has gone well as well. So I think operational excellence in go-to-market, I think, that really strength around our Zero Trust products and then just continued outperformance on our developer platform. And those things all came together in Q4 of 2023.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Matthew.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question, Team. Great hire in Mark Anderson. I realize it's fresh, still fresh, and Matthew, you talked a little bit on the call about what he's going to be focused on. But I guess maybe just I wanted to double click on that. Are there some specific sales processes or partner motion that you think Mark is going to be focused on to really drive that next level of enterprise growth? And maybe could you talk about overall rep productivity, which I know has been a big focus for you all over the last year.\nMatthew Prince: Sure. Matt, I appreciate it. So first of all, I think working with Mark Anderson has been a big piece behind the scenes of the improvements that we've seen in the go-to-market performance that we've had so far. And so his, as a Board member, his hands have been involved in a lot of the strategic decisions we've made, a lot of the focus that we've made. And so I think this is less of a radical change in terms of the strategy, and it's more of a continuation of what we have done. That said, I think that the thing which Mark brings, which is unique and as we thought of who would be our ideal sales leader, and we really started thinking about that before we went public. Mark was top of the list because of the domain expertise, because of the relationships that he has, because of the trust that he's built in the industry. And because of the other sales professionals that really have worked with him and want to follow him and have their own, again, expertise and relationships in the industry as well. And so I think that Mark Anderson will continue a lot of what Marc Boroditsky has done, continue to professionalize our organization, continue to move up market, continue to really focus on rep productivity, focus on making sure that we have all of the right training, all of the right ramping resources that reps need focused on making sure that our sales process is as efficient as possible. And I think that will be a big piece of what he is delivering. I think if you zoom out from that, the other thing which is a big initiative for us is just looking at our overall platform and saying, how can we make it actually much easier, not only for our internal team to sell, but also for partners to sell as well. Right now, we have a ton of different products. And I think bringing that together and finding ways to really make that, those products, not just individual products, but as a platform and an overall platform that's where we tend to win is when people buy that overall platform. And that's where there really isn't a ton of competition when people are comparing the total platform that Cloudflare offers versus anyone else in the space. We are able to deliver a much more robust network security, performance, reliability package than any other vendor that's in that space. And I think Mark helps us deliver that and continue again on some of the great work that Marc Boroditsky had started and really set him up for success.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great color. If I can ask one follow-up to Thomas. Your guide for '24 revenue, I think it calls for about 600 basis point deceleration. Obviously, you talked about a lot of positive sequentially, but also some of the caution that you still have about the macro. Just wondering if you could unpack a little bit more some of the assumptions there. I think you noted maybe NRR might be nearing a bottom. But just what's built into that in terms of like logo adds, maybe an improvement in NRR, but just sort of unpack that a little bit more. Thank you.\nThomas Seifert: Yes. Obviously, we had a very good fourth quarter with a lot of good data points, pointing in the right direction. The improvement that Matthew was talking about on the go-to-market side. Not only in terms of productivity, but pipeline improved there, deal sizes improved linearity went better. We also saw their best quarter-over-quarter improvement from an RPO perspective. This is all pointing in the right direction. But we still have to cope with the fact that one data point alone is hard to change your prediction and your trajectory. So we are still cautious about everything else that is going on. Matthew mentioned in his part that the big scenes that we saw last year from a macroeconomic perspective, skittishness of buyers and budget releases is still continuing. And I think this informed our view for the year. And obviously, we'll adjust our strategy and approach to the year as we have, unless we collect more data points. But it served us well over the last four years as a public company, to look really hard at the data we have and draw the right conclusions from it. And I hope that '24 will get us to the same outcome.\nMatthew Hedberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Thank you so much for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to start with a question on SASE. So you rattled off about a dozen large Zero Trust deals in your prepared remarks and you're clearly seeing some very strong demand from large customers, which I think coincides with a lot of the feedback we've been hearing about how Cloudflare is having more success penetrating that mid and large enterprise space with your Zero Trust solution. So maybe if you could comment on your sort of secret to success in getting these large deals closed because it seems like it's -- there's more to it than just a maturation of your platform.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Andy. I think that, first of all, the -- we didn't start out as a company that had a Zero Trust platform. And so that's something that was a very natural add-on to our network. We think it's very complementary with the other services that we offer. And I think that as we studied the industry and studied the space, it was clear that this set of solutions ended up squarely in our bailiwick of what it was that we were delivering. And so that I think that, that was a very natural place, but we are new to this space. And things take time and especially in the larger buyers, they want validation like Gartner and Forrester and other industry analysts saying that you should be in the consideration set. And so there's a bit of a chicken and egg issue where you have to sort of start to get your first large customers and your early adopters in order for the Gartners and Forresters to put you in consideration. And then from that, you start to build that reputation with the industry analysts, and that gets you in more deals. And what we find is when we're in the consideration set, we're just a next-generation platform, and we're faster, we're more secure, we're more reliable, and we're a better solution for a lot of vendors. And so not only are we winning the greenfield opportunities, but we're increasingly winning opportunities from first-generation Zero Trust vendors where their customers aren't satisfied with the solutions they have and they're moving fully to us. So I think that a lot of it has been just the maturing of our platform, but not just from a technology perspective, we're pretty good at that, and we have a lot of control of that. But also just from an understanding in the industry that this is something that we offer. An understanding of how the various components of Cloudflare fit well together. And I think that, that's something that becomes itself a flywheel which we expect will continue to deliver success for us in this space over time.\nAndrew Nowinski: Sounds like especially with Mark Anderson joining now as well too. I want to ask a quick follow-up on Vectorize because I think it's really interesting and how it may potentially be driving growth of R2 as well. From talking to some industry folks, it sounds like customers are starting to recognize how important a vector database is as it relates to inference and fine-tuning models. But I'm curious, I know it's still early days, but what is the feedback on Vectorize? And are you actually seeing a pull-through or sort of a push to revenue on to R2 as well from that? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. The way that we see, the space in general is we want to have all of the different components that you need in order to build just a full-featured AI application. And that means supporting as many models as possible and some of the work that we're doing with the major model vendors like the Metas of the World, the marketplaces like Hugging Face gives us that. We want to have the best place for inference and we think that we're Goldilocks in that space, where the centralized public clouds are too far away and your device that you're holding in your hand or wearing on your wrist is often doesn't have enough power. But where we are sitting in between gives that really incredible place for inference. But then the next step of that is you have to be able to take those models and make them your own. And that's exactly what Vectorize does. It allows you to customize those models and tune them, the fine-tuning around making them your own. And so what's been interesting about that is that being local and having presence all around the world ends up mattering in various places, an example that a customer gave us the other day was that if you have a model and it responds in the United States and it sells color, C-O-L-O-U-R, it feels very foreign, whereas if it's in the UK and it spells as C-O-L-O-R, it also feels very foreign. And so the ability to not just tune models, but tune them locally, while still having the power of beefy GPUs that can then run the inference task. That's a really killer combination. And as you said, it's built on top of the existing primitives that we have, including R2 which is our object storage space. And so while it's early in the entire AI space. I think we are very well positioned and very strategic. And if you look at things like the various downloads of our libraries, on public -- open source repos, they are taking off like crazy. And it is incredibly encouraging and I think will become a larger and larger part of our business going forward.\nAndrew Nowinski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hey, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe just stick on the Edge AI theme, Matthew. I'm just curious, I know it's very early days, but as you deploy these GPUs at all your locations worldwide, how are you feeling from a capacity standpoint, from a CapEx perspective and your ability to meet the demand as some of the sort of inference starts to ramp? And then maybe a follow-up for Thomas, I think variable revenues are a very low percentage of your overall sales. Can you give us any context of how that looks for Q4 relative to Q3? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So I'll take the first question and Thomas can take the second. I'll start with -- in a place that you might not expect, which is our success in the Zero Trust market has actually helped empower our ability to invest in the developer platform and especially the AI market. To understand that, the nature of how our business works is that every single service that we run is capable of running on every single piece of equipment that's out there. So we don't run a different network for our security products than we do for our performance products. We don't run a different network for the CASB service that we have versus our access versus our DDoS mitigation, it's all the same machines that are running across that. And so one of the secrets to Cloudflare's success has been that we've been able to always look for places where there is more sort of unused capacity and then effectively act as a giant scheduler in order to make that capacity more productive. And what's been interesting about the Zero Trust space is that the very nature of how that traffic works, where our first-generation services were all reverse proxy services. The traffic was flowing kind of in one direction, whereas our Zero Trust services are all what's called forward proxy services, the traffic is flowing in the other. But it turns out that you can actually have traffic flow both directions without having additional CapEx cost. And so as a bigger and bigger part of our revenue is the Zero Trust products, it means that it actually frees up CapEx as a percentage of revenue for us to go after other opportunities. And so that's what has freed up us to go after a lot of the AI opportunities that we've had. It was freed up our ability to acquire the GPUs and invest behind the demand that we're seeing. And I feel really good because at core, what we are really good at is running a giant network, as a giant scheduler and then wringing as much efficiency and utilization out of that as possible. And so we have been able to stay ahead of the demand that we've seen for the GPUs and other resources that we need for some of these newer products. And we are complementing that by also adding revenue, which is just much less CapEx efficient because it's much less CapEx intensive and much more CapEx efficient because it's running on top of the same platform. Hopefully, that makes sense. But it really is part of the key to our business. And it's part of why we have the gross margins that we do where some of the other companies that are point solutions only doing one of these things have much worse margin profiles.\nThomas Seifert: Before I answer your second question, maybe a bit more color to what Matthew just said. I mean you really could see the inherently efficient architecture of the network in the fourth quarter. Our network CapEx was 8% of revenue in the fourth quarter. And we were ahead of delivering GPU capacity. We were at the 120 cities out of our plan of 100. And the guidance of 10% to 12% of revenue for this year includes a full build-out and bringing GPU capacity into pretty much every location we have. And on top of that, making sure that the network grows with the traffic that we put on our network. So that is, I think, one of the key competitive advantages we have is the network architecture and that's just another proof point in the fourth quarter. Regarding your question on variable revenue, variable revenue in the fourth quarter was a bit higher than it was in the third quarter, but it's still a small percentage of our overall revenue. This will change over time. As our packaging and the offerings we bring to the market will have higher variable components. But for the fourth quarter, it was still a small part of our overall revenue and revenue mix.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi. Good afternoon. Matthew, you mentioned that a third of workers' AI accounts are new to workers. How could this be potentially an accelerant to your developed platform overall? And could you maybe give us some color on the adoption of workers in terms of the serverless model by developers relative to competitors?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, I think that if you study developer platforms, they inherently take some time to really take off and take hold. And it averages about 10 years from when they launch before they seem like they're getting to that. And the reason for that is because of the fact that you need early adopters, those early adopters need to build something, which is a killer app, which people say, wow, I couldn't have built that in any other way. Some of the people who are behind that first killer app need to then go on and start other services, other companies, build other things. There's an ecosystem that has to develop around all of that. And that inherently takes some time to take off. Developer platforms are adopted. They're not sold. And so again, I think that we've been very excited about the rate at which things have been adopted at Cloudflare for our developer platform, but we've also been realistic that for that developer platform to take off, inherent in how these develop, there is some time. There are a handful of ways that you can have shortcuts. One of those is to attach yourself to other developer ecosystems, which are really robust. And so some of the ways that we are effectively providing the underlying infrastructure for some major other platforms that are out there, a number of the big e-commerce platforms and other things. That helps train developers early on how to build with us and again is one of the shortcuts to get there. Another one is attaching yourself to wherever there is a lot of interest in the developer ecosystem. And so I think that as you look out at the AI space and we try to survey what are the most common cloud platforms that are being used across the hottest AI start-ups and companies that are out there. Cloudflare is the most common to that. And I think that again accelerates the rate at which you're able to get that adoption. And so if you look at things like NPM downloads of packages and you compare sort of the things that you would download to run on Cloudflare workers versus competitors like AWS' serverless offering. It's been pretty amazing that we've actually caught and now passed AWS by some measures in terms of the packages which are being downloaded that are out there. And again, we're a much newer platform. And so I'm encouraged that we'll be hopefully taking that average time for new developer platforms to get reach scale down because of some of the success we've seen and again I'm really proud of our team and how they've executed in delivering this.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTimothy Horan: Thank you. Related to the previous question. Can you maybe update us on your best guess on timing when the workers' platform starts to drive some material revenue when it starts to move the needle in. And maybe the same thing for AI. I know you said kind of not this year. And what do you think for both these platforms, what does it mean for overall growth rates for the company? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think what has been interesting has been that workers is a big piece of a lot of the deals that we see. So it's still in somewhere around 20% of the large deals that we closed, have some workers component to it. And that's held actually fairly steady, but those deals have continued to go up and up. So it depends on how. We don't break out the various pieces of Cloudflare because we think that the platform functions very well as one unified platform. And we close more deals because we have workers involved. But a lot of times, that includes our reverse proxy security services oftentimes includes our Zero Trust security services. And what we really want to be is not a one-trick pony for any one of our customers. We want to actually have multiple different things that they rely on and be that strategic vendor that provides a broad set of solutions to them. So I think it's already materially driving new business and large deals. But as the workers platform, I think the AI space, I think a lot of the money, which is being spent on AI right now, especially with some of the hyperscale public cloud. A lot of that is for training of models that is not -- we are not the right place to actually do model training. But as that transitions over time and people start to figure out how can you take those -- the models that you've built and turn them into real products. I think that's where you'll start to see a much more significant share of -- you'll start to see revenue that is showing up is meaningful to us in terms of delivering the value in the AI space. But I think it's -- we're still so early. And I think that the thing to track is less about us. It's more about how long does it take product managers and engineers to really figure out how to harness these new tools into providing customer value. I think we've seen a ton of -- I mean, the challenging thing with AI is it is really easy to make a demo, but it's very hard to make a product. There's a ton of value that will be created here, but I think it's going to still take some time. And I think it's going to be up to some things that are somewhat out of our control. But I can't imagine being better positioned than we are.\nTimothy Horan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh with Citizens JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Hi, Team. Thanks for taking my question. Matthew, maybe for you, I wanted to just sort of round up all the different kind of themes and things that you've been talking about throughout. You've got a platform of platforms where you're playing in AI, you're playing with developers and workers and Zero Trust et cetera creates a big TAM, but then at the same time from a go-to-market perspective, you have a lot of different stakeholders and buyers within the organization that you have to try to round up and sell that vision. So where do you think you need to go from just a go-to-market perspective, especially with Mark coming on board now? In terms of whether it's internal enablement, simplifying pricing and packaging like you talked about kind of how do you -- how do you thread that needle, I guess, of all those different kind of people? And how do you see that kind of playing out kind of this coming year and beyond? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yeah, so I think our strategy remains our strategy, which is land with one product and then demonstrate, build trust, demonstrate value and then expand to help customers both create more value and save money across their overall all platform. And what we see over and over again is that the customer that just this last quarter signed a $60 million total contract value renewal. They started with one product and we're a $60,000 customer a year when they first started. So that works. I think operationalizing that now is the thing which we've made huge strides on over the last 15 months and I think Mark Anderson will continue to help with that. What I think is really attractive about Mark Anderson is, yes, he knows the security space and the network security space from his time at Palo Alto Networks, but also from his time at Palo Alto Networks, they went from really a one product company to a platform company. And that's something which we really admire and think is rare when companies figure out that play. We've got that set of products. We've got a lot of customers. And now it's how do we, again, continue to demonstrate value, I think, bringing on incredibly talented leaders like Mark Anderson, who are trusted and respected in the space who have run this play before and been successful with it, and it can now take the breadth of products that we have and the opportunity we have and build an iconic company and an iconic go-to-market organization. Again, I'm incredibly honored to have him on board, and his first day was today, and he's already rolling up his sleeves and getting to work.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for taking the question. Matthew, just two quick ones. You mentioned in the prepared remarks about the public business just getting being fairly strong, and you mentioned the US Department of Commerce. Can you give us any color about on adoption in the public sector? And then just tied to that, you were very early and very right in talking about the macro becoming weak several years ago. And I'm just curious, I know I listened in your prepared remarks, I just wanted to take your temperature about how you're just feeling in general about the way that the demand environment is currently? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, so sort of related questions, actually. I think that our federal business as well as our SLED business state, local education, and our global government business has all been real signs of strength. And I think that, in part, is because of the fact that the world is getting scarier and we're seeing more attacks. In 2022, it was actually very quiet on the cyber front, whereas the back half of 2023 and especially after the Hamas invasion and kidnappings in Israel really took off in terms of cyber-attacks that were going on around the world. And I think governments recognize the importance of staying safe and secure. More than half of the world's population will vote in 2023 in elections. And so I think the fact that we've been leaders in protecting elections and making sure that elections are run without cybersecurity being part of the story has gotten us in the conversation in a lot of places around the world. And I think that we have a maturing set of just go-to-market motions and a really great leadership team around our state and local business or excuse me our federal and state business, which is showing real signs of promise. So I would expect that, that business continues to be strong throughout 2024. Your second question is kind of the flip side of that, which is I think that the macro continues to be challenging. There are two hot wars going on right now. I think we are not out of the woods economically in terms of getting totally ahead of inflation. Again, I think in the US that looks better than some of the other places in the world. There's a lot of ways that you can imagine the world continues to get more complicated. And I think IT buyers continue to be skittish. Q4 definitely felt like people were starting to make decisions, and they were starting to say that there are certain things that are must-have versus nice-to-have. And I think we continue to be sorted into the must-have bucket. But we continue to be very prudent and very thoughtful as we think about our business, we're trying to scale behind the demand that we see, not get cocky about ramping anything too fast. But in a world that is increasingly difficult and increasingly complicated, I'm glad that we're in the business of helping provide cybersecurity, and I'm incredibly proud of our team for living up to our mission of helping make sure the internet stays safe, secure and reliable.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions today. I will turn the call back to Matthew Prince for closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: I just wanted to thank the entire Cloudflare team for just all the incredibly hard work over Q4 and into the beginning of 2024. And we were just so incredibly proud of the work that everyone is doing. I'm excited to add Mark Anderson to our team full time. He started actually today, as I said, and he's already rolling up his sleeve. I want to thank Marc Boroditsky, who will continue to act as an Advisor to Cloudflare and help with the transition. He's been nothing but a class act throughout this and we couldn't have gotten here. Thanks to all of our customers, investors, we'll see you back here in about three months. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I've had the privilege to work closely with the great leadership team here at Cloudflare in my role as a member of the Board of Directors for the last 4.5 years, and I've been amazed, not at just what Cloudflare has accomplished to-date, but more importantly, how the market is increasingly moving to where Cloudflare is already uniquely positioned. The time to capitalize on these major technology shifts is now. When I start to think about where I could make the most impact during the next stage of my career. I reached out to Matthew and Michelle to see if I can help elevate Cloudflare's go-to-market organization to the next level. Operationalizing productivity at scale at Cloudflare will involve. One, augmenting foundational systems and tools that are already in place with the framework of execution that applies discipline and rigor to all that we do for customers and two, bringing on more stage appropriate talent to blend with our amazing sales team to best capture the massive market opportunity ahead of us. We all agree that my skill set and experience building and enabling world-class go-to-market organization matched perfectly with Cloudflare to further accelerate its next stage of growth at scale. And I'm extremely excited to work together with Matthew, Michelle and all of my fellow Cloudflarean to make Cloudflare one of the most iconic technology companies in the history of the industry."

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. I want to take a moment to welcome Mark Anderson to the Cloudflare team too. Mark, we're incredibly excited to have you on board to further accelerate our next phase of growth at Cloudflare. Turning to our financial results. I'm pleased to share that the positive momentum from our focus on refining our go-to-market strategies and operations continued during the fourth quarter. As Matthew mentioned earlier, pipeline growth rates, sales productivity, average deal size and linearity all improved compared with last quarter. Strength in our business this quarter was driven by robust momentum with large customers, significant progress in the public sector and growth in Cloudflare One, including the largest new customer win in the company's history with a contract ceiling value of $33 million. Importantly, we also continue to maintain our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and act as good stewards of investors' capital. Operating profit increased nearly 2.5 times year-over-year and we significantly outperformed on free cash flow, generating a record $50.7 million during the fourth quarter. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 32% year-over-year to $362.5 million. From a geographic perspective, the US represented 52% of revenue and increased 30% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 38% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 25% year-over-year. Turning to our customer metrics. In the fourth quarter, we had 189,791 paying customers representing an addition of roughly 27,700 paying customers in 2023 and an increase of 17% year-over-year. We were pleased to see revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter increased again to 66% of revenue up from 63% in the fourth quarter last year. For fiscal 2023, revenue from large customers represented 64% of total revenue compared to 61% in 2022 and 54% in 2021. As Matthew referenced earlier, we added a record number of net new customers spending more than $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. For the full year, we ended the year with 346 customers that spend over $500,000 with us, a 56% increase year-over-year, and we ended the year with 118 customers that spent over $1 million with us, a 39% increase year-over-year. We also exited 2023 with three customers spending at least $20 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. One of which signed the largest total contract value renewal agreement in our company's history of $60 million in the fourth quarter. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 115% during the fourth quarter representing a decrease of one percentage point sequentially. As we mentioned last quarter, there can be some variability in this metric quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to believe the prior decelerating trend in DNR is stabilizing near these levels. Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 78.9%, representing an increase of 20 basis points sequentially and an increase of 150 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin was 78.3% for fiscal 2023, remaining of our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. Network CapEx represented 8% of revenue in the fourth quarter as we continue to benefit from our focus on driving greater efficiency from our infrastructure and the uniqueness of our platform to onboard new workloads. We expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue in fiscal 2024. With the evolution of the composition of our infrastructure, we undertook an assessment of the useful lives of our service and network equipment. In January 2024, we determined that continuous advancements in hardware technology and improvements in our data center designs have increased the efficiency in how we operate our equipment, resulting in the estimated useful lives of these assets extending from four to five years starting in fiscal 2024. We estimate this change will reduce depreciation by approximately $20 million for fiscal 2024 for assets and service as of December 31st of 2023, recorded primarily in the cost of revenue. As we discussed previously, we view our margin efficiency as one of Cloudflare's key competitive advantages, and we intend to leverage this opportunity as a strategic weapon to increasingly disrupt markets through continued innovation on our platform and differentiated product packaging. Turning to operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3% year-over-year to 68%. Our total number of employees increased 14% year-over-year bringing our total headcount to 3,682 at the end of the quarter. We'll continue to pace hiring based on market conditions over the course of fiscal 2024 and remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Sales and marketing expenses were $145.2 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 40% from 41% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $59.5 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% from 18% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $41.5 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% from 12% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $39.8 million compared to $16.8 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 11%, an increase of 490 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income in the balance sheet. Our income in the quarter was $53.5 million or a dilutive net income per share of $0.15. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $50.7 million in the fourth quarter or 14% of revenue compared with $33.7 million or 12% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations or RPO came in at $1.245 billion, representing an increase of 15% sequentially or 37% year-over-year. Current RPO was 73% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024. We are encouraged by the progress we delivered during the fourth quarter in terms of improving close rates and productivity metrics. However, mixed macroeconomic data points serve as a reminder that we are operating in a business environment that also showing signs of improving exiting 2023, continues to be challenging to predict. As a result, we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024, and we are fully committed to continuing to adapt our tactics and strategies in response to any positive or negative external variables just as we did in 2023. Now turning to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $372.5 million to $373.5 million, representing an increase of 28% to 29% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $34 million to $35 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 11%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.13, assuming approximately 356 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.648 billion to $ 1.652 billion, representing an increase of 27% year-over-year. We anticipate the weighting of revenue in the first half versus second half of 2024 to be similar to 2023. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $154 million to $158 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 11% for 2024 and we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.58 to $0.59, assuming approximately 358 million shares outstanding. After having achieved significant free cash flow of approximately $120 million in 2023, we expect free cash flow to be relatively consistent with operating profit for the full year 2024. With the first half lower and the second half higher compared with operating profit. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them solve some of the hardest problems that they face when modernizing, transforming and securing their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Yes. Obviously, we had a very good fourth quarter with a lot of good data points, pointing in the right direction. The improvement that Matthew was talking about on the go-to-market side. Not only in terms of productivity, but pipeline improved there, deal sizes improved linearity went better. We also saw their best quarter-over-quarter improvement from an RPO perspective. This is all pointing in the right direction. But we still have to cope with the fact that one data point alone is hard to change your prediction and your trajectory. So we are still cautious about everything else that is going on. Matthew mentioned in his part that the big scenes that we saw last year from a macroeconomic perspective, skittishness of buyers and budget releases is still continuing. And I think this informed our view for the year. And obviously, we'll adjust our strategy and approach to the year as we have, unless we collect more data points. But it served us well over the last four years as a public company, to look really hard at the data we have and draw the right conclusions from it. And I hope that '24 will get us to the same outcome. Before I answer your second question, maybe a bit more color to what Matthew just said. I mean you really could see the inherently efficient architecture of the network in the fourth quarter. Our network CapEx was 8% of revenue in the fourth quarter. And we were ahead of delivering GPU capacity. We were at the 120 cities out of our plan of 100. And the guidance of 10% to 12% of revenue for this year includes a full build-out and bringing GPU capacity into pretty much every location we have. And on top of that, making sure that the network grows with the traffic that we put on our network. So that is, I think, one of the key competitive advantages we have is the network architecture and that's just another proof point in the fourth quarter. Regarding your question on variable revenue, variable revenue in the fourth quarter was a bit higher than it was in the third quarter, but it's still a small percentage of our overall revenue. This will change over time. As our packaging and the offerings we bring to the market will have higher variable components. But for the fourth quarter, it was still a small part of our overall revenue and revenue mix."

            "content": "Thank you, Phil. We had an exceptionally strong quarter. We achieved revenue of $362.5 million, up 32% year-over-year. We added 198 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 2,756 large customers, up 35% year-over-year. We saw particular strength in our largest customers with a record number of net new customers spending more than both $0.5 million a year and $1 million a year on an annualized basis. We signed our largest new logo with an expected total contract value over $30 million and our largest customer renewal with a total contract value of $60 million. We blew away our previous record for new ACV booked in the quarter. In Q4, new ACV booked grew nearly 40% year-over-year, making it not only our record in absolute ACV, but also the fastest percentage growth we've seen since 2021. Our pipeline closed rates sales force productivity, average steel size and linearity all improved markedly quarter-over-quarter. I continue to be encouraged by the early results we're seeing from our new sales recruiting and training programs. During the fourth quarter, the pipeline generated by the cohort under the new program was 2.1 times higher than the year ago cohort. And account engagement increased by 3.5 times compared with a year ago. I'm excited by our maturing sales execution and believe it will pay dividends in 2024 as these sales professionals fully rank. Our dollar-based net retention ticked down 1% quarter-over-quarter to 115%. Our gross margin was 78.9%, again, above our long-term target of 75% to 77% and up from 78.7% last quarter. We delivered an operating profit of $39.8 million, representing an operating margin of 11%. We also meaningfully outperformed on free cash flow generating $50.7 million during the quarter and approximately $120 million in free cash flow for the year. I'm proud of our team for their continued execution. The machine that underlies Cloudflare is firing efficiently on all cylinders, and we've been able to execute even as the macro environment remains choppy. Key to that execution has been improvement in our go-to-market efforts. 15 months ago, we brought on Marc Boroditsky to execute effectively a turnaround of Cloudflare's go-to-market team. At the time, we had enterprise customers, but we hadn't operationalized repeatedly and consistently landing them. We were also suffering from a COVID hangover and like much of the industry, have been flat on performance management. Mark changed all that. He's brought in the process and discipline we needed to be world-class in sales the same way we already were in product and engineering. It's hard to be the turned-around-guy, and we owe Mark a huge debt of gratitude for playing that role. But there's someone we always whispered about as our ideal go-to-market leader if we could ever have him as a full-time member of our team, Mark Anderson. He built Palo Alto Networks' world-class sales organization into the machine it is today. He has an incredible domain expertise and contacts in our industry. He's one of the great B2B sales software leaders. And as we were getting ready to go public, we couldn't quite commence them to run our go-to-market org, but we did the next best thing, inviting him to join our Board. Over the last four years, we've gotten to know each other on Cloudflare's Board. From there, he's provided invaluable counsel to me, Michelle and our go-to market leaders. And so after Alteryx, the company he's been running as CEO agreed to go private. He reached out and asked whether we'd be interested in not just having him as a coach, but also a player on the field, rolling up his sleeves and getting back to what he's best at. Running a world-class go-to-market organization, selling great products and delivering incredible value and support to customers. Given the deep relationship and trust we developed and his expertise and leadership in our field it was as close to a no-brainer, as I can remember in a long time. I wanted to invite Mark Anderson to the call to say a few words. Mark? Thanks, Mark. I want to again thank Marc Boroditsky for getting us to this place. We couldn't have done it without him. He will continue to be an adviser to Cloudflare for the next several months to make sure Mark Anderson is set up for success. He will always be part of the Cloudflare team, and I'm excited to hear what challenges he takes on next. I also wanted to take this time to reaffirm that Michelle and I aren't going anywhere or changing our roles in anyway. I wake up every morning more excited about the opportunities we have to fulfill our mission of helping build a better internet. If you study the iconic technology companies, they are often mission-driven, founder-led but include a dynamic and evolving leadership team surrounding the founders who bring a wealth of experience for each stage of the company's journey. That a leader like Mark Anderson can get to know us over the last four years from his seat on our Board and then choose to join our team standing side-to-side with the other senior team we have assembled gives me confidence that we're on a path to being one of the iconic technology companies ourselves. We're not there yet. So I'm not satisfied, and I remain fully committed to that journey. With that, let me walk through some of the customer wins we had in the quarter. We were awarded a three-year contract with a ceiling value of $33 million for the US Department of Commerce which will be deploying services across our SASE application performance and security solutions. We believe deals like this validate the criticality of converging application performance, security, network and Zero Trust services on a unified platform and how Cloudflare can deliver a comprehensive, commercially off-the-shelf platform from a single vendor as compared with numerous point product competitors. A leading technology company, expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year, $6.6 million contract for Cloudflare's Zero Trust Suite to protect access for 10,000 employees and contractors. Given the company's highly complex and secure environment, implementing a first-generation Zero Trust vendor proved to be a challenge. This company had done a Zero Trust RFP a year prior, but when they reviewed Cloudflare's Zero Trust solution again, they were impressed by our significant progress in innovation. Not only was our rate of innovation a key differentiator, but with Cloudflare, they are able to simplify and consolidate Zero Trust application performance and security all on a single platform. A Fortune 500 hospitality company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a five-year, $4.3 million contract for 20,000 Zero Trust seats. This company approached us 15 months ago with a basic Zero Trust use case. The scope quickly expanded from one to several as this company sought to re-architect their entire Zero Trust approach. The lack of platform integration and the absence of strategic vision from their incumbent vendors, including a first-generation Zero Trust competitor, led them to Cloudflare for our easy-to-use comprehensive platform with a cloud-first architecture. Although performance improvement was not an important consideration early on, after a six-month paid pilot, the team was blown away by how much improvement they saw with Cloudflare stating, holy bleep, I've never seen Jira go this fast. A sophisticated tech company with one of the technical and daring engineering teams signed a two-year, $646,000 contracts. The company had recently experienced a breach, driving them to increase their security posture and adopt a Zero Trust approach. This company considered nearly every relevant vendor in the market, over 13 in total, and Cloudflare and one other competitor were selected for a proof-of-concept and 30-day pilot. After just 14 days, Cloudflare was fully configured and completed all success criteria, whereas our competitor was unable to get off the ground. The ease of deployment was key for this company who needed to design a solution in a very complex environment with Cloudflare, everything worked out of the box. A Fortune 500 technology company signed a two-year $6 million contract for advanced application security. The company was experiencing an increased DDoS attacks that a large hyperscale public cloud was unable to mitigate. These unmitigated attacks created significant latency resulting in a loss of traffic and potential revenue. They view Cloudflare as the leading expert in DDoS mitigation based on our HTTP/2 rapid reset publication and the compatibility of our Layer 7 security bundle with their self-hosted technology and public cloud vendors made Cloudflare an easy choice. It's just the beginning with this customer. A large US commercial airline expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a two-year $857,000 contract to procure Zero Trust seats. A great land-and-expand example. This is the third deal we've done with this customer in 2023 as they undergo a digital transformation project. They're using our full Zero Trust suite along with application services. They love our unified network, single pane of glass and speed of implementation. A fourth deal with them is already on the horizon. A local government authority in the UK signed a five-year $2.1 million contract for 4,700 Zero Trust seats. The government authority was pursuing a very large digital transformation project to modernize and improve security posture with a complete network refresh and the adoption of Zero Trust. Following a three-year engagement process, the authority was evaluating two competing Zero Trust vendors. Cloudflare entered the process in the late stages. Cloudflare One was selected as the core component of their modernization program due to our ease of use, seamless integration and expansive platform with a single control plane. In their words \"Cloudflare is easy, it just works.\" These days, no earnings conference would be complete without an update on AI. As of the end of 2023, we deployed GPUs in 120 cities globally, meaningfully ahead of our target of 100 cities. By the end of 2024, we plan to have inference tuned GPUs deployed in nearly every city that makes up Cloudflare 's global network and within milliseconds of nearly every device connected to the Internet worldwide. The breadth and potential impact of the use cases we are seeing with workers AI are extraordinary. And we're super excited about the opportunity to establish workers' AI serverless model built on Cloudflare's trusted global network as the best infrastructure for running AI inference tasks. From our launch in September to the month of December, the average number of daily workers' AI request increased 9x. Furthermore, one-third of the thousands of workers' AI account are new to the workers' platform, suggesting that workers' AI is not just significant opportunity in and of itself, but also a potential accelerant to adoption of the workers' overall platform. Inference, however, is only part of the AI equation. We are also extremely encouraged by the interest in Vectorize, our vector database which makes it easy, fast and affordable to index and store vectors to support use cases that require access not just to running models, but customized data too, as well as AI Gateway, which gives organizations the tool to cash, rate limit and observe their AI deployments regardless of where they're running. AI on workers platform is just getting started and there are exciting things on the road map that we look forward to sharing with you in the not-so-distant future. As I reflect back on the last quarter, I'm proud of our team. It feels like we're once again firing on all cylinders, but a quarter is only one data point. As we talked about throughout the last year, the macro environment remains challenging. IT buyers are still skittish. The world is not getting any less complicated. And as a company, we still have a ton of proof. Those were the dominant themes of 2023, and I think it's likely that will remain the themes of 2024. So while I'm encouraged by our results, we continue to remain prudent and focused on disciplined execution, building and improving our team, delivering exceptional value to our customers and solving some of the hardest engineering challenges the internet faces. With that, I'll hand it over to Thomas to walk through our financials. Thomas, take it away. Yes. Thanks, Brent. I think the first thing really is what we talked a lot about on the call, which is just a real focus on go-to-market excellence and I think Marc Boroditsky, who really worked hand-in-hand with Mark Anderson on our Board, have done a great job over the last 15 months of really focusing on how we make sure that we're as great in go-to-market as we have been in product and engineering. And I think that's the biggest thing to point out. I think the second thing is that we've really seen strength in our Zero Trust and SASE products. Some of the biggest wins that we saw in the quarter were big Zero Trust deals. And I think that those products have caught up significantly. And you'll see in the Analyst Day, Industry Analyst reports and others that we're very quickly becoming one of the real leaders in that space. And I think over time, we will surpass many of the first-generation Zero Trust vendors and that really opens up another leg on the stool. And then lastly, I just continue to be really astonished by the rate at which our developer platform is growing. AI is not yet contributing materially to revenue. But it has contributed materially to developer excitement over the platform. And we're seeing more and more large deals, more and more interesting applications coming in using the workers' platform and that has gone well as well. So I think operational excellence in go-to-market, I think, that really strength around our Zero Trust products and then just continued outperformance on our developer platform. And those things all came together in Q4 of 2023. Sure. Matt, I appreciate it. So first of all, I think working with Mark Anderson has been a big piece behind the scenes of the improvements that we've seen in the go-to-market performance that we've had so far. And so his, as a Board member, his hands have been involved in a lot of the strategic decisions we've made, a lot of the focus that we've made. And so I think this is less of a radical change in terms of the strategy, and it's more of a continuation of what we have done. That said, I think that the thing which Mark brings, which is unique and as we thought of who would be our ideal sales leader, and we really started thinking about that before we went public. Mark was top of the list because of the domain expertise, because of the relationships that he has, because of the trust that he's built in the industry. And because of the other sales professionals that really have worked with him and want to follow him and have their own, again, expertise and relationships in the industry as well. And so I think that Mark Anderson will continue a lot of what Marc Boroditsky has done, continue to professionalize our organization, continue to move up market, continue to really focus on rep productivity, focus on making sure that we have all of the right training, all of the right ramping resources that reps need focused on making sure that our sales process is as efficient as possible. And I think that will be a big piece of what he is delivering. I think if you zoom out from that, the other thing which is a big initiative for us is just looking at our overall platform and saying, how can we make it actually much easier, not only for our internal team to sell, but also for partners to sell as well. Right now, we have a ton of different products. And I think bringing that together and finding ways to really make that, those products, not just individual products, but as a platform and an overall platform that's where we tend to win is when people buy that overall platform. And that's where there really isn't a ton of competition when people are comparing the total platform that Cloudflare offers versus anyone else in the space. We are able to deliver a much more robust network security, performance, reliability package than any other vendor that's in that space. And I think Mark helps us deliver that and continue again on some of the great work that Marc Boroditsky had started and really set him up for success. Yes, Andy. I think that, first of all, the -- we didn't start out as a company that had a Zero Trust platform. And so that's something that was a very natural add-on to our network. We think it's very complementary with the other services that we offer. And I think that as we studied the industry and studied the space, it was clear that this set of solutions ended up squarely in our bailiwick of what it was that we were delivering. And so that I think that, that was a very natural place, but we are new to this space. And things take time and especially in the larger buyers, they want validation like Gartner and Forrester and other industry analysts saying that you should be in the consideration set. And so there's a bit of a chicken and egg issue where you have to sort of start to get your first large customers and your early adopters in order for the Gartners and Forresters to put you in consideration. And then from that, you start to build that reputation with the industry analysts, and that gets you in more deals. And what we find is when we're in the consideration set, we're just a next-generation platform, and we're faster, we're more secure, we're more reliable, and we're a better solution for a lot of vendors. And so not only are we winning the greenfield opportunities, but we're increasingly winning opportunities from first-generation Zero Trust vendors where their customers aren't satisfied with the solutions they have and they're moving fully to us. So I think that a lot of it has been just the maturing of our platform, but not just from a technology perspective, we're pretty good at that, and we have a lot of control of that. But also just from an understanding in the industry that this is something that we offer. An understanding of how the various components of Cloudflare fit well together. And I think that, that's something that becomes itself a flywheel which we expect will continue to deliver success for us in this space over time. Yes. The way that we see, the space in general is we want to have all of the different components that you need in order to build just a full-featured AI application. And that means supporting as many models as possible and some of the work that we're doing with the major model vendors like the Metas of the World, the marketplaces like Hugging Face gives us that. We want to have the best place for inference and we think that we're Goldilocks in that space, where the centralized public clouds are too far away and your device that you're holding in your hand or wearing on your wrist is often doesn't have enough power. But where we are sitting in between gives that really incredible place for inference. But then the next step of that is you have to be able to take those models and make them your own. And that's exactly what Vectorize does. It allows you to customize those models and tune them, the fine-tuning around making them your own. And so what's been interesting about that is that being local and having presence all around the world ends up mattering in various places, an example that a customer gave us the other day was that if you have a model and it responds in the United States and it sells color, C-O-L-O-U-R, it feels very foreign, whereas if it's in the UK and it spells as C-O-L-O-R, it also feels very foreign. And so the ability to not just tune models, but tune them locally, while still having the power of beefy GPUs that can then run the inference task. That's a really killer combination. And as you said, it's built on top of the existing primitives that we have, including R2 which is our object storage space. And so while it's early in the entire AI space. I think we are very well positioned and very strategic. And if you look at things like the various downloads of our libraries, on public -- open source repos, they are taking off like crazy. And it is incredibly encouraging and I think will become a larger and larger part of our business going forward. Yes. So I'll take the first question and Thomas can take the second. I'll start with -- in a place that you might not expect, which is our success in the Zero Trust market has actually helped empower our ability to invest in the developer platform and especially the AI market. To understand that, the nature of how our business works is that every single service that we run is capable of running on every single piece of equipment that's out there. So we don't run a different network for our security products than we do for our performance products. We don't run a different network for the CASB service that we have versus our access versus our DDoS mitigation, it's all the same machines that are running across that. And so one of the secrets to Cloudflare's success has been that we've been able to always look for places where there is more sort of unused capacity and then effectively act as a giant scheduler in order to make that capacity more productive. And what's been interesting about the Zero Trust space is that the very nature of how that traffic works, where our first-generation services were all reverse proxy services. The traffic was flowing kind of in one direction, whereas our Zero Trust services are all what's called forward proxy services, the traffic is flowing in the other. But it turns out that you can actually have traffic flow both directions without having additional CapEx cost. And so as a bigger and bigger part of our revenue is the Zero Trust products, it means that it actually frees up CapEx as a percentage of revenue for us to go after other opportunities. And so that's what has freed up us to go after a lot of the AI opportunities that we've had. It was freed up our ability to acquire the GPUs and invest behind the demand that we're seeing. And I feel really good because at core, what we are really good at is running a giant network, as a giant scheduler and then wringing as much efficiency and utilization out of that as possible. And so we have been able to stay ahead of the demand that we've seen for the GPUs and other resources that we need for some of these newer products. And we are complementing that by also adding revenue, which is just much less CapEx efficient because it's much less CapEx intensive and much more CapEx efficient because it's running on top of the same platform. Hopefully, that makes sense. But it really is part of the key to our business. And it's part of why we have the gross margins that we do where some of the other companies that are point solutions only doing one of these things have much worse margin profiles. Yes, I think that if you study developer platforms, they inherently take some time to really take off and take hold. And it averages about 10 years from when they launch before they seem like they're getting to that. And the reason for that is because of the fact that you need early adopters, those early adopters need to build something, which is a killer app, which people say, wow, I couldn't have built that in any other way. Some of the people who are behind that first killer app need to then go on and start other services, other companies, build other things. There's an ecosystem that has to develop around all of that. And that inherently takes some time to take off. Developer platforms are adopted. They're not sold. And so again, I think that we've been very excited about the rate at which things have been adopted at Cloudflare for our developer platform, but we've also been realistic that for that developer platform to take off, inherent in how these develop, there is some time. There are a handful of ways that you can have shortcuts. One of those is to attach yourself to other developer ecosystems, which are really robust. And so some of the ways that we are effectively providing the underlying infrastructure for some major other platforms that are out there, a number of the big e-commerce platforms and other things. That helps train developers early on how to build with us and again is one of the shortcuts to get there. Another one is attaching yourself to wherever there is a lot of interest in the developer ecosystem. And so I think that as you look out at the AI space and we try to survey what are the most common cloud platforms that are being used across the hottest AI start-ups and companies that are out there. Cloudflare is the most common to that. And I think that again accelerates the rate at which you're able to get that adoption. And so if you look at things like NPM downloads of packages and you compare sort of the things that you would download to run on Cloudflare workers versus competitors like AWS' serverless offering. It's been pretty amazing that we've actually caught and now passed AWS by some measures in terms of the packages which are being downloaded that are out there. And again, we're a much newer platform. And so I'm encouraged that we'll be hopefully taking that average time for new developer platforms to get reach scale down because of some of the success we've seen and again I'm really proud of our team and how they've executed in delivering this. Yes. I think what has been interesting has been that workers is a big piece of a lot of the deals that we see. So it's still in somewhere around 20% of the large deals that we closed, have some workers component to it. And that's held actually fairly steady, but those deals have continued to go up and up. So it depends on how. We don't break out the various pieces of Cloudflare because we think that the platform functions very well as one unified platform. And we close more deals because we have workers involved. But a lot of times, that includes our reverse proxy security services oftentimes includes our Zero Trust security services. And what we really want to be is not a one-trick pony for any one of our customers. We want to actually have multiple different things that they rely on and be that strategic vendor that provides a broad set of solutions to them. So I think it's already materially driving new business and large deals. But as the workers platform, I think the AI space, I think a lot of the money, which is being spent on AI right now, especially with some of the hyperscale public cloud. A lot of that is for training of models that is not -- we are not the right place to actually do model training. But as that transitions over time and people start to figure out how can you take those -- the models that you've built and turn them into real products. I think that's where you'll start to see a much more significant share of -- you'll start to see revenue that is showing up is meaningful to us in terms of delivering the value in the AI space. But I think it's -- we're still so early. And I think that the thing to track is less about us. It's more about how long does it take product managers and engineers to really figure out how to harness these new tools into providing customer value. I think we've seen a ton of -- I mean, the challenging thing with AI is it is really easy to make a demo, but it's very hard to make a product. There's a ton of value that will be created here, but I think it's going to still take some time. And I think it's going to be up to some things that are somewhat out of our control. But I can't imagine being better positioned than we are. Yeah, so I think our strategy remains our strategy, which is land with one product and then demonstrate, build trust, demonstrate value and then expand to help customers both create more value and save money across their overall all platform. And what we see over and over again is that the customer that just this last quarter signed a $60 million total contract value renewal. They started with one product and we're a $60,000 customer a year when they first started. So that works. I think operationalizing that now is the thing which we've made huge strides on over the last 15 months and I think Mark Anderson will continue to help with that. What I think is really attractive about Mark Anderson is, yes, he knows the security space and the network security space from his time at Palo Alto Networks, but also from his time at Palo Alto Networks, they went from really a one product company to a platform company. And that's something which we really admire and think is rare when companies figure out that play. We've got that set of products. We've got a lot of customers. And now it's how do we, again, continue to demonstrate value, I think, bringing on incredibly talented leaders like Mark Anderson, who are trusted and respected in the space who have run this play before and been successful with it, and it can now take the breadth of products that we have and the opportunity we have and build an iconic company and an iconic go-to-market organization. Again, I'm incredibly honored to have him on board, and his first day was today, and he's already rolling up his sleeves and getting to work. Yes, so sort of related questions, actually. I think that our federal business as well as our SLED business state, local education, and our global government business has all been real signs of strength. And I think that, in part, is because of the fact that the world is getting scarier and we're seeing more attacks. In 2022, it was actually very quiet on the cyber front, whereas the back half of 2023 and especially after the Hamas invasion and kidnappings in Israel really took off in terms of cyber-attacks that were going on around the world. And I think governments recognize the importance of staying safe and secure. More than half of the world's population will vote in 2023 in elections. And so I think the fact that we've been leaders in protecting elections and making sure that elections are run without cybersecurity being part of the story has gotten us in the conversation in a lot of places around the world. And I think that we have a maturing set of just go-to-market motions and a really great leadership team around our state and local business or excuse me our federal and state business, which is showing real signs of promise. So I would expect that, that business continues to be strong throughout 2024. Your second question is kind of the flip side of that, which is I think that the macro continues to be challenging. There are two hot wars going on right now. I think we are not out of the woods economically in terms of getting totally ahead of inflation. Again, I think in the US that looks better than some of the other places in the world. There's a lot of ways that you can imagine the world continues to get more complicated. And I think IT buyers continue to be skittish. Q4 definitely felt like people were starting to make decisions, and they were starting to say that there are certain things that are must-have versus nice-to-have. And I think we continue to be sorted into the must-have bucket. But we continue to be very prudent and very thoughtful as we think about our business, we're trying to scale behind the demand that we see, not get cocky about ramping anything too fast. But in a world that is increasingly difficult and increasingly complicated, I'm glad that we're in the business of helping provide cybersecurity, and I'm incredibly proud of our team for living up to our mission of helping make sure the internet stays safe, secure and reliable. I just wanted to thank the entire Cloudflare team for just all the incredibly hard work over Q4 and into the beginning of 2024. And we were just so incredibly proud of the work that everyone is doing. I'm excited to add Mark Anderson to our team full time. He started actually today, as I said, and he's already rolling up his sleeve. I want to thank Marc Boroditsky, who will continue to act as an Advisor to Cloudflare and help with the transition. He's been nothing but a class act throughout this and we couldn't have gotten here. Thanks to all of our customers, investors, we'll see you back here in about three months. Thank you."

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. We had another strong quarter in spite of an increasingly uncertain world. In Q3, we achieved revenue of $335.6 million up 32% year-over-year. We added 206 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, and now have 2,558 large customers, up 34% year-over-year. Looking at even larger customers, we added a record number of net new customers year-over-year spending more than both $500,000 and $1 million per year with Cloudflare. Our dollar-based net retention ticked up 1% to 116%. We see this as a lagging indicator and expect that it will take some time for the go-to-market improvements we're seeing across our team to be fully reflected. During the quarter, we continued to refine these go-to-market strategies. Our pipeline close rates held steady, our sales force productivity remained constant and linearity was similar to Q2. I think that we have been able to hold things steady while making significant organizational changes and improvements across our sales and marketing organization is very encouraging. Beyond that, we're beginning to see positive early signs from the sales team members we've brought on over the six months to replace underperformers. During the quarter, the pipeline generated by this new cohort was 1.6x higher than those brought on at the same time a year earlier. These new account executives achieved more than 130% of their activity goals for the quarter. That's great news. And we're thrilled to have them on board. And while they're still ramping, I'm encouraged by the performance, and that we've been able to revamp as much of our sales team as we have without significant disruption. Our gross margin was 78.7%, still well above our target range of 75% to 77%, and up from 77.7% last quarter. We delivered an operating profit of $42.5 million, our fifth consecutive record quarter for the company. This represents an operating margin of 12.7%. Operating profit increased nearly 3x year-over-year, underscoring our commitment to operating efficiency and productivity. We continue to generate positive free cash flow. In Q3, we generated $34.9 million during the quarter, representing a free cash flow margin of 10.4%. This is a business that can generate significant cash, and in 2023, we expect we will generate more than $100 million in free cash flow, well ahead of our original goal when we started the year, and the direct result of improved execution across our entire business. In Q3, we celebrated our 13th anniversary of Cloudflare's launch, a time we call Birthday Week. We officially entered our teenage years and like many kids, it took us a while to fully understand and articulate the category we belong to. The day before our 13th birthday, we announced to the world, that we realized what we are, a connectivity cloud. Connectivity means we measure ourselves by connecting people and things together. Cloud means the batteries are included. It scales with you. It's programmable, has consistent security built in, it's intelligent and learns from your usage and others to optimize for outcomes better than you could on your own. Our connectivity cloud is worth contrasting against some of the other first-generation clouds. The hyperscale public clouds are, in many ways, the opposite. They optimize for hoarding your data, locking it in, making it difficult to move. They are captivity cloud. While they may be great for some things, their full potential is only truly unlocked for customers when combined with the connectivity cloud that lets you mix and match the best of each of their features. That's what we hear from customers, that they are multicloud, whether they want to be or not. And that's what they really need, is a connectivity cloud, to hook all their systems together in a fast, secure, reliable way. The messaging of the connectivity cloud is resonating with customers and helping them understand the full extent of what Cloudflare is able to deliver for them. We are not any one of our individual features or even as some of them. We are a cloud that helps you get the most out of connectivity, and customers love that and are leaning into it. Speaking of customers, we've had some great customer wins in the quarter I'd like to highlight. A U.S. government cabinet level agency within the executive branch, signed a one-year $2 million contract. Cloudflare's replacing three point solution vendors, including a 20-year old incumbent solution. We're providing a unified application security for 600 U.S. government applications. They were drawn to Cloudflare's modern architecture, rate of innovation, robust network and ability to reduce complexity by consolidating multiple point solutions into a single pane of glass. Another U.S. government agency signed a one year $510,000 contract for Cloudflare's Zero Trust solutions, including Access, Gateway, Browser Isolation and Data Loss Prevention. We were selected over first-generation Zero Trust competitors due to our ability to consolidate numerous products across both application security and Zero Trust onto a single platform. Our federal business has grown significantly over the last year, and we believe these deals are just at the tip of the iceberg with both of these customers, which we expect can expand significantly. A leading health care company signed a three year $1 million contract for Cloudflare's Zero Trust solutions, including Access, Gateway, Browser Isolation and Area 1 Email Security. They are a legacy vendor looking to modernize their security posture as they migrate on-prem applications to the cloud. They experienced a sophisticated e-mail phishing attack mid-process, and with Area 1, we were able to immediately protect them. They chose us over first-generation Zero Trust solutions because of the comprehensiveness of our solution, including e-mail security. The VP of Technology said succinctly, we should have partnered with Cloudflare earlier. A major European consulting company signed a three year $1.6 million contract for Access and Gateway, along with Magic WAN and our data localization suite. They selected Cloudflare over first-generation Zero Trust competitors because of the breadth of our platform. The theme across these examples is customers are looking for a Zero Trust solution, increasingly wanting to protect their entire network. Cloudflare is the only vendor that can deliver a comprehensive network-wide solution from a single vendor. Switching gears a bit, a Fortune 500 semiconductor company expanded their relationship to Cloudflare, signing a three year $1.4 million contract. The customer was looking to modernize their network security posture. They adopted our Magic Transit product. They were able to consolidate multiple point solutions on to Cloudflare's unified platform. An African public utility company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a four year $3 million contract. This company first approached Cloudflare last year, facing multiple under attack situations. We onboarded the customer with Application Security and Magic Transit, stopping the attacks they were seeing. The customer was so impressed with Cloudflare's products and performance that they quadrupled their utilization and added additional products, including Magic Firewall. The fact that Cloudflare's network spans the globe gives us the ability to service clients everywhere. Another international technology company signed a two year $1.8 million contract for Magic Transit and Advanced Application Security. This customer approached us in the midst of a large-scale DDoS attack. Their incumbent solutions were provided by a mix of point solutions and bundled hyperscale cloud mitigation services, neither was sufficient to stay ahead of the attack. In Q3, we saw a significant increase in massive DDoS attacks. To give you a sense, these new attacks are generating nearly as much traffic as the entire Internet generates globally, but pointing it to a single victim. There are very few networks that can stand up to these attacks. I'm proud of the fact that Cloudflare is architected uniquely for this moment. And as the world becomes more complicated, and these attacks become more common, I think more and more of the Internet will turn to us for protection. A leading ad tech company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year $720,000 contract. This customer came to us with a technical workers use case. They needed a platform that could help them deliver through traffic spikes, up to 3 million requests per second. Their existing solutions on traditional hyperscale public clouds were expensive to maintain and would encounter errors with even relatively low traffic spikes. Cloudflare Workers was able to support their needs without bringing a sweat. With this win, we expect they will move more of their applications to our much easier to scale platform. A Fortune 500 technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year $2.9 million contract. This customer approached us to use our connectivity cloud to help them collect AI and machine learning data from their customers, while maintaining the highest level of privacy. They view Cloudflare as a leader in privacy, and we work closely with them to develop the solution. This deal makes clear the importance of privacy and the likely regulatory scrutiny of AI tasks and highlights how Cloudflare's network, which extends into the vast majority of countries on earth, can help customers take advantage of AI while complying with an increasingly complex regulatory environment. We continue to accelerate our efforts in AI. We believe Cloudflare is the most common cloud provider used by the leading AI companies. During our birthday celebrations in Q3, we made several announcements with companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta, Hugging Face and Databricks. We also announced Workers AI to put powerful AI inference within milliseconds of every Internet user. We believe inference is the biggest opportunity in AI and inference tasks will largely be run on end devices and connectivity clouds like Cloudflare. Right now, there are members of the Cloudflare team traveling the world with suitcases full of GPUs, installing them throughout our network. We have inference-optimized GPUs running in 75 cities worldwide as of the end of October, we are well on our way of hitting a goal of 100 by the end of 2023. By the end of 2024, we expect to have inference-optimized GPUs running in nearly every location where Cloudflare operates worldwide, making us easily the most widely distributed cloud-AI inference platform. We've been planning for this for the last six years, expecting that at some point, we hit the crossover, where deploying inference-optimized GPUs made sense. To that end, starting six years ago, we intentionally left one or more PCI slots in every server we built, empty. When the demand and the technology made sense, we started deploying. That means we can use our existing server infrastructure and just add GPU cards, allowing us to add this capability while still staying within our forecast CapEx envelope. And customers are excited. In the five weeks since our AI announcement, thousands of developers have leveraged our new AI capabilities to build full stack AI applications on Cloudflare's network, processing more than 18 million request through the new features we launched just over a month ago. The demand has exceeded our expectations and continued to accelerate, increasing 5x since mid-October. We have a pipeline of customers interested in putting hundreds of billions of inference tasks on our infrastructure each month. It's early days but the interest we're seeing from customers, large and small, over what they can build with powerful inference capabilities now embedded in one of the world's largest networks is inspiring. They like how easy it is to use Workers AI. They like how it's powerful, but close to their users around the world. They like the more efficient and fair pricing model, our serverless implementation delevers. And they like the flexibility of bringing their own models or fine-tuning existing models using the tools that are included as part of Workers AI. If we're right, that inference is the big AI opportunity, and that inference tasks that are too big and too complex to run on end devices, will need to run as close to the user as possible, then we've got a head start on building the preferred location for inference for the most interesting AI applications of the future. Finally, before I turn it over to Thomas, I wanted to acknowledge that we continue to live in very challenging times. The war in Ukraine continues unabated. Now we have a new war in the Middle East after the attack by Hamas on Israel. We have colleagues in the region who have been impacted directly and indirectly. Our thoughts are with them. And while we see the devastating images of the kinetic war, the online war is also raging. Cloudflare is committed to providing our services to humanitarian and civil society organizations at no cost, to ensure they can continue doing their important work for all those impacted by the increasingly hostile world we find ourselves in. In our business, we need to stay on top of cybersecurity issues globally and modern warfare continues to include the cyber battlefield. As I look back on the quarter, I'd like to thank our entire team at Cloudflare for all your hard work, innovation, dedication to supporting our customers and the greater Internet. Thank you for continuing to help build a better Internet for us all. And with that, I'll hand it off to Thomas. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. During the third quarter, as we continue to refine our go-to-market strategies and operations, our pipeline growth rates have held steady, our productivity remained consistent and linearity was similar to last quarter. We are pleased to see significant growth with general partners, momentum with large customers and strength in the public sector. Importantly, we continue to maintain our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible, and as good stewards of investors' capital. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of record operating profit, increasing nearly threefold year-over-year and significantly outperformed on free cash flow. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 32% year-over-year to $335.6 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 30% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 36% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 27% year-over-year. Turning to our customer metrics. In the third quarter, we had 182,027 paying customers, representing an increase of 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 2,558 large customers, representing an increase of 34% year-over-year, and an addition of 206 large customers in the quarter. In fact, we added a record number of net new customers year-over-year spending more than $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 116% during the third quarter, representing an increase of 100 basis points sequentially. Also, there can be some variability in this metric quarter-to-quarter, we continue to believe the recent decelerating trend in DNR, stabilizing near lease levels. Moving to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin was 78.7%, representing an increase of 100 basis points sequentially, and an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 8% of revenue in the third quarter as we continue to benefit from our focus on driving greater efficiency from our infrastructure and the uniqueness of our platform to onboard new workloads. Despite having begun to invest in the enormous AI opportunity in front of us, with the planned rollout of GPUs to more than 100 cities by the end of this year, we expect network CapEx to be 8% to 10% of revenue in fiscal 2023. However, we anticipate network CapEx to return to more normalized levels over time. Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 5% sequentially and decreased by 6% year-over-year to 66%. Our total number of employees increased 11% year-over-year, bringing our total head count to 3,529 at the end of the quarter. We were selective in hiring during the quarter, as we continue to evaluate deploying AI and automation at scale to reengineer our business processes across the company. Early investments in these areas are already delivering encouraging returns. We will remain prudent in hiring as we continue to invest in broadening and deepening the usage of AI and automation across our operations to drive higher productivity and greater efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses were $129 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3% sequentially and decreased 38% from 41% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $54.2 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1% sequentially and decreased to 16% from 18% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $38.5 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2% sequentially and decreased 11% from 13% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $42.5 million compared to $14.8 million in the same period last year. Third quarter operating margin was 12.7%, an increase of 690 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our ongoing focus on becoming more productive and doing more with less, given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $55.3 million or a diluted net income per share of $0.16. We ended the third quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $34.9 million in the third quarter or 10% of revenue, compared to negative $4.6 million or 2% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $1.1 billion, representing an increase of 5% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. With broadening geopolitical uncertainty and increasingly mixed macroeconomic data points across geographies, the business environment in which we operate remains challenging to predict. And as a result, we continue to remain prudent and cautious in our outlook for the fourth quarter. Now turning to guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $352 million to $353 million, representing an increase of 28% to 29% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $28 million to $29 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 7%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.12, assuming approximately 354 million shares outstanding. Please note that our share count guidance now includes dilution from our convertible senior notes of approximately 6.8 million shares, given that Cloudflare has achieved a level of profitability whereby these securities are no longer deemed and be diluted. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.286 billion to $1.287 billion, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $110 million to $111 million, and we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.45 to $0.46, assuming approximately 350 million shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 8% for 2023. After having achieved significant free cash flow in the first three quarters of the year, we expect to generate over $100 million in free cash flow for the full year 2023. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission, as well as our customers, for trusting us to help them solve some of the hardest problems that they face when modernizing and transforming their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Congrats on the results. Matthew, for you, a lot of exciting news at Birthday Week, including Workers AI and everything else that you guys announced. I guess, broadly speaking, given the focus on [technical difficulty] and all the investments this year and next year, how should we expect to see some of the monetization benefits of generative AI customer spend. Is that something that you'd be able to quantify at some point? Or what are some of the breadcrumbs that we should watch for success there?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think that there are a couple of different areas where we're monetizing, and that's starting to show up in the results. And then there are a couple of areas where I think there's a longer time horizon and we're really optimizing for adoption. I think the place where we've been positively surprised is with our R2 product. R2 is our object store, and critically, it allows customers to be multi-cloud and to easily move data to wherever - they're - the resources that they need without charging them an egress tax like some of the other traditional hyperscale public clouds do. That's a place where a lot of the growth that we're seeing is coming from AI companies. They love the fact that they can take their data and their training sets and move it to wherever they are GPUs that are available around the world. And that's driving, and I think as we see more and more usage of that, that's driving revenue for us that we're realizing today. And I think that will be something that will go forward into the quarters to come. I think that some of the areas around inference, it's early days, but I think that you - I think you'd be likely to hear us start talking about larger customers that are moving significant workloads over to the AI space. I think that the individual developers will be - we're really going to optimize in that space for adoption, and building out an ecosystem. But as you hear us on earnings calls to come, talk about how people have really moved workloads, and we've got customers in the pipeline that are talking about moving billions of inference events per month to our network. That's when that starts to turn into real revenue for us. And I think it's early days, so we don't know exactly what the time frame on that will be, but the conversations we're having are very exciting, and it's a space that I'm definitely bullish on.\nMatt Hedberg: Super exciting. And then maybe, Thomas, for you. We still have Q4 to close out here and you didn't really talk about next year. But given some of the uncertainty out there, you guys are still delivering good results. Are there any building blocks that you'd share as we start to think about or fine-tune our calendar '24, either growth or profitability estimates?\nThomas Seifert: Well, we won't talk too much about '24 on this earnings call, you might expect there will be time for that on our next earnings call. But I think it's important in mind, to keep in mind that we've been talking about how cascading the impacts are in terms of the progress we make and when it hits our books, right? It's all about building pipeline first, and we have seen strength there in the third quarter, continued in the fourth quarter. How this turns into ACV? This is where uncertainty is. And once it hits ACV, it will take a turn of four quarters before it shows up into revenue. So we have seen good targets, especially at the beginning of this cascade. And as we move through that waterfall of progress, you'll see results showing up in our numbers in next year.\nMatt Hedberg: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Matthew, you've highlighted sales efficiency as one of the top goals for this year. I think Thomas mentioned it was staying consistent or maybe you had mentioned this in linearity, was pretty steady. I guess you mentioned some of the sales improvements. But where do you stand in terms of your overall game plan on the go-to-market? How far are you through this process and kind of what's left? Is there an easy way to frame this move?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So we've talked about how on previous calls, we really looked across our go-to-market functions and recognize that there was an opportunity for us to improve. And what I'm proud of is that we haven't waffled on that path. We haven't changed course. We haven't had significant disruption or distraction as we've gone through that. And I think that the caliber and quality of the people that we're bringing on to those go-to-market teams, the early indications are, and again, they're still ramping, but the early indications are that they're doing a significantly stronger job and they're delivering real results. So that's a process, and it takes time to work through that. But I think that we're seeing positive indication. I think we're being, we don't want to lose our marbles and be too aggressive, but we're being very disciplined. And one of the things I remember, what we've always talked about is how we've had a business where we invest behind the demand that we see. And I think the same thing is true on the go-to-market side, where we're seeing that the increased rigor and increased discipline has early signs of paying off. And if that continues and we get more data points along the way, then that's a place where we'll be able to invest with, again, new leadership in place and new training and enablement for our sales team. And again, I think we have - it's early still, but I think that we have good indication, and I'm proud of the fact that we did this so far without significant disruption or distraction within our business.\nBrent Thill: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for taking my question. Thomas, one for you. It's a good segue from the last question. Clearly, outperforming on the gross margin and on the operating margin side and frankly, cash flow. Just how are you going to continue to balance profitability and invest in some of these high-growth areas that Matthew outlined? Just, I'd love like some color there. Thanks.\nThomas Seifert: Yes. Just following up on what Matthew said. I think we have the business really well instrumented. And you could see this now managing ourselves through quite some macroeconomic turbulences. So the business is well instrumented. The business model is still in a way that it allows us to have visibility when demand picks up and we will invest behind the demand. We've also realized that there is significant scalability and efficiency in the business model. This is what you are - what has been showing up in the financial numbers over the last a couple of quarters really well. So I think the combination of visibility into - is that picking up or not, a well-instrumented business and a lot of elasticity in how we move forward, keeps us confident that we have their hands firm on the rudder, and can control the ramp up really well.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. Congrats on another amazing quarter, please accept my thoughts and prayers for your employees that are affected by the terrorists attack in Israel. So I wanted to ask you guys about the Workers AI offering that you launched, I think it's really interesting. I was wondering what the early feedback is on it, in particular, the vector database component. And whether the staggered rollout of the GPUs is a potential gating factor, as people kind of wait - maybe to deploy that at scale, or wait for the rollout of the NVIDIA GPUs before rolling out at scale.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Andy, thanks for the question. Again, it's an area that we're extremely excited about. I'm proud of the fact that our team has been able to get it rolled out as quickly as they have, our - we thought it was an ambitious goal to be in 100 cities by the end of the year. The fact that we're in, now over 75 today, and that we've been able to deliver that while staying very disciplined around CapEx is important. We're not seeing that people are waiting for things to be everywhere, for them to be in and testing. I do think that as we are going into various geographies around the world, it creates a real differentiation with us. We're hearing especially in markets outside of the United States, how they have felt left behind in the AI space. And increasingly, I think as you're seeing with the executive order on AI, with some of the European regulation on AI, being able to keep AI local is, we think, going to be something that's a real differentiation for us. The vector database, I think that's actually a good question to ask about and sort of got lost in some of the other stories, but I think some of the more sort of people who are paying attention within the AI space, recognize how important that is, being able to fine-tune your models and have a database that's built on top of the existing R2 infrastructure that we have, is something that not only allows us to do inference, but actually allows us to do fine-tuning as well, which gives us sort of two of the three major legs of the AI stool. And that's sort of my sneaky feature that I think is going to be pretty disruptive because you can use our vector database, whether you're using the rest of Cloudflare's AI systems, becomes a really great function for AI users, who are wanting to do fine tuning. And that, combined with the locality that we can deliver with the Workers AI system and inference scattered around, the entire world allows us to do something that is truly a complete AI ecosystem. And again, the AI developers that are paying attention, asked the same question, which is, Wow, how did you guys added vector database? And the good news is, again, all of these things are built on a lot of the primitives that we had before. We did have to go out and build something new. We can put GPUs in our existing servers. We could build sectorize the vector database on top of R2 and some of the other primitives that we had out there. And we could learn from the huge number of AI startups that are already using Cloudflare, in terms of what tools they needed in their tool kit, and that's what our team is delivering.\nAndrew Nowinski: That's great. Thanks Matt. Keep up the good work \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the solid result, in what's been a pretty tough environment. Matthew, just you talked a lot about the AI inference opportunity and a lot of great color there. Could you just maybe level set and remind us of all the different sort of vectors for potential monetization over time? You talked about R2, potentially the vector database angle as well. But any others that we should consider? And then maybe a follow-up for Thomas. I believe a lot of this is sort of priced on a more consumption basis. So as the demand starts to ramp, should we start to see that more in real-time fashion as it relates to your revenue? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, I'll start and then Thomas can add to it. I think there are three different areas in which we can see growth and delivery from AI. The one where, we've seen it now, for at least the last 18 months, is just in our traditional products, using Cloudflare's security services to protect AI systems is absolutely critical. And as you go to some of the leading AI platforms that are out there, you'll often see Cloudflare's logo where we're using AI systems ourselves actually, to check to make sure you're a human being. Check to make sure that you're not a threat before letting you on. So that's - that, I think, is just our bread and butter, and what we can deliver very efficiently. The second area is with things like R2 and charging for storage. And again, that's going to be storing the models, storing the training sets for those models, using the fine-tuning data with R2 and vectorized to be able to process those models. And again, that's going to be much more like a - as you said, a consumption-based approach. And then the third way is that we're charging for inference. And what I think is unique about us, is because at core Cloudflare's incredibly good as a routing and scheduling engine, that's how we're able to deliver the very high gross margins that we have compared with some others in the space, is that we just get a much higher degree of utilization, and we pass that on to our customers. And in this case, the way that we're charging for our GPUs is termed by the industry as a serverless method of charging. And what that means is we only charge you for when you're actually running an inference task. And then we're able to schedule that very effectively across our entire platform. And we think that, that's going to be very -- as disruptive in this space as some of the things that we've done with Workers have been -- in the traditional space. And that's something that is very attractive to AI developers. So I think those are the three ways that we see as monetization around this. One is, our -- just traditional security products. Second is around storage of either training sets or models themselves, or the refining and fine-tuning model systems? Or then the third is, actually charging for what is effectively to compute capacity and doing that in a way that is, again, very disruptive, compared with some of the other providers that are in the space. And we can often decrease people's inference task costs pretty substantially, while that's still being a very high-margin business for us. So we're excited.\nThomas Seifert: Coming back to your second question. So today, the share of variable revenue - of our overall revenue is very, very low. But the ramp of the AI service and products that Matt has just mentioned, would increase this share. We've seen some of the strength actually in the third quarter from a revenue perspective already coming from variable revenue. So this is one data point. It's not enough to make a good correlation or a trend. But with a higher share of variable, with products and services that are price variable, you would see a more immediate impact on revenue for sure. But we don't have enough data yet to see how this will play out, but the first signs are encouraging.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJames Fish: Hi guys. Thanks for the question. You guys have talked a lot about AI here, but where are we with getting more shots on goal with more of the wave 2 products in network security, and particularly -- additionally, Thomas, more for you, well, net new customers were good. The dollars added just were a little bit lower than what we've seen in past few quarters. Is that just seeing a reduction in contract durations given the macro, or what other aspects are impacting this? And I'm sorry if I missed this, did you give an RPO number this quarter?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Jim, so I'll take the first bit and then hand it off to Thomas for the second bit. I think we're seeing real strength around the network security and our Zero Trust products. We've been recognized as leaders in those spaces by a number of the key analysts. That's driven up the amount of interest. The pipeline for those products is extremely strong. And what we're seeing is that, increasingly, customers want -- especially in the sort of making every IT dollar go further, increasingly, they want to say, I don't just want to protect the back door of my business. I want to protect the front door, the back door, the side door and all of the doors in the business. And so we're the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass. And I think that, that comes through in a lot of customer examples and stories that we've seen. And so what we're seeing more and more is, people want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that's driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.\nThomas Seifert: RPO for the third quarter was $1.83 billion. I think it was part of my script. Expansion is getting better, DNR ticked up 1 percentage point. So it's stabilizing. I think that is what we have been talking about in the previous earnings call that we see bottoming out. But I would still say that it is easier to have new logo acquisition than it is to expand with existing customers. And the trend we have seen that this might be impacted, timing-wise or budget-wise, by current macro concerns, I think still holds true. It has not changed materially from the third quarter - from the second quarter.\nJames Fish: Awesome. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari from Baird. Please go ahead.\nShrenik Kothari: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the solid execution. I'd just like to switch gears a little bit to DDoS. So Matthew, I mean, of course, Cloudflare's unique approach to DDoS pricing, definitely differs from the competition? And instead of tying the price to the size of the attack, you've opted for kind of a more customer-centric approach. So just curious in today's elevated DDoS landscape, are you seeing the flexibility kind of appreciated by customers and not being charged based on the scale of the attack. Is it becoming a key driver for kind of stronger share gains? And then I have a quick follow-up for Thomas?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So first of all, I mean, the world is getting a lot more complicated, and we're seeing even nation state actors turning to DDoS attacks to disrupt services around the world, and a new attack vector, which our team alongside Google and AWS helped discover and announced this last quarter, is generating attacks that are, I mean, literally almost doubling the total volume of traffic on the entire Internet when they're going forward. And the nature of how we're able to stop those attacks and the architecture of how we're able to stop those attacks is very unique to Cloudflare. And we're seeing even some of the large hyperscale public clouds that have their own limited DDoS mitigation services point customers to us, because we're the best in the world at this. And I think that, that's a real differentiator for us. The pricing also is important. And what's unique is because every single server that is part of Cloudflare's network can run every single service. As we stop these massive attacks, not only are we, again, better able to technically stop them, but we are then able to do it without changing our underlying pricing because it doesn't drive up what our costs are. Early on, we said that we should pass that advantage on to our customers. And so we created pricing that was, as you said, very customer-centric that's appreciated by the market. I think more and more people are leaning in on DDoS and using us for that. And what we're seeing is that, then we can use that as sort of the milk in the grocery store where we can sell other products across our suite. And just like I said before, customers don't just want to protect the front door. They don't just want to protect the back door. They want to protect all of the parts of our business. And so we're seeing that having collective solutions from a platform that can solve DDoS, Zero Trust, WAF, rate-limiting, bot management, Access Control and have that all behind one single pane of glass is a very, very, very compelling offering, or somewhat starkly. If you look at some of the other Zero Trust vendors that are out there, they're actually Cloudflare customers using our DDoS mitigation products because we're the best of the world - in the world of them.\nShrenik Kothari: Great. Just - very super helpful. Just a quick follow-up on what you said around Zero Trust. I mean I agree, your margin really allows you to kind of disrupt the market, kind of enabling you to use pricing as a competitive advantage. And of course, you discussed the DDoS pricing. And on Zero Trust, like where you're bundling around SASE and Zero Trust. Just curious, like, it still seems like you guys are still pricing kind of similarly uniquely versus the market more attractively? Just curious, are you thinking about kind of also going for like premium optimal pricing given where the market is, given the strength of the demand and also try to push forward on the margin front, is that a lever that you guys are thinking through?\nMatthew Prince: I think that we can use price there as a weapon to win business. We have tended not to see that there's a lot of price sensitivity there. So, we're not going to just push that if we don't have to. I think that the place that is more attractive is actually in how we create platforms where you can have a complete network security solution. And it's also really powerful that we can run our Zero Trust products at extremely, extremely high margins, where it's actually the same reasons as the DDoS mitigation products. If you take all of the other Zero Trust vendors that are out there and add up all their traffic, we could add them all to Cloudflare's network without significantly increasing our underlying COGS of delivering that traffic. And so, that gives us an advantage over time. And we do believe that whoever has the lowest cost of servicing tends to win over the long term. And that is something that is very difficult for any of our competitors in that space to match.\nShrenik Kothari: Got it. That's super helpful. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you so much. Matt, you guys continue to amaze me in the ability to anticipate things five, six, seven years before they happen, I think about the microthreading of - micro services in your serverless platform as an example. And now you're talking about having less slots open for inference AI, six years ahead of schedule. It's pretty amazing prescience. But I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the uniqueness of the platform as we move into the world driven by inference AI. It's pretty clear to me that the combination of the Workers platform, combined with the location of your edge, combined with all of the other elements of the service platform at the edge gives you a unique positioning, particularly with the R2 and the vectors stuff that you've announced. So is there anybody else that has, in our reasonable positioning to compete with you in that context? Or are you as unique as you look to me - in this competitive landscape?\nMatthew Prince: Thanks for the kudos. And I think we sometimes are a little bit early. And sometimes, and for people who are paying close attention almost three years ago, we actually did an announcement with NVIDIA that was a trial balloon, kind of in the space to see how much demand there was. And at the time, there wasn't a ton of demand, but we could see how models are improving. Inference is improving. We knew that this was something which was coming. And so we learned from that first thing. I think we've built a really strong relationship with the NVIDIA team in part because of that, and some of the work that we've done with them in the networking space. But I think that we try to learn and stay and buy ourselves the flexibility over time to be able to deliver in this space. I don't know of anybody else that has an architecture like ours, where we made the hard decision early on, to say, every machine everywhere can run every task. So that we don't have dedicated scrubbing centers. So that we don't have dedicated regions for 1 service or another. That has required us to invent a lot of technology. And build a lot of intellectual property around that technology and just a lot of know-how in running a network like that. It is harder upfront to build it that way. But it results in a much higher level of efficiency, a much higher level of - a much faster pace of innovation, and we're able to capitalize on that today. And so I think it would require a complete rearchitecture from any of the providers that we know in order to be able to do what we've done in this space. And I think it's, again, part of the secret to our continued pace of innovation. And again, really proud of our team and everything that they've done to be able to deliver it.\nAlex Henderson: One last question along the same line, if I could. The inference AI market, how much of it do you expect to be at the edge? And how much do you expect within inference that might be in more centralized or regionalized locations? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: So I mean my thesis around this is that, probably the most inference tasks will be run directly on your device. So on your Apple device, on your Samsung device, on your LG device, whatever that is. But ideally, you're going to want to have it so that you can seamlessly hand off, whether you're using a low-power device that needs to optimize for battery life or needs to optimize for the lowest build of materials, or you're trying to run a task, which is so big and powerful that you're going to have to hand that off to a device nearby. And so you want the rails between those things to be as seamless and efficient as possible. And from a user's experience, you're going to want that to be transparent to them. And so I think the most powerful devices out there are going to get more and more powerful with the models that are running on them, but less powerful devices, devices that, again, have to have weeks of battery life but still need to be smart or the most interesting models that are bigger and can do more interesting things, I think it's going to naturally make sense for that inference to be actually running as close as possible to the end user. I don't see a ton of reasons why you would run inference back in some centralized location. I think that, that is going to have a performance penalty in doing that. I think it's going to have a regulatory penalty in doing that. I think it's going to also have, actually, cost disadvantage in sending it back to a central location. And so as we build this out and we give people the tools to be able to run those sophisticated models at the edge, I think it's a two-horse race that is going to be the phone and device manufacturers that are going to get better and better and better over time. And then it's going to be connectivity clouds like Cloudflare that are going to deliver on those models that can't run on the end device itself.\nAlex Henderson: Superb. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. Matthew, you have so many products that can help companies reduce the egress fees and all the other charges that are running up in their hyperscaler bills. And I was thinking of Super Slurper and Sippy and HyperDrive, and some of the other products, could you comment on the demand patterns there? And just whether you're benefiting from some of those optimization efforts out there. And then I have a quick follow-up.\nMatthew Prince: Yes, I think that that's - I mean, everyone today is looking at their cloud bill and saying, how can we make this go down? How can we get more with every IT dollar that is being spent? And as companies do that, they are realizing that, one, the best way to not get just completely gauged by whoever your cloud provider is, is not be completely dependent on them, and have the ability to negotiate and move data and workloads from one provider to another. And so enabling that multi-cloud universe is just fundamental to how we think about what we're doing. And then second, to finding those places where you might be more locked in today and finding ways to release that lock in. And I think that's fundamentally what we're doing at Cloudflare. As I talked about in the beginning, the hyperscale public clouds, the key KPI that they pay attention to is, how much of a customer's data are they hoarding on their systems? Do they hold captive, where the cloud players, what we pay the most attention to is, how much connectivity can we deliver? How many things can we make it easy to move that data between? And I think that fundamental difference, it's not so much that we're trying to compete directly with the cloud, but over time, what we really want to do is enable customers to be able to get the best out of AWS and Google, and Microsoft, and Oracle, and IBM, and Alibaba, and Tencent and be that fabric that connects them all together. And I think more and more customers are seeing the power of that. They're multicloud, whether they want to be or not, and we're the consistent control plane that can sit between all of those things, help them reduce their costs, help them reduce lock-in, and really have a much more competitive cloud ecosystem over time.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much for that. I really appreciate it. And just as a follow-up, is there any rough math on the number of GPUs you're loading into suitcases to install over the next 12 months? And should we assume that those are, or that there can be some of the lower-end GPUs for inferencing and they're not the ultra-expensive high-end ones?\nMatthew Prince: I think that what we hear from customers is that they don't want to have to think about what GPU is the right GPU for them. And so we will have a mix of GPUs. Today, we're standardized around NVIDIA, but we're good friends with the folks at AMD and Intel and Qualcomm. We're all doing interesting things and different models from what we've seen performed differently on different types of GPUs that are out there. And so I think you'll find every flavor under the sun of - from expensive to cheap delivered across the network. But what we're really trying to optimize for, is looking at the models that are being run and then giving people the right tools that they need in a way that can give them the best performance on, not just a speed basis, but also on a cost and efficiency basis. And that's going to be diversity across that ecosystem. And we are good at being able to scale up our capacity as we have demand and investing behind the demand. And I think that this is going to be another area where we demonstrate that.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks all for squeezing me in here at the end. Matthew, I just wanted to piggyback, maybe of some of your last comments there on that final question, and just the ones you had in your prepared remarks around the category classification of the connectivity cloud. That makes total sense to me in terms of the strategic, more CIO lens, as far as kind of the benefits of being on that connective tissue and kind of savings around R2 and kind of all the things. But as you go and talk to CISOs and especially within the context of your R2 products that you have, Zero Trust and otherwise, does that messaging kind of need to change a little bit? Or do you think they view it in the same way? Because I think they're kind of, obviously, the audience is in the kind of the overall value front might, I mean, be similar, but given to some respects, just maybe help us understand how might that CISO respond or are, in fact, responding to that same connectivity cloud messaging. Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think we've been strong with CISOs for some time, and they know us and they know the value that we can deliver. I think what we're trying to make sure is that we have, can have a strategic conversation with the CIOs and the CFOs that are out there and say, here's how we can deliver value, help you consolidate vendors and give you one consistent control plane that is - that has an incredible ROI to it. So I think we're - we don't want to rest on our laurels. We've been very, very strong with practitioners. We've been very strong in the security community but we want to make sure that we can have that strategic conversation. And we had a record number of customers that we signed up, at over $1 million a year with us. We had a record number that crossed into the $5 million a year with us this last quarter. And those are conversations that have to be had the CFO, even in large companies, the CFO is going to be involved in signing $5 million deals. And so I think that the messaging is the right time and it reflects that we are talking to higher and higher levels within the organization, and we are being seen much more as a strategic partner within those companies.\nTrevor Walsh: That\u2019s great. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Matthew Prince for closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: I appreciate everyone at Cloudflare, all of our customers, partners in helping us navigate what is an increasingly complicated world. Our thoughts are with all of the people around the world that are being affected by war. We're continuing to deliver our services and stand up for the Internet, and even in these incredibly complicated times, the work that Cloudflare does is important in making sure the Internet can continue to thrive. Thank you all. I'll see you back in the next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. During the third quarter, as we continue to refine our go-to-market strategies and operations, our pipeline growth rates have held steady, our productivity remained consistent and linearity was similar to last quarter. We are pleased to see significant growth with general partners, momentum with large customers and strength in the public sector. Importantly, we continue to maintain our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible, and as good stewards of investors' capital. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of record operating profit, increasing nearly threefold year-over-year and significantly outperformed on free cash flow. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 32% year-over-year to $335.6 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 30% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 36% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 27% year-over-year. Turning to our customer metrics. In the third quarter, we had 182,027 paying customers, representing an increase of 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 2,558 large customers, representing an increase of 34% year-over-year, and an addition of 206 large customers in the quarter. In fact, we added a record number of net new customers year-over-year spending more than $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 116% during the third quarter, representing an increase of 100 basis points sequentially. Also, there can be some variability in this metric quarter-to-quarter, we continue to believe the recent decelerating trend in DNR, stabilizing near lease levels. Moving to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin was 78.7%, representing an increase of 100 basis points sequentially, and an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 8% of revenue in the third quarter as we continue to benefit from our focus on driving greater efficiency from our infrastructure and the uniqueness of our platform to onboard new workloads. Despite having begun to invest in the enormous AI opportunity in front of us, with the planned rollout of GPUs to more than 100 cities by the end of this year, we expect network CapEx to be 8% to 10% of revenue in fiscal 2023. However, we anticipate network CapEx to return to more normalized levels over time. Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 5% sequentially and decreased by 6% year-over-year to 66%. Our total number of employees increased 11% year-over-year, bringing our total head count to 3,529 at the end of the quarter. We were selective in hiring during the quarter, as we continue to evaluate deploying AI and automation at scale to reengineer our business processes across the company. Early investments in these areas are already delivering encouraging returns. We will remain prudent in hiring as we continue to invest in broadening and deepening the usage of AI and automation across our operations to drive higher productivity and greater efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses were $129 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3% sequentially and decreased 38% from 41% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $54.2 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1% sequentially and decreased to 16% from 18% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $38.5 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2% sequentially and decreased 11% from 13% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $42.5 million compared to $14.8 million in the same period last year. Third quarter operating margin was 12.7%, an increase of 690 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our ongoing focus on becoming more productive and doing more with less, given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $55.3 million or a diluted net income per share of $0.16. We ended the third quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $34.9 million in the third quarter or 10% of revenue, compared to negative $4.6 million or 2% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $1.1 billion, representing an increase of 5% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. With broadening geopolitical uncertainty and increasingly mixed macroeconomic data points across geographies, the business environment in which we operate remains challenging to predict. And as a result, we continue to remain prudent and cautious in our outlook for the fourth quarter. Now turning to guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $352 million to $353 million, representing an increase of 28% to 29% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $28 million to $29 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 7%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.12, assuming approximately 354 million shares outstanding. Please note that our share count guidance now includes dilution from our convertible senior notes of approximately 6.8 million shares, given that Cloudflare has achieved a level of profitability whereby these securities are no longer deemed and be diluted. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.286 billion to $1.287 billion, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $110 million to $111 million, and we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.45 to $0.46, assuming approximately 350 million shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 8% for 2023. After having achieved significant free cash flow in the first three quarters of the year, we expect to generate over $100 million in free cash flow for the full year 2023. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission, as well as our customers, for trusting us to help them solve some of the hardest problems that they face when modernizing and transforming their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Well, we won't talk too much about '24 on this earnings call, you might expect there will be time for that on our next earnings call. But I think it's important in mind, to keep in mind that we've been talking about how cascading the impacts are in terms of the progress we make and when it hits our books, right? It's all about building pipeline first, and we have seen strength there in the third quarter, continued in the fourth quarter. How this turns into ACV? This is where uncertainty is. And once it hits ACV, it will take a turn of four quarters before it shows up into revenue. So we have seen good targets, especially at the beginning of this cascade. And as we move through that waterfall of progress, you'll see results showing up in our numbers in next year. Yes. Just following up on what Matthew said. I think we have the business really well instrumented. And you could see this now managing ourselves through quite some macroeconomic turbulences. So the business is well instrumented. The business model is still in a way that it allows us to have visibility when demand picks up and we will invest behind the demand. We've also realized that there is significant scalability and efficiency in the business model. This is what you are - what has been showing up in the financial numbers over the last a couple of quarters really well. So I think the combination of visibility into - is that picking up or not, a well-instrumented business and a lot of elasticity in how we move forward, keeps us confident that we have their hands firm on the rudder, and can control the ramp up really well. Coming back to your second question. So today, the share of variable revenue - of our overall revenue is very, very low. But the ramp of the AI service and products that Matt has just mentioned, would increase this share. We've seen some of the strength actually in the third quarter from a revenue perspective already coming from variable revenue. So this is one data point. It's not enough to make a good correlation or a trend. But with a higher share of variable, with products and services that are price variable, you would see a more immediate impact on revenue for sure. But we don't have enough data yet to see how this will play out, but the first signs are encouraging. RPO for the third quarter was $1.83 billion. I think it was part of my script. Expansion is getting better, DNR ticked up 1 percentage point. So it's stabilizing. I think that is what we have been talking about in the previous earnings call that we see bottoming out. But I would still say that it is easier to have new logo acquisition than it is to expand with existing customers. And the trend we have seen that this might be impacted, timing-wise or budget-wise, by current macro concerns, I think still holds true. It has not changed materially from the third quarter - from the second quarter."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Phil. We had another strong quarter in spite of an increasingly uncertain world. In Q3, we achieved revenue of $335.6 million up 32% year-over-year. We added 206 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, and now have 2,558 large customers, up 34% year-over-year. Looking at even larger customers, we added a record number of net new customers year-over-year spending more than both $500,000 and $1 million per year with Cloudflare. Our dollar-based net retention ticked up 1% to 116%. We see this as a lagging indicator and expect that it will take some time for the go-to-market improvements we're seeing across our team to be fully reflected. During the quarter, we continued to refine these go-to-market strategies. Our pipeline close rates held steady, our sales force productivity remained constant and linearity was similar to Q2. I think that we have been able to hold things steady while making significant organizational changes and improvements across our sales and marketing organization is very encouraging. Beyond that, we're beginning to see positive early signs from the sales team members we've brought on over the six months to replace underperformers. During the quarter, the pipeline generated by this new cohort was 1.6x higher than those brought on at the same time a year earlier. These new account executives achieved more than 130% of their activity goals for the quarter. That's great news. And we're thrilled to have them on board. And while they're still ramping, I'm encouraged by the performance, and that we've been able to revamp as much of our sales team as we have without significant disruption. Our gross margin was 78.7%, still well above our target range of 75% to 77%, and up from 77.7% last quarter. We delivered an operating profit of $42.5 million, our fifth consecutive record quarter for the company. This represents an operating margin of 12.7%. Operating profit increased nearly 3x year-over-year, underscoring our commitment to operating efficiency and productivity. We continue to generate positive free cash flow. In Q3, we generated $34.9 million during the quarter, representing a free cash flow margin of 10.4%. This is a business that can generate significant cash, and in 2023, we expect we will generate more than $100 million in free cash flow, well ahead of our original goal when we started the year, and the direct result of improved execution across our entire business. In Q3, we celebrated our 13th anniversary of Cloudflare's launch, a time we call Birthday Week. We officially entered our teenage years and like many kids, it took us a while to fully understand and articulate the category we belong to. The day before our 13th birthday, we announced to the world, that we realized what we are, a connectivity cloud. Connectivity means we measure ourselves by connecting people and things together. Cloud means the batteries are included. It scales with you. It's programmable, has consistent security built in, it's intelligent and learns from your usage and others to optimize for outcomes better than you could on your own. Our connectivity cloud is worth contrasting against some of the other first-generation clouds. The hyperscale public clouds are, in many ways, the opposite. They optimize for hoarding your data, locking it in, making it difficult to move. They are captivity cloud. While they may be great for some things, their full potential is only truly unlocked for customers when combined with the connectivity cloud that lets you mix and match the best of each of their features. That's what we hear from customers, that they are multicloud, whether they want to be or not. And that's what they really need, is a connectivity cloud, to hook all their systems together in a fast, secure, reliable way. The messaging of the connectivity cloud is resonating with customers and helping them understand the full extent of what Cloudflare is able to deliver for them. We are not any one of our individual features or even as some of them. We are a cloud that helps you get the most out of connectivity, and customers love that and are leaning into it. Speaking of customers, we've had some great customer wins in the quarter I'd like to highlight. A U.S. government cabinet level agency within the executive branch, signed a one-year $2 million contract. Cloudflare's replacing three point solution vendors, including a 20-year old incumbent solution. We're providing a unified application security for 600 U.S. government applications. They were drawn to Cloudflare's modern architecture, rate of innovation, robust network and ability to reduce complexity by consolidating multiple point solutions into a single pane of glass. Another U.S. government agency signed a one year $510,000 contract for Cloudflare's Zero Trust solutions, including Access, Gateway, Browser Isolation and Data Loss Prevention. We were selected over first-generation Zero Trust competitors due to our ability to consolidate numerous products across both application security and Zero Trust onto a single platform. Our federal business has grown significantly over the last year, and we believe these deals are just at the tip of the iceberg with both of these customers, which we expect can expand significantly. A leading health care company signed a three year $1 million contract for Cloudflare's Zero Trust solutions, including Access, Gateway, Browser Isolation and Area 1 Email Security. They are a legacy vendor looking to modernize their security posture as they migrate on-prem applications to the cloud. They experienced a sophisticated e-mail phishing attack mid-process, and with Area 1, we were able to immediately protect them. They chose us over first-generation Zero Trust solutions because of the comprehensiveness of our solution, including e-mail security. The VP of Technology said succinctly, we should have partnered with Cloudflare earlier. A major European consulting company signed a three year $1.6 million contract for Access and Gateway, along with Magic WAN and our data localization suite. They selected Cloudflare over first-generation Zero Trust competitors because of the breadth of our platform. The theme across these examples is customers are looking for a Zero Trust solution, increasingly wanting to protect their entire network. Cloudflare is the only vendor that can deliver a comprehensive network-wide solution from a single vendor. Switching gears a bit, a Fortune 500 semiconductor company expanded their relationship to Cloudflare, signing a three year $1.4 million contract. The customer was looking to modernize their network security posture. They adopted our Magic Transit product. They were able to consolidate multiple point solutions on to Cloudflare's unified platform. An African public utility company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a four year $3 million contract. This company first approached Cloudflare last year, facing multiple under attack situations. We onboarded the customer with Application Security and Magic Transit, stopping the attacks they were seeing. The customer was so impressed with Cloudflare's products and performance that they quadrupled their utilization and added additional products, including Magic Firewall. The fact that Cloudflare's network spans the globe gives us the ability to service clients everywhere. Another international technology company signed a two year $1.8 million contract for Magic Transit and Advanced Application Security. This customer approached us in the midst of a large-scale DDoS attack. Their incumbent solutions were provided by a mix of point solutions and bundled hyperscale cloud mitigation services, neither was sufficient to stay ahead of the attack. In Q3, we saw a significant increase in massive DDoS attacks. To give you a sense, these new attacks are generating nearly as much traffic as the entire Internet generates globally, but pointing it to a single victim. There are very few networks that can stand up to these attacks. I'm proud of the fact that Cloudflare is architected uniquely for this moment. And as the world becomes more complicated, and these attacks become more common, I think more and more of the Internet will turn to us for protection. A leading ad tech company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year $720,000 contract. This customer came to us with a technical workers use case. They needed a platform that could help them deliver through traffic spikes, up to 3 million requests per second. Their existing solutions on traditional hyperscale public clouds were expensive to maintain and would encounter errors with even relatively low traffic spikes. Cloudflare Workers was able to support their needs without bringing a sweat. With this win, we expect they will move more of their applications to our much easier to scale platform. A Fortune 500 technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year $2.9 million contract. This customer approached us to use our connectivity cloud to help them collect AI and machine learning data from their customers, while maintaining the highest level of privacy. They view Cloudflare as a leader in privacy, and we work closely with them to develop the solution. This deal makes clear the importance of privacy and the likely regulatory scrutiny of AI tasks and highlights how Cloudflare's network, which extends into the vast majority of countries on earth, can help customers take advantage of AI while complying with an increasingly complex regulatory environment. We continue to accelerate our efforts in AI. We believe Cloudflare is the most common cloud provider used by the leading AI companies. During our birthday celebrations in Q3, we made several announcements with companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta, Hugging Face and Databricks. We also announced Workers AI to put powerful AI inference within milliseconds of every Internet user. We believe inference is the biggest opportunity in AI and inference tasks will largely be run on end devices and connectivity clouds like Cloudflare. Right now, there are members of the Cloudflare team traveling the world with suitcases full of GPUs, installing them throughout our network. We have inference-optimized GPUs running in 75 cities worldwide as of the end of October, we are well on our way of hitting a goal of 100 by the end of 2023. By the end of 2024, we expect to have inference-optimized GPUs running in nearly every location where Cloudflare operates worldwide, making us easily the most widely distributed cloud-AI inference platform. We've been planning for this for the last six years, expecting that at some point, we hit the crossover, where deploying inference-optimized GPUs made sense. To that end, starting six years ago, we intentionally left one or more PCI slots in every server we built, empty. When the demand and the technology made sense, we started deploying. That means we can use our existing server infrastructure and just add GPU cards, allowing us to add this capability while still staying within our forecast CapEx envelope. And customers are excited. In the five weeks since our AI announcement, thousands of developers have leveraged our new AI capabilities to build full stack AI applications on Cloudflare's network, processing more than 18 million request through the new features we launched just over a month ago. The demand has exceeded our expectations and continued to accelerate, increasing 5x since mid-October. We have a pipeline of customers interested in putting hundreds of billions of inference tasks on our infrastructure each month. It's early days but the interest we're seeing from customers, large and small, over what they can build with powerful inference capabilities now embedded in one of the world's largest networks is inspiring. They like how easy it is to use Workers AI. They like how it's powerful, but close to their users around the world. They like the more efficient and fair pricing model, our serverless implementation delevers. And they like the flexibility of bringing their own models or fine-tuning existing models using the tools that are included as part of Workers AI. If we're right, that inference is the big AI opportunity, and that inference tasks that are too big and too complex to run on end devices, will need to run as close to the user as possible, then we've got a head start on building the preferred location for inference for the most interesting AI applications of the future. Finally, before I turn it over to Thomas, I wanted to acknowledge that we continue to live in very challenging times. The war in Ukraine continues unabated. Now we have a new war in the Middle East after the attack by Hamas on Israel. We have colleagues in the region who have been impacted directly and indirectly. Our thoughts are with them. And while we see the devastating images of the kinetic war, the online war is also raging. Cloudflare is committed to providing our services to humanitarian and civil society organizations at no cost, to ensure they can continue doing their important work for all those impacted by the increasingly hostile world we find ourselves in. In our business, we need to stay on top of cybersecurity issues globally and modern warfare continues to include the cyber battlefield. As I look back on the quarter, I'd like to thank our entire team at Cloudflare for all your hard work, innovation, dedication to supporting our customers and the greater Internet. Thank you for continuing to help build a better Internet for us all. And with that, I'll hand it off to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think that there are a couple of different areas where we're monetizing, and that's starting to show up in the results. And then there are a couple of areas where I think there's a longer time horizon and we're really optimizing for adoption. I think the place where we've been positively surprised is with our R2 product. R2 is our object store, and critically, it allows customers to be multi-cloud and to easily move data to wherever - they're - the resources that they need without charging them an egress tax like some of the other traditional hyperscale public clouds do. That's a place where a lot of the growth that we're seeing is coming from AI companies. They love the fact that they can take their data and their training sets and move it to wherever they are GPUs that are available around the world. And that's driving, and I think as we see more and more usage of that, that's driving revenue for us that we're realizing today. And I think that will be something that will go forward into the quarters to come. I think that some of the areas around inference, it's early days, but I think that you - I think you'd be likely to hear us start talking about larger customers that are moving significant workloads over to the AI space. I think that the individual developers will be - we're really going to optimize in that space for adoption, and building out an ecosystem. But as you hear us on earnings calls to come, talk about how people have really moved workloads, and we've got customers in the pipeline that are talking about moving billions of inference events per month to our network. That's when that starts to turn into real revenue for us. And I think it's early days, so we don't know exactly what the time frame on that will be, but the conversations we're having are very exciting, and it's a space that I'm definitely bullish on. Yes. So we've talked about how on previous calls, we really looked across our go-to-market functions and recognize that there was an opportunity for us to improve. And what I'm proud of is that we haven't waffled on that path. We haven't changed course. We haven't had significant disruption or distraction as we've gone through that. And I think that the caliber and quality of the people that we're bringing on to those go-to-market teams, the early indications are, and again, they're still ramping, but the early indications are that they're doing a significantly stronger job and they're delivering real results. So that's a process, and it takes time to work through that. But I think that we're seeing positive indication. I think we're being, we don't want to lose our marbles and be too aggressive, but we're being very disciplined. And one of the things I remember, what we've always talked about is how we've had a business where we invest behind the demand that we see. And I think the same thing is true on the go-to-market side, where we're seeing that the increased rigor and increased discipline has early signs of paying off. And if that continues and we get more data points along the way, then that's a place where we'll be able to invest with, again, new leadership in place and new training and enablement for our sales team. And again, I think we have - it's early still, but I think that we have good indication, and I'm proud of the fact that we did this so far without significant disruption or distraction within our business. Yes, Andy, thanks for the question. Again, it's an area that we're extremely excited about. I'm proud of the fact that our team has been able to get it rolled out as quickly as they have, our - we thought it was an ambitious goal to be in 100 cities by the end of the year. The fact that we're in, now over 75 today, and that we've been able to deliver that while staying very disciplined around CapEx is important. We're not seeing that people are waiting for things to be everywhere, for them to be in and testing. I do think that as we are going into various geographies around the world, it creates a real differentiation with us. We're hearing especially in markets outside of the United States, how they have felt left behind in the AI space. And increasingly, I think as you're seeing with the executive order on AI, with some of the European regulation on AI, being able to keep AI local is, we think, going to be something that's a real differentiation for us. The vector database, I think that's actually a good question to ask about and sort of got lost in some of the other stories, but I think some of the more sort of people who are paying attention within the AI space, recognize how important that is, being able to fine-tune your models and have a database that's built on top of the existing R2 infrastructure that we have, is something that not only allows us to do inference, but actually allows us to do fine-tuning as well, which gives us sort of two of the three major legs of the AI stool. And that's sort of my sneaky feature that I think is going to be pretty disruptive because you can use our vector database, whether you're using the rest of Cloudflare's AI systems, becomes a really great function for AI users, who are wanting to do fine tuning. And that, combined with the locality that we can deliver with the Workers AI system and inference scattered around, the entire world allows us to do something that is truly a complete AI ecosystem. And again, the AI developers that are paying attention, asked the same question, which is, Wow, how did you guys added vector database? And the good news is, again, all of these things are built on a lot of the primitives that we had before. We did have to go out and build something new. We can put GPUs in our existing servers. We could build sectorize the vector database on top of R2 and some of the other primitives that we had out there. And we could learn from the huge number of AI startups that are already using Cloudflare, in terms of what tools they needed in their tool kit, and that's what our team is delivering. Yes, I'll start and then Thomas can add to it. I think there are three different areas in which we can see growth and delivery from AI. The one where, we've seen it now, for at least the last 18 months, is just in our traditional products, using Cloudflare's security services to protect AI systems is absolutely critical. And as you go to some of the leading AI platforms that are out there, you'll often see Cloudflare's logo where we're using AI systems ourselves actually, to check to make sure you're a human being. Check to make sure that you're not a threat before letting you on. So that's - that, I think, is just our bread and butter, and what we can deliver very efficiently. The second area is with things like R2 and charging for storage. And again, that's going to be storing the models, storing the training sets for those models, using the fine-tuning data with R2 and vectorized to be able to process those models. And again, that's going to be much more like a - as you said, a consumption-based approach. And then the third way is that we're charging for inference. And what I think is unique about us, is because at core Cloudflare's incredibly good as a routing and scheduling engine, that's how we're able to deliver the very high gross margins that we have compared with some others in the space, is that we just get a much higher degree of utilization, and we pass that on to our customers. And in this case, the way that we're charging for our GPUs is termed by the industry as a serverless method of charging. And what that means is we only charge you for when you're actually running an inference task. And then we're able to schedule that very effectively across our entire platform. And we think that, that's going to be very -- as disruptive in this space as some of the things that we've done with Workers have been -- in the traditional space. And that's something that is very attractive to AI developers. So I think those are the three ways that we see as monetization around this. One is, our -- just traditional security products. Second is around storage of either training sets or models themselves, or the refining and fine-tuning model systems? Or then the third is, actually charging for what is effectively to compute capacity and doing that in a way that is, again, very disruptive, compared with some of the other providers that are in the space. And we can often decrease people's inference task costs pretty substantially, while that's still being a very high-margin business for us. So we're excited. Yes, Jim, so I'll take the first bit and then hand it off to Thomas for the second bit. I think we're seeing real strength around the network security and our Zero Trust products. We've been recognized as leaders in those spaces by a number of the key analysts. That's driven up the amount of interest. The pipeline for those products is extremely strong. And what we're seeing is that, increasingly, customers want -- especially in the sort of making every IT dollar go further, increasingly, they want to say, I don't just want to protect the back door of my business. I want to protect the front door, the back door, the side door and all of the doors in the business. And so we're the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass. And I think that, that comes through in a lot of customer examples and stories that we've seen. And so what we're seeing more and more is, people want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that's driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products. Yes. So first of all, I mean, the world is getting a lot more complicated, and we're seeing even nation state actors turning to DDoS attacks to disrupt services around the world, and a new attack vector, which our team alongside Google and AWS helped discover and announced this last quarter, is generating attacks that are, I mean, literally almost doubling the total volume of traffic on the entire Internet when they're going forward. And the nature of how we're able to stop those attacks and the architecture of how we're able to stop those attacks is very unique to Cloudflare. And we're seeing even some of the large hyperscale public clouds that have their own limited DDoS mitigation services point customers to us, because we're the best in the world at this. And I think that, that's a real differentiator for us. The pricing also is important. And what's unique is because every single server that is part of Cloudflare's network can run every single service. As we stop these massive attacks, not only are we, again, better able to technically stop them, but we are then able to do it without changing our underlying pricing because it doesn't drive up what our costs are. Early on, we said that we should pass that advantage on to our customers. And so we created pricing that was, as you said, very customer-centric that's appreciated by the market. I think more and more people are leaning in on DDoS and using us for that. And what we're seeing is that, then we can use that as sort of the milk in the grocery store where we can sell other products across our suite. And just like I said before, customers don't just want to protect the front door. They don't just want to protect the back door. They want to protect all of the parts of our business. And so we're seeing that having collective solutions from a platform that can solve DDoS, Zero Trust, WAF, rate-limiting, bot management, Access Control and have that all behind one single pane of glass is a very, very, very compelling offering, or somewhat starkly. If you look at some of the other Zero Trust vendors that are out there, they're actually Cloudflare customers using our DDoS mitigation products because we're the best of the world - in the world of them. I think that we can use price there as a weapon to win business. We have tended not to see that there's a lot of price sensitivity there. So, we're not going to just push that if we don't have to. I think that the place that is more attractive is actually in how we create platforms where you can have a complete network security solution. And it's also really powerful that we can run our Zero Trust products at extremely, extremely high margins, where it's actually the same reasons as the DDoS mitigation products. If you take all of the other Zero Trust vendors that are out there and add up all their traffic, we could add them all to Cloudflare's network without significantly increasing our underlying COGS of delivering that traffic. And so, that gives us an advantage over time. And we do believe that whoever has the lowest cost of servicing tends to win over the long term. And that is something that is very difficult for any of our competitors in that space to match. Thanks for the kudos. And I think we sometimes are a little bit early. And sometimes, and for people who are paying close attention almost three years ago, we actually did an announcement with NVIDIA that was a trial balloon, kind of in the space to see how much demand there was. And at the time, there wasn't a ton of demand, but we could see how models are improving. Inference is improving. We knew that this was something which was coming. And so we learned from that first thing. I think we've built a really strong relationship with the NVIDIA team in part because of that, and some of the work that we've done with them in the networking space. But I think that we try to learn and stay and buy ourselves the flexibility over time to be able to deliver in this space. I don't know of anybody else that has an architecture like ours, where we made the hard decision early on, to say, every machine everywhere can run every task. So that we don't have dedicated scrubbing centers. So that we don't have dedicated regions for 1 service or another. That has required us to invent a lot of technology. And build a lot of intellectual property around that technology and just a lot of know-how in running a network like that. It is harder upfront to build it that way. But it results in a much higher level of efficiency, a much higher level of - a much faster pace of innovation, and we're able to capitalize on that today. And so I think it would require a complete rearchitecture from any of the providers that we know in order to be able to do what we've done in this space. And I think it's, again, part of the secret to our continued pace of innovation. And again, really proud of our team and everything that they've done to be able to deliver it. So I mean my thesis around this is that, probably the most inference tasks will be run directly on your device. So on your Apple device, on your Samsung device, on your LG device, whatever that is. But ideally, you're going to want to have it so that you can seamlessly hand off, whether you're using a low-power device that needs to optimize for battery life or needs to optimize for the lowest build of materials, or you're trying to run a task, which is so big and powerful that you're going to have to hand that off to a device nearby. And so you want the rails between those things to be as seamless and efficient as possible. And from a user's experience, you're going to want that to be transparent to them. And so I think the most powerful devices out there are going to get more and more powerful with the models that are running on them, but less powerful devices, devices that, again, have to have weeks of battery life but still need to be smart or the most interesting models that are bigger and can do more interesting things, I think it's going to naturally make sense for that inference to be actually running as close as possible to the end user. I don't see a ton of reasons why you would run inference back in some centralized location. I think that, that is going to have a performance penalty in doing that. I think it's going to have a regulatory penalty in doing that. I think it's going to also have, actually, cost disadvantage in sending it back to a central location. And so as we build this out and we give people the tools to be able to run those sophisticated models at the edge, I think it's a two-horse race that is going to be the phone and device manufacturers that are going to get better and better and better over time. And then it's going to be connectivity clouds like Cloudflare that are going to deliver on those models that can't run on the end device itself. Yes, I think that that's - I mean, everyone today is looking at their cloud bill and saying, how can we make this go down? How can we get more with every IT dollar that is being spent? And as companies do that, they are realizing that, one, the best way to not get just completely gauged by whoever your cloud provider is, is not be completely dependent on them, and have the ability to negotiate and move data and workloads from one provider to another. And so enabling that multi-cloud universe is just fundamental to how we think about what we're doing. And then second, to finding those places where you might be more locked in today and finding ways to release that lock in. And I think that's fundamentally what we're doing at Cloudflare. As I talked about in the beginning, the hyperscale public clouds, the key KPI that they pay attention to is, how much of a customer's data are they hoarding on their systems? Do they hold captive, where the cloud players, what we pay the most attention to is, how much connectivity can we deliver? How many things can we make it easy to move that data between? And I think that fundamental difference, it's not so much that we're trying to compete directly with the cloud, but over time, what we really want to do is enable customers to be able to get the best out of AWS and Google, and Microsoft, and Oracle, and IBM, and Alibaba, and Tencent and be that fabric that connects them all together. And I think more and more customers are seeing the power of that. They're multicloud, whether they want to be or not, and we're the consistent control plane that can sit between all of those things, help them reduce their costs, help them reduce lock-in, and really have a much more competitive cloud ecosystem over time. I think that what we hear from customers is that they don't want to have to think about what GPU is the right GPU for them. And so we will have a mix of GPUs. Today, we're standardized around NVIDIA, but we're good friends with the folks at AMD and Intel and Qualcomm. We're all doing interesting things and different models from what we've seen performed differently on different types of GPUs that are out there. And so I think you'll find every flavor under the sun of - from expensive to cheap delivered across the network. But what we're really trying to optimize for, is looking at the models that are being run and then giving people the right tools that they need in a way that can give them the best performance on, not just a speed basis, but also on a cost and efficiency basis. And that's going to be diversity across that ecosystem. And we are good at being able to scale up our capacity as we have demand and investing behind the demand. And I think that this is going to be another area where we demonstrate that. Yes. I think we've been strong with CISOs for some time, and they know us and they know the value that we can deliver. I think what we're trying to make sure is that we have, can have a strategic conversation with the CIOs and the CFOs that are out there and say, here's how we can deliver value, help you consolidate vendors and give you one consistent control plane that is - that has an incredible ROI to it. So I think we're - we don't want to rest on our laurels. We've been very, very strong with practitioners. We've been very strong in the security community but we want to make sure that we can have that strategic conversation. And we had a record number of customers that we signed up, at over $1 million a year with us. We had a record number that crossed into the $5 million a year with us this last quarter. And those are conversations that have to be had the CFO, even in large companies, the CFO is going to be involved in signing $5 million deals. And so I think that the messaging is the right time and it reflects that we are talking to higher and higher levels within the organization, and we are being seen much more as a strategic partner within those companies. I appreciate everyone at Cloudflare, all of our customers, partners in helping us navigate what is an increasingly complicated world. Our thoughts are with all of the people around the world that are being affected by war. We're continuing to deliver our services and stand up for the Internet, and even in these incredibly complicated times, the work that Cloudflare does is important in making sure the Internet can continue to thrive. Thank you all. I'll see you back in the next quarter."

By now, everyone should have access to our earnings announcement. This announcement, as well as our supplemental financial information, may be found on our investor relations website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements during today's discussion, including, but not limited to, our customers, vendors, and partners, operations, and future financial performance, our anticipated product launches and timing and market potential of those products, our anticipated future financial and operating performance and our expectations regarding future macroeconomic conditions. These statements and other comments are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, much of which is beyond our control. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any of our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact our future operating results and financial condition, please see our filings with the SEC as well as in today's earnings press release. Unless otherwise noted, all numbers we talk about today, other than revenue, will be on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. You may find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that are included in our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. For historical periods, a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in a supplemental financial information referenced a few moments ago. We would also like to inform you that we will be participating in Stifel's Tech Executive Summit on August 29th, and the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on September 6th. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince : Thank you, Phil. We had a strong quarter in spite of continued macroeconomic uncertainty. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $308.5 million, up 32% year-over-year. We added 196 new large customers, those that pay us more than a $100,000 per year and now have 2,352 large customers, up 34% year-over-year. Our focus on go-to-market improvements is already paying off. After we saw sales cycles increase 20% in Q1, disciplined around deals had them return to levels closer to what we saw last year. While our customers and prospects continue to be very careful around their IT spend, our improved execution led to a record quarter in new ACV bookings. My sense, talking to customers is that while the macro environment is still challenging, it is stabilized. And for the first time in several quarters, sentiment among IT buyers does not appear to be getting worse. Our dollar-based net retention ticked down to a 115%, down 2% quarter-over-quarter. Dollar-based net retention is a lagging indicator. So it will be slower to reflect the go-to-market improvements we are seeing. It's also important to note that we did not see any new competitive pressure or churn throughout the quarter. Instead, the lower dollar-based net retention is due to slower expansion from some of our existing customers. We expect that our focus on go-to-market operational excellence will improve this metric over time. Our gross margin held stable at 77.7%, still above our long-term target of 75% to 77% and in line with 77.8% last quarter. We delivered an operating profit of $20.3 million, our fourth consecutive quarter with a record operating profit. We also meaningfully outperformed on free cash flow, generating $20 million during the quarter, which represents a free cash flow margin of 6.5%. I'm proud that our team has proven we can not only execute in good times, but also be disciplined and deliver operational improvements while we're in more challenging times. We continue to see very strong pipeline growth. Q2 was another record for new pipeline generation. As we discussed last quarter, we made significant changes in our sales team to proactively address underperformance. That went very well, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our top performers are invigorated. We saw a marked improvement in the average account executive productivity. At the same time, we've implemented robust onboarding, enablement, and training programs. Combined with the record number of applicants we're seeing for sales roles, this makes for the right formula to build a worldclass sales organization. And our team is armed with great products to sell. Last quarter alone, Forrester recognized Area 1, our email security product, as a leader. IDC recognized us as the leader for two reports, in Zero Trust and network edge security-as-a-service, and we were the only new vendor recognized by Gartner for Secure Service Edge. Our developer platform, Cloudflare Workers, continues its explosive growth. We reached 10 million active Workers applications in Q2, up 250% since December and 490% year-over-year. R2 continues to grow and now stores over 13 petabytes of customer data, up 85% quarter-over-quarter. We have 44,000 distinct paying customers with R2 subscription, and brand name customers are beginning to adopt it as their primary object storage solution. That seems like a good segue to name some other customer wins in the quarter. One of the fastest growing generative AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $1.7 million contract, less than a year after first starting to use our platform. Like many AI companies in the space, this customer relies on a multi-cloud architecture for training and processing requests. R2 lets them unlock the best prices and performance across multiple cloud providers. In their words, \u201cWe see Cloudflare as a strategic foundational glue across all our services. Cloudflare continues to be our best strategic partner of all partners.\u201d That's great to hear from many customers, but it's especially fun coming from a company that's doing such cutting-edge work. These days feel like membership in the CEO club is predicated on saying AI as many times as possible in your earnings call script. I have to confess, I still find it a bit awkward. When we first pitched Cloudflare to venture capitalists back in 2010, at one point, I described us as, \u201cThe first AI powered security company for the cloud.\u201d The eye rolls around the table were so intense that I'm still a bit scared. But more than a decade later, here we are. And by our estimates, Cloudflare is the most commonly used cloud provider across the leading AI startups. They're using R2 to help arbitrage the lowest GPU cost to train their models. They're using our security tools themselves powered by AI or what our team would prefer to call machine learning to protect their own AI systems. And increasingly, they're using the edge of our network to perform inference. We are continuing to invest in this area and believe that we are uniquely positioned to win the inference market, which we believe will be substantially larger than the AI training market. In Q2, we hosted our Developer Week, highlighting 10 major announcements and features to extend Cloudflare Workers as the preeminent developer platform for the leading AI company. Q3 will feature our annual birthday week, and we have a lot more in store to provide picks and shovels to enable AI companies to build the future. Beyond AI, Cloudflare\u2019s Zero Trust Solutions were another big winner in Q2. A Fortune 500 technology services company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $7.2 million contract for 25,000 Zero Trustees. That brought their annual spend with us to over $5 million. They first became a customer in Q3 last year using our application security products. Six months into the deployment, one of their senior executives said, \u201cCloudflare is like magic and brought us into an ongoing competitive Zero Trust proof of concept.\u201d Cloudflare's existing gateway products were chosen over first generation Zero Trust competitors due to our rate of innovation and ability to consolidate all their security onto a single pane of glass. One of the largest online recruiting platforms expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a 25-month $2.4 million contract and bringing their annual spend over $5 million. With more than 90% of their employees remote, they were looking for a comprehensive Zero Trust solution and evaluated us against every leading vendor in the market. They decided to go all in on Cloudflare with 15,000 seats for access, gateway, CASB, data loss prevention, browser isolation, and Area 1 email security. I'm especially proud of how quickly we were able to onboard them, less than a month to fully replace their first generation Zero Trust vendor. That's awesome. An Australian technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year $2.2 million contract, bringing their total spend with us to over $5 million. This customer started out on our pay as you go plan in 2016 This quarter, they signed a Zero Trust deal to protect their expanding workforce. They're also broadening their use of Cloudflare\u2019s developer platform with both R2 and Durable Objects. Sticking down under, a leading Australian healthcare provider expanded their relationship with us, signing a three-year $2.8 million contract. We are replacing their hodgepodge of first generation Zero Trust vendors with 12,000 seats of access, gateway, browser isolation, CASB, data loss protection, and Area 1 email security. This is another example of a customer looking to consolidate vendors and choosing Cloudflare for their holistic network security solution. Here's another cool one. A Fortune 500 social network expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $2.4 million contract. They initially became a customer a year ago, building on top of Workers and using our global network to authenticate the security of one of their messaging products. They approached us again looking to add increased privacy onto another product with our Privacy Gateway solution. They view Cloudflare as a leader in privacy based on our co-development of the Oblivious HTTP standard, and they admire us as one of the only other companies that truly understand scale. As privacy is increasingly top of mind, we believe there will be more and more of these sort of strategically beneficial relationships. I think I've only said AI 11 times so far, putting me way behind Satya. So let me end with one more AI customer win. Another generative AI company expanded their relationship with us, signing a three-year $1.3 million contract. They came to us for our developer platform, signing up as a pay-as-you-go customer. Because their developers loved us, they approached us about a security need and signed a deal to use our application security and Zero Trust products. They're only 100 seats, but they're growing like crazy and building Cloudflare deep into their whole stack. Whether you're a Fortune 500 industrial company that used us for application security and are now hiring AI developers to use our Workers' platform to drive innovation across your business or you're a 100 person AI startup that started using our developer platform and then realized you can get the same security as the biggest Fortune 500 companies, that's what's really unique about Cloudflare. We've built the cloud that connects the world securely, reliably, and efficiently. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew. And thank you to everyone for joining us. During the second quarter, I'm pleased to share that we've seen improvements in terms of the impact from the external challenges that we highlighted last quarter. Specifically, also still somewhat elevated from historical levels, sales cycles shortened in part due to the implementation of more efficient processes and tactics. Our pipeline close rates have also shown improvement as we continue to refine our go-to-market strategies and operations. Furthermore, we observed a notable uptick in collections on our accounts receivable, which we believe reflects a rebound in customer confidence and financial stability. We also continue to maintain our strong commitment to being fully responsible and act as good stewards of investors' capital. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of record operating profit. We also prudently allocated capital with a focus on maximizing shareholder value by taking action to retire our 2025 convertible notes during the second quarter. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 32% year-over-year to $308.5 million. From a geographic perspective, the US represented 53% of revenue, and increased 30% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 38% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 23% year-over-year. We were pleased to see notable performance in the EMEA and APAC regions with both achieving record new ACV bookings in the second quarter. The strength in APAC was primarily driven by large customer deals, and we are seeing security become an even higher priority in EMEA given the geopolitical situation in the region. Turning to our customer metrics. In the second quarter, we had 174,129 paying customers, representing an increase of 15% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 2,352 large customers, representing an increase of 34% year-over-year and an addition of 196 large customers in the quarter. In fact, we added a record number of customers spending more than $500,000 on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. And the second quarter was also one of our highest quarterly additions of customers, spending more than $1 million annually, including our largest Zero Trust contract to date. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 115% during the second quarter, representing a decrease of 200 basis points sequentially. Importantly, renewal rates in the second quarter were consistent with the quarterly average in 2022, which was an all-time high for the company. Instead, similar to the last two quarters, the decline in DNR was again primarily driven by slower expansion in our larger customer cohort. We calculate DNR by comparing the analyzed revenue from paying customers four quarters prior to the annualized revenue from the same set of customers in the most recent quarter. As a result, this will be a lagging indicator of Cloudflare\u2019s underlying business trends. Based on our visibility, we believe the deceleration in DNR is nearing a bottom. Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 77.7%, representing a decrease of 10 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 120 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 11% of revenue in the second quarter. For fiscal 2023, we now expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue, underscoring the scalability and efficiency of our network even as we onboard new workloads, including AI. Turning to the operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased by 8% year-over-year to 71%. Our total number of employees increased 11% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to 3,389 at the end of the quarter. During the second quarter, we addressed consistently low performing sales capacity with a focus on upgrading our customer facing talents to improve growth, increase productivity and drive long-term success. We will continue to pace hiring for the year based on market conditions and remain committed to raising the bar on new high additions given talent opportunities available in the market. Sales and marketing expenses were $125.4 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percent of revenue decreased by 1% sequentially and decreased to 41% from 44% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $53 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1% sequentially and decreased to 17% from 20% in the same quarter last year. G&A expenses were $41 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 13% from 15% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $20.3 million compared to an operating loss of $891,000 in the same period last year. Second quarter operating margin was 6.6%, an increase of 700 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive, not just during the currently uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, but also because operational efficiency is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $33.7 million or a diluted net income per share of $0.10. We ended the second quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $20 million in the second quarter or 6% of revenue compared to negative $4.4 million or 2% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations or RPO came in at $1 billion, representing an increase of 8% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. Before moving to guidance for the third quarter and full year, I would like to begin with our expectations and the provisions we have factored into this outlook. Despite being encouraged by the forward progress we delivered during the second quarter in terms of shortening sales cycles and improving close rates, mixed macroeconomic data points serve as a reminder that we are operating in a business environment that thought showing signs of stabilization, continue to be challenging to predict. As a result, we remain prudent and cautious in our outlook for the second half of the year and we are fully committed to continuing to adapt our tactics and strategies in response to these external variables. Now turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $330 million to $331 million, representing an increase of 30% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $20 million to $21 million and we expect diluted net income per share of $0.10, assuming approximately 347 million shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 11%. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.283 billion to $1.287 billion, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $81 million to $85 million. And we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.37, assuming approximately 345 million shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 9% for 2023. After having achieved positive free cash flow in the second half of last year and again, during both the first and second quarters of this year, we anticipate generating significant free cash flow for the full year 2023. For modeling purposes, we continue to expect free cash flow to trend upward on an ongoing basis, but anticipate variability in our free cash flow generation quarter to quarter. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers, and partners. And to our shareholders, we greatly value your continued support. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the results and the outlook. Matthew, can you talk about some of your displacement activity this quarter? And maybe my second part of the question will be, do you see AI is accelerating your displacements and win rates? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Yeah, Shaul. I really appreciate the question. We've had a lot of noise on the line from the operator. So hopefully, we can get things muted. Apologies for that. So I think that when we look at displacement, it really is across three different parts of our business. So the first area is our conditional application security business. And in that space, we continue to place -- displace a number of traditional hardware vendors, the people who are providing web application firewalls, load balancers, funding various services that people had in those in those areas. We also see point cloud solutions that are doing just one of those things, getting displaced by us where we can very much pick up a significant amount of their business. And that -- that's been the case for quite some time. In our -- the second part of our business, which is our Zero Trust business, the first is sort of the front door of your business, the second is kind of the back door of your business. The Zero Trust business is about protecting employees and data. In that case, we're more and more going head-to-head with the other first generation Zero Trust providers. So the Zscalers, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco Umbrellas of the world. And, again, we really like our win rates in this space. And in a number of the examples that I cited, we were specifically, either in competitive solutions there, or in some cases where we were actually doing takeouts, people who have made bets on the first generation of Zero Trust providers and wanted to upgrade to us for, better ROI, a much better user experience, much faster, more performant network. And I think that that's one of the areas that I'm the most excited about. The third area is really our Workers' business, which is our developer platform. And in that in that space, it really depends on what's going on increasingly, we're doing takeouts from object store where people are moving data off of more traditional object stores onto R2 which is our object store. But a lot of times, we're also just moving, individual applications or individual functions, to us. And so it's not a complete displacement. Oftentimes people will use us alongside a more traditional hyperscale public cloud. But we can see that working together. In the AI space, in particular, I think that, again, it's such a new space that I don't know that we're displacing people as much as we're just helping AI companies get what they need. And the two big areas around that are first around training where GPU scarcity is significant and the cost with the traditional hyperscale public clouds and moving data to wherever there\u2019s cheap GPU capacity or even available GPU capacity, makes it cost prohibitive. And so R2, because we don't charge for egress, has been just a real boon for a lot of AI companies to be able to adopt wherever they can find the cheapest GPU at any moment in time. And that again, it\u2019s an area where a lot of that growth has come from. And then increasingly, we think that the inference market is really going to be fought between two areas. One is going to be on your device itself. If you have a driverless car, you don't want when a ball is bouncing down the street and the kid is chasing after it, for that decision on whether or not to put on the brakes to have to go out to the network now. You want that to live in the car itself. And so a lot of inference and models can be run on devices. But we think if they're not a run on devices, if they have -- if they're too large, if they need too much capacity, from either a GPU or memory or network access space, in those cases, it's going to make sense to run it in the network itself. And in that sense, Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to win in that inference market for those models that make sense not to run on the device themselves, the more complicated model that makes sense to run in -- out at the edge of the network. And that's exactly what we're starting to see from more and more of these really innovative AI startups.\nShaul Eyal: Got it. Thank you so much. Speak to you all.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Thomas, I had a question for you. Obviously, good results this quarter. And there was a lot of optimism in your portion of the prepared remarks. You talked about, sort of like better win rates, shorter deal cycles, et cetera. When I look though at sort of the sequential growth for Q3 and Q4, it's a bit higher than what we saw in the first half. I just -- what are some of those main factors that are giving you sort of increased optimism for the second half? And does guidance assume that macro stay constant or maybe even improve a little bit?\nThomas Seifert: Well, thank you, Matt. We saw the first data points that, what you call it, made me be a bit more optimistic. We think -- we still think, we need to apply a good portion of caution to our outlook. One data point doesn't really make a trend. At this point, we do not assume that the macroeconomic environment is improving significantly. We still see significant mixed macroeconomic data points that we factored into our guidance. And then therefore, it sets -- data as we said, prudent and cautious, not over-interpreting just on one data point.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Sort of double clicking on the strength that you saw this quarter, there was a lot of conversation about, shorter sales cycles, better win rates. Have you noticed any quantifiable benefit from your new CRO, Marc, as he's come on board and maybe improved sort of the sales focus?\nThomas Seifert: We're making good progress, both in terms of restructuring our team, in terms of adapting our tactics and strategies, how we move upmarket. But you have to remind -- remember that, bringing on team new people takes ramp time, a little bit shorter in the mid-market, a little bit longer in the enterprise segment. We have not seen most of those improvements yet, and we do not expect to see them over the -- over the course of the remainder of this year. So we are making really good progress, but, we've been cautious in terms of what we've factored in, in the guidance that we've given for the second half.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Trevor Walsh with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Matthew, just for you, first. A lot of the comments around AI seems to focus more around the developer piece and Workers specifically, which you kind of have as your part of your Act 3. Does that become more something accelerated into more of Act 2 for that part of the platform? Can you just maybe talk a little bit about kind of the, changes of the game from that perspective?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. Thanks, Trevor. I think that -- I mean, I think that the order of the acts is pretty -- is, I would still say Act 1 is application security, Act 2 is Zero Trust and Act 3 is Workers. But I would say that we have been very pleasantly surprised at how quickly the Workers' platform is taking off. But we are not, at this time, optimizing that platform for how can we bring as many dollars out of it as possible. We think that studying developer platforms across history, what we've seen is what you really need is adoption. And so, what I'm encouraged by is that every single day, when new companies are starting, when new trends take off like AI has, that people are turning to this. And I think it's -- I don't think that this is a flash in the pan. This isn't a polyester kind of new wardrobe that that is going to look good for a little while, but quickly fade. This is something that's real, and we're seeing that more and more companies, more and more experienced developers are turning to the Workers' platform in order to be able to deliver something that they can't get from the traditional hyperscale public clouds. And so, I think that any great work of fiction or otherwise, that the -- some of the excitement often comes in the later chapters. And so I don't want to diminish it by saying that it's act three, but I -- and I think that there's a huge opportunity there. But I also don't want to lose the fact that we had many customers this year really dive into our Act 2 products and we're making incredible gains in that space as well. So I think we've got a really exciting second and third act.\nTrevor Walsh: Awesome. Thanks, Matthew. Appreciate the color. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Thomas. Of the 196 large customers that you added in the quarter, could you maybe provide a little bit of color around -- are those current customers crossing into that threshold or is there a preponderance or even, like, an even split of new customers kind of just landing of that size? Can you just give us maybe a general sense of kind of where that pool of customers is coming from?\nThomas Seifert: In in the past, it was pretty even, fifty-fifty between new customer sign on the defender expansions. I would say, in the last quarter specifically, we had probably a larger share of new customers signing up right beyond the $1 million. So it shifted slightly away from expansion into a new logo sign on.\nTrevor Walsh: Awesome. Great. Thanks again for taking the questions.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJohn Weidemoyer: Good afternoon. This is John Weidemoyer for Jonathan. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to get some clarification if I could on, in better state, your net retention rate, if I understood you correctly, you had indicated in your prepared remarks that the retention rate is a lagging indicator that should benefit from your go-to-market and sales replacement initiatives and such. But then I believe you also said that was impacted by large -- by the largest customer cohorts. I wouldn't expect large customers to be quite as impacted. I wouldn't think that large customers would be impacted so much by your sales or go-to-market because your existing customers or most a lot of them would be. Could you help me understand what -- how that would impact retention rate and what kind of some of the moving parts are there?\nThomas Seifert: All right. Well, just to make sure, the expansion rates stayed high. Expansion in the large customer cohort was a little bit lagging. That is what we already saw in the prior quarter. It's also one of the reasons for my previous answer that the large customer growth was pretty much coming more biased towards new logos than it was coming from expansion. Expansion, as I said in my prepared remarks, as far as the lagging indicator because it's pretty much a look back to the four prior quarters. That is what you compare to a sign on. So any movement we see in an existing quarter, will take time to show up in DNR. We see -- we think we are seeing bottoming of the DNR development. So we are quite for we'll move that upwards to where and beyond where we came from. But because we are so conservative in how we measure DNR, it\u2019s an all-in across all customer cohorts. It's very much a lagging indicator. So it will take a while before all the improvement that we are initiating in getting expansion going again will show up in DNR.\nJohn Weidemoyer: Okay. Thank you. And, if I could just ask for, you mentioned that some of these initiatives, you wouldn't expect to see the new sales folks who are not being fully productive through the end of the year. That makes sense. Can you talk about your progress on the implementation of the sales processes, kind of when -- where you might think you're halfway done, fully done, at what point in time and have you identified further process improvements since our last talk a quarter ago? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Yeah. So I'll take that. I think that Marc is doing a really great job looking across the organization. I think one of the things that we really highlighted last quarter was that we had, some underperformance across the org. And we addressed that. What I was -- that's I, over the course of the last three months, have kept very careful, sort of my fingers on the pulse of the organization, met with a ton of our team. And what I'm hearing from the team is that they're super invigorated. They appreciate the additional training and enablement that we've implemented. And that we're seeing, our sales team get the tools that they need in order to make sure that they can, close great deals. And we, again, still have very strong pipeline. And I think that, what you'll see is that, that gets reflected as we have those new reps that are coming on as we do more enablement with our existing reps. And that I think is something that's very bullish for what we have going forward.\nJohn Weidemoyer: Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Good afternoon. Matthew, if you take your crystal ball out in the second half of the year, I'm just curious if you feel things are starting to slowly improve? It seems like a lot of your security peers are starting to see some decay and perhaps you're gaining some share here relative to your architecture and the platform. I'm curious if you can kind of maybe stitch the back half together and how you see it at a 40,000-foot view.\nMatthew Prince: Yeah. I don't know how accurate my crystal ball is. But I think that -- I wouldn't say that it feels like things are improving. It feels like things are plateauing. Q1 was really hard. The fact that we had in one quarter sales cycles increase 20% was a very big and frightening occurrence. And I think that, we were pretty early in earning seasons to call that, that there was a real concern across IT buyers, but that got reflected by many companies that came after us. What we saw in Q2 was that sales cycles returned back to be more in line with what we were seeing last year in 2022. 2022 was still elevated in the several years, prior to that. So what it feels like to me is that we're in for a grind. And, not Cloudflare in particular, but across the entire economy. And that that grind is going to be hard, but I think it's it is actually serving us quite well because it's forcing us towards operational excellence. And across our entire team, people are digging in, they're working hard, and they're making sure that every process is as efficient as possible. And I think that you're right. One of the things that is unique about us versus a number of others is, as we look at our products that we've been able to achieve very high gross margins, I think that's the best -- one of the best indicators that we have a really differentiated platform. And as customers are looking for ways to consolidate their vendors, to find how to get more ROI out of everything they're doing, they are turning to us, and our team is ready, and we have the right products. And so I think the grind that's ahead is actually something that -- it's going to be hard, but it's something that I think I'm looking forward to, and we're going to become a better company as a result of it.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and definitely glad to hear things are stabilizing. Matt, I still want to dig into, the comment that you made, both in the press release and on the conference call about, Workers and Cloudflare being a really good platform for inference. Can you talk to us about sort of the underlying technical why of -- why you think? It's still pretty early days with these technologies, and we're trying to figure out how inference plays out over time. So, I think your view would be helpful to the overall kind of industry conversation as well as the Cloudflare conversation on why you guys are well positioned. And then the follow-up is for Thomas. Whenever we hear inference, we're thinking that this is GPU intensive and computing intensive type stuff and typically lower gross margin. It sounds like you're pretty comfortable that this isn't impacting the gross margins in the near term. Is that just because it's still relatively early days and relatively small volumes, or should we be thinking that this could, as this ramps, this could potentially have a bigger gross margin impact over time? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: So, Keith, I appreciate both questions. They're really, really important to understand the advantages that we have in this space. So first of all, what are the challenges with inference? And I think there are really two. One seems like a bigger deal and is probably actually not as big a deal. And the other doesn't seem like it's a bigger deal, but it is a really big deal. And in both, I think that they, shape how we think the inference market is going to work out. So the one that kind of feels like it's a bigger deal is around performance, which is that if you're playing with the various generative AI companies, if you're trying to do something, that wait time between when you submit a query and when you get back a response, that's going to become a bigger and bigger differentiator between different AI platforms. And so anything that you can do in order to make that performance as fast as possible is advantageous. And one of the ways to do that is to move the actual inference as close as possible to the person who's requesting it. And so, again, we think that inference will primarily be done on device or very close to where the end user is, inside the network. We won't get, again, if the ball is bouncing across street, you want that inference to be done on the device, on the driverless car itself. So we won't win every inference task. But there will be a lot that makes sense to be running in the network where we have, again, almost infinite network capacity, almost infinite storage and memory and very, very significant, CPU and GPU resources to be able to run those inference tasks. That I actually think will be the lesser of the two advantages, for us. The larger one, which again doesn't feel like it's a bigger deal, but we're already seeing it play out some of the regulatory efforts that are happening around the world is that a lot of times for these inference tasks, the data that there is very private. People and governments want that to stay as close to the actual end user as possible. So we've already seen action in Italy that has restricted the use of certain AI tools because it sends data out of the country. What Cloudflare can uniquely do because we're positioned across more than 250 cities worldwide, we are in the vast majority of countries worldwide is that we can actually process that information locally. So again, we think that on device we are very close to where the user is on Cloudflare\u2019s network, is going to be the place where inference going to take place. I'll take a quick stab at your second question as well and then hand it off to Thomas for anything that he would add. [Technical Difficulty]\nKeith Weiss: One clarification. So in that world view, you, it sounds like you think we're going to see more kind of smaller open source and distribution of a lot of very small model versus, like, a world view that everything is going to come up into a big GPT or LaMDA model over time. Is that correct?\nMatthew Prince: Not necessarily, but we run enough capacity see out at the edge of our network that we can run fairly large, I mean, very large models out at our network. And what I think is a little bit confusing is most of, if you're trying to do the training of the models, then having the absolute latest, greatest GPU, the H100 from Nvidia right now, there's a lot of constraint in getting those chips. But there's actually a sweet spot for inference tasks, which isn't necessarily at the absolute cutting edge of the models. And so Cloudflare is not the right place to actually process the training of models. That's -- that makes much more sense to do in a more traditional, centralized data center model, much like much of the traditional hyper scale public clouds. And in those cases, you have to have the latest, greatest GPUs. But when you're doing inference, again, a lot of that's going to run on your device. And a lot of that is also going to run inside the network. And we're going to be able to, with a much lower capex spend, leverage the edge of our network, in order to be able to do that processing extremely efficiently. And maybe we don't need the H100. Maybe we can live within A100 or you know, whatever is, again, a generation or two behind. But that's also the difference between training and inference. An inference doesn't need necessarily the latest greatest GPU. Does that make sense?\nKeith Weiss: Yeah, super helpful. Thank you.\nThomas Seifert: Keith, what I would add is, I always remind people to truly understand the competitive mode of Cloudflare and the efficiency of there, the business model. You have to start with a network and how it's efficiently targeted using off-the-shelf hardware, completely integrated homogeneous software stack that allows you to run every product on every server and every location. So if this now massive globally distributed network that is not only efficiently designed to hard to handle large volumes of data, but also large volumes of simultaneous requests. And that makes it already today very well suited for inference tasks, which by nature often works to processing a request simultaneously. So -- and it requires less computational power than the training model. So I think the architecture of the network itself puts us in this really advantageous position. And that's why we are so confident that the business model is going to hold, and it's one of the reasons why we're able to -- AI\u2019s CapEx ratio down for the year despite the fact that AI workloads are putting -- are being put more and more on our network. So you really have to, as I always say, go back and really send the efficient architecture of the network itself, and you'll find the answer there.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Super interesting guys. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you. And congrats on another, great quarter. I wanted to shift gears and ask about Zero Trust. Is there any more details you could provide on record Zero Trust contract you talked about and whether that was a displacement of another vendor and maybe why they selected Cloudflare. And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Sure. I think that in almost all of the Zero Trust deals that we see, we are at least in competition with, some of the first generation Zero Trust vendors. In many of them, it's -- they are -- there's an incumbent vendor, and we are displacing them. Usually, when that happens, it's because the usability of the existing Zero Trust vendor has been really bad. It's crazy that with the some of the leading Zero Trust vendors, if you try to use your laptop when you're on a United Airlines Wi-Fi flight, that the captive portal on United Airlines doesn't work. That -- that's obviously unacceptable -- maybe that was acceptable in the pandemic when no one was traveling, but now that people are traveling, that's something that just doesn't hold up anymore. And so I think the thing that has been an advantage of Cloudflare is that because we almost think of ourselves at times as a consumer company and we have a Zero Trust product that you can download to your phone right now and use 1.1.1.1, that is been running on so many millions of devices. And as we work with device manufacturers to actually build our network directly into their application. Those things give us visibility to be able to focus on performance, to be able to focus on end user experience, and to be able to directly replace oftentimes, what have been those sort of first generation, Zero Trust vendors that frankly don't have the same user experience and the same performance. And so, in many of these cases, in all the cases, we\u2019re at least competing with the other more traditional Zero Trust vendors. And in many cases now, we're displacing them.\nAndrew Nowinski: That's great. Thank you, Matthew. And then as a follow-up, I think most people assume that Microsoft's new Entrust solutions will be targeted at that SMB sector at the lower end of the market, but that is a market that I think Cloudflare can also console serve. So I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of competition with the new Entrust solutions.\nMatthew Prince: Yeah. That's my sense of how Microsoft is thinking about this. And in fact, Microsoft's long been a really great partner of ours. And specifically in even their announcements of this, we looked for ways to actually highlight the part of the market that's the SMB market. But, we're not satisfied just winning the SMB market. We're winning some of the enterprises. And I think the biggest enterprises that have the most interest here. And so I think Microsoft has been a partner to Cloudflare. We are directly integrated into their Edge browser. The network that we have delivers them very unique benefits, but we also respect them as a competitor. And so I think what we have as an advantage is that network, a network that they use themselves but it's something where, over time, I think their entry into the market has just validated the market. It's defined it, and we look forward to competing in the places that we do and co-operating in any other places where we don't. And what we see is that, what customers really want is a network provider that can protect your front door and your back door. What customers really understand is that there's a reason that we have accountants and auditors, and those are separate things. And that -- what customers really want is they want a solution that works across not just one vendor's products, but the entire IT stack. And I think that's what we see time and time again as the reason why customers are selecting Cloudflare Zero Trust solutions.\nAndrew Nowinski: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we will take our question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you, and I\u2019ll add my congrats. Matthew, can you elaborate on your vision for how Cloudflare can protect companies from leaking sensitive data out and maybe having some of that land inside a generative AI model. What kind of opportunity do you see? And since that traffic to Microsoft and OpenAI is so tremendous in that area, and you have the partnerships there that you've mentioned, is there a role you can play directly to try to help control some of the data flows in that Azure OpenAI service?\nMatthew Prince: Yeah, I think that, this is an area that -- we really listened to what customers' concerns were and built a product that specifically addresses the concern that you're highlighting. Because it's one that is on the mind of just about every GC and CISO that's out there. And that is that -- whether they're telling their employers or not, the best data is that almost half of Workers that in knowledge industry companies are using AI in one way or another in their jobs. And the risk with AI is that if you send a piece of information up to one of these models, it gets incorporated in the same way that, if your two-year-old hears a bad word, it's really hard to get them to unlearn that thing. And so the key is really making sure that the data doesn't actually leave. And so what we've created is leveraging our existing data loss protection products, the DLP products, and making them specific to tag data in such a way that you can say, here's a piece of information, maybe it's from our marketing website. I am totally fine with that going out to the public, Zero Trust -- actually, not Zero Trust, out to this public AI vendors and being able to train on that. In fact, it's great if they're trained on my marketing messages. Here's another piece of information which is much more sensitive, where maybe I'm going to restrict that specifically to my own internal or sandboxed solutions that are the AI training models for that. And then maybe there's something else, that sort of cliche example is the secret formula of Coca Cola or maybe what all of your internal pay schemes are. Maybe that you don't ever want to get out to anything. And so we've used our DLP solutions in order to specifically address the concern that CISOs and general councils have about data leaking out. And what we think that that can do is over time add not only those controls, but then start to add things like this particular task has a certain value, so I'm going to send that to maybe GPT 3.5 rather than GPT 4 to save money on that. And so we think that because of the position we're in, because so much of the AI universe relies on us, that it puts us in a great position to not only provide security to the AI companies, but also provide security to anyone who is using AI in their business, and so we can benefit from both sides of the equation.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. It's extremely helpful.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thanks so much. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the fairly massive change in tone between the 1Q call and the current call, which highlights an improvement in pretty much every metric that you track? And specifically maybe call out some of the differences between various geographies, whether the improvement was in large enterprise, was it also in the mid-market and the SMB market? Can you give us some granularity as to where that tone is changing, because ultimately, you've called out that you're, one of the advanced [indiscernible] over the last year. And if, you're seeing that change in inflection and tone, would love to know where it is coming from?\nMatthew Prince: Yeah, Alex. I'll start and then Thomas will have some more. I think that -- I think that Q1 was scary, because having a 20% increase in your sales cycle in a single quarter, I mean, we've seen sort of a -- or something around that, around 20% of an increase, but over the entire course of 2022. And so when that then spiked in Q1, what we didn't know was whether that was going to -- whether we were going to be another 20% longer in sales cycles in Q2. And thankfully, that's not what happened. It came back down. But again, I wouldn't say that it's come back down to a point where we feel super optimistic and -- about the macro. I think the macro still very hard and that the next period of time is going to be a grind. But it is -- we didn't have the same just explosive expansion in sales cycles that I think we and a lot of other peers in the industry saw in Q1. And so I think that's what -- that has been, that's what led to the conservatism that we had in Q1. And I think that that returning to something, which, again, is still elevated, but not, but is back to what we were seeing in Q -- or around what we're seeing in Q4, that is, I think that's the primary driver at least from my perspective in terms of what -- maybe is what you put it as a as a more optimistic tone.\nAlex Henderson: Any sense of -- specifically any verticals or any categories or geographies, or any size business, that changed most dramatically?\nThomas Seifert: Let me give you some more color. We saw a lot -- we saw forward improvement. We talked about this. We also saw a lot of inconsistencies in this -- in the environment that made it much harder to predict what the second half is going to carry. APAC was very promising as we said before, we saw a lot of very large deals, especially coming from APAC. The European business was very much security driven and very encouraging, probably because of the very specific geopolitical situation Europe is in. And then the Americas were more muted in general. We saw very specific, performance, really good performance in the Middle East, but also in South America, and North America was probably more muted than anything else. Vertical wise, there's not a lot to talk about it. But it was very consistent performance I would say. There's not one vertical that I would pick out in terms of overall underperformance.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the conference back to Matthew Prince for closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: Just want to take a second to thank everyone at Cloudflare. Again, as the macro environment continues to be challenging, I'm proud of how our team has stepped up and executed towards operational excellence. Everyone is working incredibly hard to help live up to our mission of helping build a better internet. So thank you to all the Cloudflare employees, to all of our customers and to all of the investors and we really appreciate everything that you're doing for us.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew. And thank you to everyone for joining us. During the second quarter, I'm pleased to share that we've seen improvements in terms of the impact from the external challenges that we highlighted last quarter. Specifically, also still somewhat elevated from historical levels, sales cycles shortened in part due to the implementation of more efficient processes and tactics. Our pipeline close rates have also shown improvement as we continue to refine our go-to-market strategies and operations. Furthermore, we observed a notable uptick in collections on our accounts receivable, which we believe reflects a rebound in customer confidence and financial stability. We also continue to maintain our strong commitment to being fully responsible and act as good stewards of investors' capital. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of record operating profit. We also prudently allocated capital with a focus on maximizing shareholder value by taking action to retire our 2025 convertible notes during the second quarter. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 32% year-over-year to $308.5 million. From a geographic perspective, the US represented 53% of revenue, and increased 30% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 38% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 23% year-over-year. We were pleased to see notable performance in the EMEA and APAC regions with both achieving record new ACV bookings in the second quarter. The strength in APAC was primarily driven by large customer deals, and we are seeing security become an even higher priority in EMEA given the geopolitical situation in the region. Turning to our customer metrics. In the second quarter, we had 174,129 paying customers, representing an increase of 15% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 2,352 large customers, representing an increase of 34% year-over-year and an addition of 196 large customers in the quarter. In fact, we added a record number of customers spending more than $500,000 on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. And the second quarter was also one of our highest quarterly additions of customers, spending more than $1 million annually, including our largest Zero Trust contract to date. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 115% during the second quarter, representing a decrease of 200 basis points sequentially. Importantly, renewal rates in the second quarter were consistent with the quarterly average in 2022, which was an all-time high for the company. Instead, similar to the last two quarters, the decline in DNR was again primarily driven by slower expansion in our larger customer cohort. We calculate DNR by comparing the analyzed revenue from paying customers four quarters prior to the annualized revenue from the same set of customers in the most recent quarter. As a result, this will be a lagging indicator of Cloudflare's underlying business trends. Based on our visibility, we believe the deceleration in DNR is nearing a bottom. Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 77.7%, representing a decrease of 10 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 120 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 11% of revenue in the second quarter. For fiscal 2023, we now expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue, underscoring the scalability and efficiency of our network even as we onboard new workloads, including AI. Turning to the operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased by 8% year-over-year to 71%. Our total number of employees increased 11% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to 3,389 at the end of the quarter. During the second quarter, we addressed consistently low performing sales capacity with a focus on upgrading our customer facing talents to improve growth, increase productivity and drive long-term success. We will continue to pace hiring for the year based on market conditions and remain committed to raising the bar on new high additions given talent opportunities available in the market. Sales and marketing expenses were $125.4 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percent of revenue decreased by 1% sequentially and decreased to 41% from 44% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $53 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1% sequentially and decreased to 17% from 20% in the same quarter last year. G&A expenses were $41 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue increased 1% sequentially and decreased to 13% from 15% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $20.3 million compared to an operating loss of $891,000 in the same period last year. Second quarter operating margin was 6.6%, an increase of 700 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive, not just during the currently uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, but also because operational efficiency is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $33.7 million or a diluted net income per share of $0.10. We ended the second quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $20 million in the second quarter or 6% of revenue compared to negative $4.4 million or 2% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations or RPO came in at $1 billion, representing an increase of 8% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. Before moving to guidance for the third quarter and full year, I would like to begin with our expectations and the provisions we have factored into this outlook. Despite being encouraged by the forward progress we delivered during the second quarter in terms of shortening sales cycles and improving close rates, mixed macroeconomic data points serve as a reminder that we are operating in a business environment that thought showing signs of stabilization, continue to be challenging to predict. As a result, we remain prudent and cautious in our outlook for the second half of the year and we are fully committed to continuing to adapt our tactics and strategies in response to these external variables. Now turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $330 million to $331 million, representing an increase of 30% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $20 million to $21 million and we expect diluted net income per share of $0.10, assuming approximately 347 million shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 11%. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.283 billion to $1.287 billion, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $81 million to $85 million. And we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.37, assuming approximately 345 million shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 9% for 2023. After having achieved positive free cash flow in the second half of last year and again, during both the first and second quarters of this year, we anticipate generating significant free cash flow for the full year 2023. For modeling purposes, we continue to expect free cash flow to trend upward on an ongoing basis, but anticipate variability in our free cash flow generation quarter to quarter. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers, and partners. And to our shareholders, we greatly value your continued support. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Well, thank you, Matt. We saw the first data points that, what you call it, made me be a bit more optimistic. We think -- we still think, we need to apply a good portion of caution to our outlook. One data point doesn't really make a trend. At this point, we do not assume that the macroeconomic environment is improving significantly. We still see significant mixed macroeconomic data points that we factored into our guidance. And then therefore, it sets -- data as we said, prudent and cautious, not over-interpreting just on one data point. We're making good progress, both in terms of restructuring our team, in terms of adapting our tactics and strategies, how we move upmarket. But you have to remind -- remember that, bringing on team new people takes ramp time, a little bit shorter in the mid-market, a little bit longer in the enterprise segment. We have not seen most of those improvements yet, and we do not expect to see them over the -- over the course of the remainder of this year. So we are making really good progress, but, we've been cautious in terms of what we've factored in, in the guidance that we've given for the second half. In in the past, it was pretty even, fifty-fifty between new customer sign on the defender expansions. I would say, in the last quarter specifically, we had probably a larger share of new customers signing up right beyond the $1 million. So it shifted slightly away from expansion into a new logo sign on. All right. Well, just to make sure, the expansion rates stayed high. Expansion in the large customer cohort was a little bit lagging. That is what we already saw in the prior quarter. It's also one of the reasons for my previous answer that the large customer growth was pretty much coming more biased towards new logos than it was coming from expansion. Expansion, as I said in my prepared remarks, as far as the lagging indicator because it's pretty much a look back to the four prior quarters. That is what you compare to a sign on. So any movement we see in an existing quarter, will take time to show up in DNR. We see -- we think we are seeing bottoming of the DNR development. So we are quite for we'll move that upwards to where and beyond where we came from. But because we are so conservative in how we measure DNR, it's an all-in across all customer cohorts. It's very much a lagging indicator. So it will take a while before all the improvement that we are initiating in getting expansion going again will show up in DNR. Keith, what I would add is, I always remind people to truly understand the competitive mode of Cloudflare and the efficiency of there, the business model. You have to start with a network and how it's efficiently targeted using off-the-shelf hardware, completely integrated homogeneous software stack that allows you to run every product on every server and every location. So if this now massive globally distributed network that is not only efficiently designed to hard to handle large volumes of data, but also large volumes of simultaneous requests. And that makes it already today very well suited for inference tasks, which by nature often works to processing a request simultaneously. So -- and it requires less computational power than the training model. So I think the architecture of the network itself puts us in this really advantageous position. And that's why we are so confident that the business model is going to hold, and it's one of the reasons why we're able to -- AI's CapEx ratio down for the year despite the fact that AI workloads are putting -- are being put more and more on our network. So you really have to, as I always say, go back and really send the efficient architecture of the network itself, and you'll find the answer there. Let me give you some more color. We saw a lot -- we saw forward improvement. We talked about this. We also saw a lot of inconsistencies in this -- in the environment that made it much harder to predict what the second half is going to carry. APAC was very promising as we said before, we saw a lot of very large deals, especially coming from APAC. The European business was very much security driven and very encouraging, probably because of the very specific geopolitical situation Europe is in. And then the Americas were more muted in general. We saw very specific, performance, really good performance in the Middle East, but also in South America, and North America was probably more muted than anything else. Vertical wise, there's not a lot to talk about it. But it was very consistent performance I would say. There's not one vertical that I would pick out in terms of overall underperformance."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Phil. We had a strong quarter in spite of continued macroeconomic uncertainty. In Q2, we achieved revenue of $308.5 million, up 32% year-over-year. We added 196 new large customers, those that pay us more than a $100,000 per year and now have 2,352 large customers, up 34% year-over-year. Our focus on go-to-market improvements is already paying off. After we saw sales cycles increase 20% in Q1, disciplined around deals had them return to levels closer to what we saw last year. While our customers and prospects continue to be very careful around their IT spend, our improved execution led to a record quarter in new ACV bookings. My sense, talking to customers is that while the macro environment is still challenging, it is stabilized. And for the first time in several quarters, sentiment among IT buyers does not appear to be getting worse. Our dollar-based net retention ticked down to a 115%, down 2% quarter-over-quarter. Dollar-based net retention is a lagging indicator. So it will be slower to reflect the go-to-market improvements we are seeing. It's also important to note that we did not see any new competitive pressure or churn throughout the quarter. Instead, the lower dollar-based net retention is due to slower expansion from some of our existing customers. We expect that our focus on go-to-market operational excellence will improve this metric over time. Our gross margin held stable at 77.7%, still above our long-term target of 75% to 77% and in line with 77.8% last quarter. We delivered an operating profit of $20.3 million, our fourth consecutive quarter with a record operating profit. We also meaningfully outperformed on free cash flow, generating $20 million during the quarter, which represents a free cash flow margin of 6.5%. I'm proud that our team has proven we can not only execute in good times, but also be disciplined and deliver operational improvements while we're in more challenging times. We continue to see very strong pipeline growth. Q2 was another record for new pipeline generation. As we discussed last quarter, we made significant changes in our sales team to proactively address underperformance. That went very well, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our top performers are invigorated. We saw a marked improvement in the average account executive productivity. At the same time, we've implemented robust onboarding, enablement, and training programs. Combined with the record number of applicants we're seeing for sales roles, this makes for the right formula to build a worldclass sales organization. And our team is armed with great products to sell. Last quarter alone, Forrester recognized Area 1, our email security product, as a leader. IDC recognized us as the leader for two reports, in Zero Trust and network edge security-as-a-service, and we were the only new vendor recognized by Gartner for Secure Service Edge. Our developer platform, Cloudflare Workers, continues its explosive growth. We reached 10 million active Workers applications in Q2, up 250% since December and 490% year-over-year. R2 continues to grow and now stores over 13 petabytes of customer data, up 85% quarter-over-quarter. We have 44,000 distinct paying customers with R2 subscription, and brand name customers are beginning to adopt it as their primary object storage solution. That seems like a good segue to name some other customer wins in the quarter. One of the fastest growing generative AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $1.7 million contract, less than a year after first starting to use our platform. Like many AI companies in the space, this customer relies on a multi-cloud architecture for training and processing requests. R2 lets them unlock the best prices and performance across multiple cloud providers. In their words, \u201cWe see Cloudflare as a strategic foundational glue across all our services. Cloudflare continues to be our best strategic partner of all partners.\u201d That's great to hear from many customers, but it's especially fun coming from a company that's doing such cutting-edge work. These days feel like membership in the CEO club is predicated on saying AI as many times as possible in your earnings call script. I have to confess, I still find it a bit awkward. When we first pitched Cloudflare to venture capitalists back in 2010, at one point, I described us as, \u201cThe first AI powered security company for the cloud.\u201d The eye rolls around the table were so intense that I'm still a bit scared. But more than a decade later, here we are. And by our estimates, Cloudflare is the most commonly used cloud provider across the leading AI startups. They're using R2 to help arbitrage the lowest GPU cost to train their models. They're using our security tools themselves powered by AI or what our team would prefer to call machine learning to protect their own AI systems. And increasingly, they're using the edge of our network to perform inference. We are continuing to invest in this area and believe that we are uniquely positioned to win the inference market, which we believe will be substantially larger than the AI training market. In Q2, we hosted our Developer Week, highlighting 10 major announcements and features to extend Cloudflare Workers as the preeminent developer platform for the leading AI company. Q3 will feature our annual birthday week, and we have a lot more in store to provide picks and shovels to enable AI companies to build the future. Beyond AI, Cloudflare's Zero Trust Solutions were another big winner in Q2. A Fortune 500 technology services company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $7.2 million contract for 25,000 Zero Trustees. That brought their annual spend with us to over $5 million. They first became a customer in Q3 last year using our application security products. Six months into the deployment, one of their senior executives said, \u201cCloudflare is like magic and brought us into an ongoing competitive Zero Trust proof of concept.\u201d Cloudflare's existing gateway products were chosen over first generation Zero Trust competitors due to our rate of innovation and ability to consolidate all their security onto a single pane of glass. One of the largest online recruiting platforms expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a 25-month $2.4 million contract and bringing their annual spend over $5 million. With more than 90% of their employees remote, they were looking for a comprehensive Zero Trust solution and evaluated us against every leading vendor in the market. They decided to go all in on Cloudflare with 15,000 seats for access, gateway, CASB, data loss prevention, browser isolation, and Area 1 email security. I'm especially proud of how quickly we were able to onboard them, less than a month to fully replace their first generation Zero Trust vendor. That's awesome. An Australian technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year $2.2 million contract, bringing their total spend with us to over $5 million. This customer started out on our pay as you go plan in 2016 This quarter, they signed a Zero Trust deal to protect their expanding workforce. They're also broadening their use of Cloudflare's developer platform with both R2 and Durable Objects. Sticking down under, a leading Australian healthcare provider expanded their relationship with us, signing a three-year $2.8 million contract. We are replacing their hodgepodge of first generation Zero Trust vendors with 12,000 seats of access, gateway, browser isolation, CASB, data loss protection, and Area 1 email security. This is another example of a customer looking to consolidate vendors and choosing Cloudflare for their holistic network security solution. Here's another cool one. A Fortune 500 social network expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $2.4 million contract. They initially became a customer a year ago, building on top of Workers and using our global network to authenticate the security of one of their messaging products. They approached us again looking to add increased privacy onto another product with our Privacy Gateway solution. They view Cloudflare as a leader in privacy based on our co-development of the Oblivious HTTP standard, and they admire us as one of the only other companies that truly understand scale. As privacy is increasingly top of mind, we believe there will be more and more of these sort of strategically beneficial relationships. I think I've only said AI 11 times so far, putting me way behind Satya. So let me end with one more AI customer win. Another generative AI company expanded their relationship with us, signing a three-year $1.3 million contract. They came to us for our developer platform, signing up as a pay-as-you-go customer. Because their developers loved us, they approached us about a security need and signed a deal to use our application security and Zero Trust products. They're only 100 seats, but they're growing like crazy and building Cloudflare deep into their whole stack. Whether you're a Fortune 500 industrial company that used us for application security and are now hiring AI developers to use our Workers' platform to drive innovation across your business or you're a 100 person AI startup that started using our developer platform and then realized you can get the same security as the biggest Fortune 500 companies, that's what's really unique about Cloudflare. We've built the cloud that connects the world securely, reliably, and efficiently. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. Yeah, Shaul. I really appreciate the question. We've had a lot of noise on the line from the operator. So hopefully, we can get things muted. Apologies for that. So I think that when we look at displacement, it really is across three different parts of our business. So the first area is our conditional application security business. And in that space, we continue to place -- displace a number of traditional hardware vendors, the people who are providing web application firewalls, load balancers, funding various services that people had in those in those areas. We also see point cloud solutions that are doing just one of those things, getting displaced by us where we can very much pick up a significant amount of their business. And that -- that's been the case for quite some time. In our -- the second part of our business, which is our Zero Trust business, the first is sort of the front door of your business, the second is kind of the back door of your business. The Zero Trust business is about protecting employees and data. In that case, we're more and more going head-to-head with the other first generation Zero Trust providers. So the Zscalers, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco Umbrellas of the world. And, again, we really like our win rates in this space. And in a number of the examples that I cited, we were specifically, either in competitive solutions there, or in some cases where we were actually doing takeouts, people who have made bets on the first generation of Zero Trust providers and wanted to upgrade to us for, better ROI, a much better user experience, much faster, more performant network. And I think that that's one of the areas that I'm the most excited about. The third area is really our Workers' business, which is our developer platform. And in that in that space, it really depends on what's going on increasingly, we're doing takeouts from object store where people are moving data off of more traditional object stores onto R2 which is our object store. But a lot of times, we're also just moving, individual applications or individual functions, to us. And so it's not a complete displacement. Oftentimes people will use us alongside a more traditional hyperscale public cloud. But we can see that working together. In the AI space, in particular, I think that, again, it's such a new space that I don't know that we're displacing people as much as we're just helping AI companies get what they need. And the two big areas around that are first around training where GPU scarcity is significant and the cost with the traditional hyperscale public clouds and moving data to wherever there's cheap GPU capacity or even available GPU capacity, makes it cost prohibitive. And so R2, because we don't charge for egress, has been just a real boon for a lot of AI companies to be able to adopt wherever they can find the cheapest GPU at any moment in time. And that again, it's an area where a lot of that growth has come from. And then increasingly, we think that the inference market is really going to be fought between two areas. One is going to be on your device itself. If you have a driverless car, you don't want when a ball is bouncing down the street and the kid is chasing after it, for that decision on whether or not to put on the brakes to have to go out to the network now. You want that to live in the car itself. And so a lot of inference and models can be run on devices. But we think if they're not a run on devices, if they have -- if they're too large, if they need too much capacity, from either a GPU or memory or network access space, in those cases, it's going to make sense to run it in the network itself. And in that sense, Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to win in that inference market for those models that make sense not to run on the device themselves, the more complicated model that makes sense to run in -- out at the edge of the network. And that's exactly what we're starting to see from more and more of these really innovative AI startups. Sure. Thanks, Trevor. I think that -- I mean, I think that the order of the acts is pretty -- is, I would still say Act 1 is application security, Act 2 is Zero Trust and Act 3 is Workers. But I would say that we have been very pleasantly surprised at how quickly the Workers' platform is taking off. But we are not, at this time, optimizing that platform for how can we bring as many dollars out of it as possible. We think that studying developer platforms across history, what we've seen is what you really need is adoption. And so, what I'm encouraged by is that every single day, when new companies are starting, when new trends take off like AI has, that people are turning to this. And I think it's -- I don't think that this is a flash in the pan. This isn't a polyester kind of new wardrobe that that is going to look good for a little while, but quickly fade. This is something that's real, and we're seeing that more and more companies, more and more experienced developers are turning to the Workers' platform in order to be able to deliver something that they can't get from the traditional hyperscale public clouds. And so, I think that any great work of fiction or otherwise, that the -- some of the excitement often comes in the later chapters. And so I don't want to diminish it by saying that it's act three, but I -- and I think that there's a huge opportunity there. But I also don't want to lose the fact that we had many customers this year really dive into our Act 2 products and we're making incredible gains in that space as well. So I think we've got a really exciting second and third act. Yeah. So I'll take that. I think that Marc is doing a really great job looking across the organization. I think one of the things that we really highlighted last quarter was that we had, some underperformance across the org. And we addressed that. What I was -- that's I, over the course of the last three months, have kept very careful, sort of my fingers on the pulse of the organization, met with a ton of our team. And what I'm hearing from the team is that they're super invigorated. They appreciate the additional training and enablement that we've implemented. And that we're seeing, our sales team get the tools that they need in order to make sure that they can, close great deals. And we, again, still have very strong pipeline. And I think that, what you'll see is that, that gets reflected as we have those new reps that are coming on as we do more enablement with our existing reps. And that I think is something that's very bullish for what we have going forward. Yeah. I don't know how accurate my crystal ball is. But I think that -- I wouldn't say that it feels like things are improving. It feels like things are plateauing. Q1 was really hard. The fact that we had in one quarter sales cycles increase 20% was a very big and frightening occurrence. And I think that, we were pretty early in earning seasons to call that, that there was a real concern across IT buyers, but that got reflected by many companies that came after us. What we saw in Q2 was that sales cycles returned back to be more in line with what we were seeing last year in 2022. 2022 was still elevated in the several years, prior to that. So what it feels like to me is that we're in for a grind. And, not Cloudflare in particular, but across the entire economy. And that that grind is going to be hard, but I think it's it is actually serving us quite well because it's forcing us towards operational excellence. And across our entire team, people are digging in, they're working hard, and they're making sure that every process is as efficient as possible. And I think that you're right. One of the things that is unique about us versus a number of others is, as we look at our products that we've been able to achieve very high gross margins, I think that's the best -- one of the best indicators that we have a really differentiated platform. And as customers are looking for ways to consolidate their vendors, to find how to get more ROI out of everything they're doing, they are turning to us, and our team is ready, and we have the right products. And so I think the grind that's ahead is actually something that -- it's going to be hard, but it's something that I think I'm looking forward to, and we're going to become a better company as a result of it. So, Keith, I appreciate both questions. They're really, really important to understand the advantages that we have in this space. So first of all, what are the challenges with inference? And I think there are really two. One seems like a bigger deal and is probably actually not as big a deal. And the other doesn't seem like it's a bigger deal, but it is a really big deal. And in both, I think that they, shape how we think the inference market is going to work out. So the one that kind of feels like it's a bigger deal is around performance, which is that if you're playing with the various generative AI companies, if you're trying to do something, that wait time between when you submit a query and when you get back a response, that's going to become a bigger and bigger differentiator between different AI platforms. And so anything that you can do in order to make that performance as fast as possible is advantageous. And one of the ways to do that is to move the actual inference as close as possible to the person who's requesting it. And so, again, we think that inference will primarily be done on device or very close to where the end user is, inside the network. We won't get, again, if the ball is bouncing across street, you want that inference to be done on the device, on the driverless car itself. So we won't win every inference task. But there will be a lot that makes sense to be running in the network where we have, again, almost infinite network capacity, almost infinite storage and memory and very, very significant, CPU and GPU resources to be able to run those inference tasks. That I actually think will be the lesser of the two advantages, for us. The larger one, which again doesn't feel like it's a bigger deal, but we're already seeing it play out some of the regulatory efforts that are happening around the world is that a lot of times for these inference tasks, the data that there is very private. People and governments want that to stay as close to the actual end user as possible. So we've already seen action in Italy that has restricted the use of certain AI tools because it sends data out of the country. What Cloudflare can uniquely do because we're positioned across more than 250 cities worldwide, we are in the vast majority of countries worldwide is that we can actually process that information locally. So again, we think that on device we are very close to where the user is on Cloudflare's network, is going to be the place where inference going to take place. I'll take a quick stab at your second question as well and then hand it off to Thomas for anything that he would add. [Technical Difficulty] Not necessarily, but we run enough capacity see out at the edge of our network that we can run fairly large, I mean, very large models out at our network. And what I think is a little bit confusing is most of, if you're trying to do the training of the models, then having the absolute latest, greatest GPU, the H100 from Nvidia right now, there's a lot of constraint in getting those chips. But there's actually a sweet spot for inference tasks, which isn't necessarily at the absolute cutting edge of the models. And so Cloudflare is not the right place to actually process the training of models. That's -- that makes much more sense to do in a more traditional, centralized data center model, much like much of the traditional hyper scale public clouds. And in those cases, you have to have the latest, greatest GPUs. But when you're doing inference, again, a lot of that's going to run on your device. And a lot of that is also going to run inside the network. And we're going to be able to, with a much lower capex spend, leverage the edge of our network, in order to be able to do that processing extremely efficiently. And maybe we don't need the H100. Maybe we can live within A100 or you know, whatever is, again, a generation or two behind. But that's also the difference between training and inference. An inference doesn't need necessarily the latest greatest GPU. Does that make sense? Sure. I think that in almost all of the Zero Trust deals that we see, we are at least in competition with, some of the first generation Zero Trust vendors. In many of them, it's -- they are -- there's an incumbent vendor, and we are displacing them. Usually, when that happens, it's because the usability of the existing Zero Trust vendor has been really bad. It's crazy that with the some of the leading Zero Trust vendors, if you try to use your laptop when you're on a United Airlines Wi-Fi flight, that the captive portal on United Airlines doesn't work. That -- that's obviously unacceptable -- maybe that was acceptable in the pandemic when no one was traveling, but now that people are traveling, that's something that just doesn't hold up anymore. And so I think the thing that has been an advantage of Cloudflare is that because we almost think of ourselves at times as a consumer company and we have a Zero Trust product that you can download to your phone right now and use 1.1.1.1, that is been running on so many millions of devices. And as we work with device manufacturers to actually build our network directly into their application. Those things give us visibility to be able to focus on performance, to be able to focus on end user experience, and to be able to directly replace oftentimes, what have been those sort of first generation, Zero Trust vendors that frankly don't have the same user experience and the same performance. And so, in many of these cases, in all the cases, we're at least competing with the other more traditional Zero Trust vendors. And in many cases now, we're displacing them. Yeah. That's my sense of how Microsoft is thinking about this. And in fact, Microsoft's long been a really great partner of ours. And specifically in even their announcements of this, we looked for ways to actually highlight the part of the market that's the SMB market. But, we're not satisfied just winning the SMB market. We're winning some of the enterprises. And I think the biggest enterprises that have the most interest here. And so I think Microsoft has been a partner to Cloudflare. We are directly integrated into their Edge browser. The network that we have delivers them very unique benefits, but we also respect them as a competitor. And so I think what we have as an advantage is that network, a network that they use themselves but it's something where, over time, I think their entry into the market has just validated the market. It's defined it, and we look forward to competing in the places that we do and co-operating in any other places where we don't. And what we see is that, what customers really want is a network provider that can protect your front door and your back door. What customers really understand is that there's a reason that we have accountants and auditors, and those are separate things. And that -- what customers really want is they want a solution that works across not just one vendor's products, but the entire IT stack. And I think that's what we see time and time again as the reason why customers are selecting Cloudflare Zero Trust solutions. Yeah, I think that, this is an area that -- we really listened to what customers' concerns were and built a product that specifically addresses the concern that you're highlighting. Because it's one that is on the mind of just about every GC and CISO that's out there. And that is that -- whether they're telling their employers or not, the best data is that almost half of Workers that in knowledge industry companies are using AI in one way or another in their jobs. And the risk with AI is that if you send a piece of information up to one of these models, it gets incorporated in the same way that, if your two-year-old hears a bad word, it's really hard to get them to unlearn that thing. And so the key is really making sure that the data doesn't actually leave. And so what we've created is leveraging our existing data loss protection products, the DLP products, and making them specific to tag data in such a way that you can say, here's a piece of information, maybe it's from our marketing website. I am totally fine with that going out to the public, Zero Trust -- actually, not Zero Trust, out to this public AI vendors and being able to train on that. In fact, it's great if they're trained on my marketing messages. Here's another piece of information which is much more sensitive, where maybe I'm going to restrict that specifically to my own internal or sandboxed solutions that are the AI training models for that. And then maybe there's something else, that sort of cliche example is the secret formula of Coca Cola or maybe what all of your internal pay schemes are. Maybe that you don't ever want to get out to anything. And so we've used our DLP solutions in order to specifically address the concern that CISOs and general councils have about data leaking out. And what we think that that can do is over time add not only those controls, but then start to add things like this particular task has a certain value, so I'm going to send that to maybe GPT 3.5 rather than GPT 4 to save money on that. And so we think that because of the position we're in, because so much of the AI universe relies on us, that it puts us in a great position to not only provide security to the AI companies, but also provide security to anyone who is using AI in their business, and so we can benefit from both sides of the equation. Yeah, Alex. I'll start and then Thomas will have some more. I think that -- I think that Q1 was scary, because having a 20% increase in your sales cycle in a single quarter, I mean, we've seen sort of a -- or something around that, around 20% of an increase, but over the entire course of 2022. And so when that then spiked in Q1, what we didn't know was whether that was going to -- whether we were going to be another 20% longer in sales cycles in Q2. And thankfully, that's not what happened. It came back down. But again, I wouldn't say that it's come back down to a point where we feel super optimistic and -- about the macro. I think the macro still very hard and that the next period of time is going to be a grind. But it is -- we didn't have the same just explosive expansion in sales cycles that I think we and a lot of other peers in the industry saw in Q1. And so I think that's what -- that has been, that's what led to the conservatism that we had in Q1. And I think that that returning to something, which, again, is still elevated, but not, but is back to what we were seeing in Q -- or around what we're seeing in Q4, that is, I think that's the primary driver at least from my perspective in terms of what -- maybe is what you put it as a as a more optimistic tone. Just want to take a second to thank everyone at Cloudflare. Again, as the macro environment continues to be challenging, I'm proud of how our team has stepped up and executed towards operational excellence. Everyone is working incredibly hard to help live up to our mission of helping build a better internet. So thank you to all the Cloudflare employees, to all of our customers and to all of the investors and we really appreciate everything that you're doing for us."

[Operator Instructions] And please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] \n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Phil Winslow, Vice President of Strategic Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nPhil Winslow: Thank you for joining us to discuss Cloudflare's financial results for the first quarter of 2023. With me on the call, we have Matthew Prince, Co-Founder and CEO; Michelle Zatlyn, Co-Founder, President and COO; and Thomas Seifert, CFO. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings announcement. This announcement as well as our supplemental financial information may be found on our Investor Relations website. \n As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements during today's discussion, including, but not limited to, our customers', vendors' and partners' operations and future financial performance, our anticipated product launches and the timing and market potential of those products, our anticipated future financial and operating performance, and our expectations regarding future macroeconomic conditions. These statements and other comments are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, much of which is beyond our control. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any of our forward-looking statements. \n These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact our future operating results and financial condition, please see our filings with the SEC as well as in today's earnings press release. \n Unless otherwise noted, all numbers we talk about today, other than revenue, will be on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. You'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that are included in our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. For historical periods, a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in the supplemental financial information referenced a few moments ago. \n We would also like to inform you that we will be participating in MoffettNathanson's inaugural TMT Conference on May 17 and Jefferies 2023 Software Conference on May 31.  \n Now before wrapping up, we are excited to host our Investor Day on Thursday, May 4, which is being held in conjunction with our user conference, Cloudflare Connect in New York City. A live webcast will also be accessible from our Investor Relations website. \n Now with that, I'd like to turn over the call to Matthew. \nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. Q1 was a quarter of contrast. We achieved revenue of $290.2 million, up 37% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 77.8%, again, above our long-term target range of 75% to 77% and up from 77.4% last quarter. During the quarter, we added 114 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 2,156 large customers, up 40% year-over-year. Our dollar-based net retention fell to 117%, down 5% quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, we did not see elevated churn across our broad customer base. Instead, we saw a slower expansion from existing customers. More on that in a second. \n Throughout this quarter of contrast, we saw tailwinds and headwinds. The reacceleration of our new business pipeline during the second half of 2022 continued again this quarter, and we meaningfully exceeded our pipeline plan for the second quarter in a row. Our win rate against the competition remained at record high levels, and renewal rates were consistent with the high levels experienced over the previous 4 quarters. Those were all positive signs. \n On the flip side, the quarter saw new challenges, macroeconomic uncertainty, which intensified over the course of Q1 with every failing bank resulted in a material lengthening of sales cycles, a significant decline in close rates, even as win rates held strong and an extreme back-end weighting to the quarter. To give you some sense, almost half of the new business closed in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, which is very nonlinear for us. All of these factors put pressure on growth. The quarter most reminded me of Q1 of 2020 when businesses were paralyzingly nervous about the impact of COVID-19. \n I think this parallel shows how with uncertainty in the economy, companies are closely watching their own businesses before committing to new spending. Thankfully, we continue to be a must-have, not a nice to have. And most of the deals we expected to close did, just later than we expected. I'm proud of our team's ability to sail through the rough seas that characterize Q1. \n Although the current economy poses uncertainty for nearly every business in the near term, as Mark Hawkins and our Board likes to say, when the going gets tough, the tough get profitable, and we are tough. We have our hands firmly on the tiller of our business and are able to adjust to rapidly evolving market conditions in order to deliver operating profit of $19.4 million, representing a record operating margin of 6.7%. Furthermore, in spite of tougher collections in the quarter, particularly in the month of March, we generated $13.9 million of free cash flow, representing a free cash flow margin of 5%. \n We continue to be on track to be free cash flow positive for 2023. As we navigate through the challenging macroeconomic seas facing our industry, this period of external uncertainty presents us with a perfect opportunity to be internally reflective, identifying areas of improvement within our business and taking proactive steps to create an even more successful and productive organization. As I take stock, we are not limited by the size of our market for our products, we are not limited by our ability to innovate, we are not limited by pipeline opportunity, and we are not limited by sales capacity. So what are we limited by? \n As I said last quarter, Marc Boroditsky, our new President of Revenue, has dug into retooling our go-to-market efforts and identified significant opportunities to improve the efficiency and performance of our sales teams. Although we've won 1/3 of the Fortune 500 customers, if we're honest with ourselves, we saw a lot of our success with our enterprise customers because our products were so good and solved real problems that every big company faces.  That allowed many on our sales team to succeed largely by just taking orders. When the fish are jumping right in the boat, you don't need to be a very good fishermen. \n But at the risk of mixing watering metaphors, as the tide goes out, you get a clear view who's not wearing shorts. The macroeconomic environment has gotten harder, and we're seeing that some on our team aren't dressed for work. Digging in with Marc, we've identified more than 100 people on our sales team who have consistently missed expectations. Simply put, a significant percentage of our sales force has been repeatedly underperforming based on measurable performance targets and critical KPIs. That's obviously a problem.  \n But it's won in this environment with a particularly available and actionable solution. We are now in the process of quickly rotating out those members of our team who have been underperforming and bringing in new talent with salespeople who have a proven track record of success, grit and a strong cultural fit. \n To give you some sense,  these 100-plus people contributed approximately 4% of annualized new business sold over the last year. So we're optimistic we can make this team upgrade without significantly impacting sales capacity. While team upgrades are always hard, this is a uniquely good time for us to do this. A year ago, the tech labor market was extremely tight. Today, there is an abundance of talent eager to work at Cloudflare. In Q1, we received more than 0.25 million applicants, approximately 40% of which were for sales positions. \n That's more applications than we received in all of 2021. In addition to the volume, the caliber of the applicants we're receiving is higher than we've seen at any point in our history, especially for go-to-market positions. While other companies are laying off, we're going to be bringing on great people with proven track records to raise the capability of our enterprise go-to-market team. \n We've always had a culture of high performance at Cloudflare. However, with the value of hindsight, I think we and most other businesses got a bit soft during the COVID crisis around performance management. That was understandable at the time, but that time is over. The work we do is vitally important for the healthy functioning of the Internet. The opportunity ahead of us is massive. We have amazing people on our team who are executing every day to realize that opportunity, and we have an incredibly long line of other proven talented people looking to step in to fill the position where some of our current team aren't living up to expectations. \n Our pace of innovation is not slowing down. Now more than ever, it's paramount we continue to innovate and develop unique offerings that deliver value to our customers and differentiate us from the competition. We are great at that. I want every dollar we put into Cloudflare to be more productive at driving revenue, profit and shareholder value. Innovation is a long-term competitive advantage, but productivity is too. Taking action to address inefficiencies in our go-to-market organization now will enable us to better capture new opportunities and expand our customer base and do so even more productively, profitably and predictably than before. \n While I've talked about our team that's underperforming, that's only half the story. Our top salespeople are terrific. On average, the top 15% of our sellers have achieved 129% of quota over the last 4 quarters. They're incredibly consistent at bringing in new logos, expanding current customers and delivering results and approximately 27% of them started within the last 18 months. We know that if we hire the right people, they can ramp quickly and be successful with a full bag of products we handle. \n In that spirit, let me tell you about some of the deals our top performers closed this quarter. A Fortune 500 media company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a 3-year $840,000 deal and bringing their total annual spend to $2.1 million. A customer of our application performance and security services since 2017, this company expanded into our Zero Trust portfolio with access and browser isolation for thousands of its contractors, displacing 2 Zero Trust competitors and even turning down 3 licenses from one of them. Cloudflare's products not only performed better than the competition during evaluation but we were the only company that could deliver on the complex requirements needed. This contract is only the tip of the iceberg with the customer, which plans to potentially roll Zero Trust out to all their tens of thousands of employees. \n Responding to our descaler campaign, a leading e-commerce technology company in Europe expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a 3-year $780,000 deal. The company is going all in on Cloudflare One, Gateway, Access, CASB, DLP and Magic WAN. They were drawn to Cloudflare's platform as a unified pane of glass to consolidate their security modernization and network transformation needs, with Magic WAN as a key competitive differentiator versus first-generation Zero Trust competitors. \n A global industrial machinery manufacturer expanded their relationship with us by signing a 3-year $648,000 deal.  The company was looking to modernize their security infrastructure and is also going all in on Cloudflare One with Access, Gateway, Area 1 and Magic WAN, displacing multiple competitors. They appreciate being able to consolidate vendors, reduce costs and increase flexibility with Cloudflare's platform. \n A Fortune 1000 SaaS company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a 3-year $8.4 million deal. The company recognized Cloudflare's unique position as a neutral super cloud to manage and strengthen their application security posture and accelerated SaaS platform performance across AWS, GCP and their private data center environment. Additionally, no other solution could compete with our data localization suite to simplify the customer's global regulatory and compliance requirements. A leading IoT security company expanded their relationship with us, signing 2 3-year deals for a combined $4.2 million, one for its commercial business and a FedRAMP one for its government business. \n The company has been a Cloudflare customer since 2020 using core application services and Cloudflare Tunnel for IoT devices. Drawn to our pace of innovation, this customer bought into the Cloudflare platform vision, now using over 25 products across core application services, Zero Trust and our developer platform, including R2, our object store and durable objects, combat high egress fees from AWS. They plan to use Cloudflare's FedRAMP authorization to scale operations on both commercial and federal sides of their business and increase their security posture. \n A Fortune 1000 retailer signed a $1.3 million 46-month contract for Cloudflare's core application services to displace their existing vendor. They also added R2. The company has been dissatisfied with the unpredictability of their bills and bot-related issues from the current vendor and wanted to switch to Cloudflare, knowing our universal approach to protecting all traffic and our platform ease of use were top of the industry. \n A leading gaming company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, moving from a pay-as-you-go customer spending $200 a month to a contracted customer signing a 1-year $388,000 deal for R2, Workers and application services. The company was looking for a more scalable platform for storage and outperformance that would support their exponential growth. The customer realized that by moving to R2, they could eliminate egress fees they were incurring from the competitor, easily integrate with S3 APIs and centralized management. In particular, they were impressed with R2's lower latency and better throughput as well as how R2 tightly integrates with Workers and our core application services. \n Traction among developers continues to be strong. We now have 4.92 million Workers applications running on our platform, up 146% over the last 6 months. 33,000 paying customers have activated R2 and are storing more than 7 petabytes of data, up 25% quarter-over-quarter. AI companies, large and small, continue to build on Cloudflare at a breakneck pace. When we ask them why, they cite our neutral position, rapid innovation and modern, nimble development environment. One last month called us \"The first cloud infrastructure company built for the age of AI.\" I like the ring of that. \n And I'm extremely excited about our upcoming announcement at Developer Week next month. We'll announce a lot around how we support AI and make any developer more productive. We are the best in the industry at innovation and we're making the changes we need to make and investing in our team to be the best in the industry of sales, too. \n As I step back and think about what was a challenging quarter, I'm struck by our opportunity. We are not limited by the market for our products. We are not limited by innovation. We are not limited by pipeline opportunity. We are not limited by our ability to recruit. And we are not even limited by sales capacity. Instead, we are limited by our go-to-market performance. That's something we can fix, and we are committed to turning the current macroeconomic headwinds into a catalyst for positive change in growth at Cloudflare by investing in our top talent, refocusing on performance management and elevating the productivity of our team to seize the opportunity we have ahead, which we all know is massive. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas to walk through the financials. Thomas, take it away. \nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. In the first quarter, we continue to witness a challenging business environment, which deteriorated significantly in March when negative headlines emerged related to SVB, the broadening banking crisis and the worsening macroeconomic outlook. With intensifying business uncertainty, companies became increasingly cautious in more deeply scrutinized field, which impacted numerous areas of our business, including a material lengthening of sales cycles, delays in collections and the significant back-end weighting in the linearity for the quarter. \n For some further context, technology, e-commerce and financial services our largest end customer verticals by revenue. Also, these headwinds to revenue growth that impacted Cloudflare outside of our control, we remain committed to controlling what we can control, and that is to focus on building great products that customers need while also maintaining our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and remaining good stewards of investors' capital. As such, we delivered a record quarter in terms of operating profit and operating margin and significantly outperformed on free cash flow. We also continue to prudently allocate capital with a focus on maximizing shareholder value. \n Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter increased 37% year-over-year to $290.2 million. New pipeline growth again remained strong in the first quarter, exceeding our internal plan for the second consecutive quarter in continuing the trend of accelerating growth in new pipeline generation for a third consecutive quarter. However, the significant incremental caution exhibited by customers resulted in a pronounced decline in our close rate and an extreme back-end weighting of ACV bookings during the first quarter, both of which were primarily impacted by the aforementioned longer sales cycles. \n More specifically, our average sales cycle during the first quarter was 27% longer than the average of the previous 4 quarters. Sales cycles increased most significantly in expansion deals with our contracted customers, which were 49% longer than the average of the previous 4 quarters. However, our win rates against the competition remain high. \n From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 37% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 40% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 31% year-over-year. \n Turning to our customer metrics. In the first quarter, we had 168,159 paying customers, representing an increase of 13% year-over-year. Turning to large customers. We ended the quarter with 2,156 large customers, representing an increase of 40% year-over-year and an addition of 114 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 117% during the first quarter, representing a decrease of 500 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 10 percentage points year-over-year. \n We've not experienced elevated churn rate as renewal rates in the first quarter were consistent with the levels experienced on average over the previous 4 quarters, which was an all-time high for the company. Instead,  similar to the fourth quarter of last year, the decline in D&R was again primarily driven by delayed expansion with our larger customers. \n Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 77.8%, representing an increase of 40 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 90 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 5% of revenue in the first quarter. For fiscal 2023, we continue to expect network CapEx to be 11% to 13% of revenue. \n Turning to operating expenses. We understand that a crucial aspect of our success is our commitment to being responsive to near-term changes in market conditions and adjusting our operations accordingly without compromising the long-term opportunity ahead of us, which we all know is massive. We again took proactive measures during the first quarter to improve operational efficiency and effectively manage spending. \n As a result of these actions, first quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased 5% year-over-year to 71%. Our total number of employees increased 23% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to approximately 3,390 at the end of the quarter. We will continue to pace hiring for the year based on market conditions. \n Sales and marketing expenses were $120.6 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased by 1% sequentially and remained consistent at 42% compared to the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $51.3 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased to 18% from 19% in the same quarter last year. \n General and administrative expenses were $34.6 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased to 12% from 15% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $19.4 million compared to an operating income of $4.9 million in the same period last year. First quarter operating margin was 6.7%, an increase of 440 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight the efficiency and elasticity of our business model, which remain key elements of Cloudflare success. \n Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $27.2 million or a diluted net income per share of $0.08. During the first quarter, we initiated a tax planning strategies, and we were able to successfully reduce cash taxes related to [indiscernible] and other taxes. As a result, tax expense for the quarter was $3.9 million. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was $13.9 million for the first quarter or 5% of revenue compared to negative $64.4 million or 30% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in $959 million, representing an increase of 6% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. \n Before moving to guidance for the second quarter and full year, I would like to begin with our expectations and the provisions we have factored into guidance. Last quarter, we highlighted our expectation for sales cycles to continue to lengthen for both the first quarter and full year 2023. However, the level of elongation experienced in the first quarter was unprecedented and far surpassed our forecast entering the year, pressuring revenue growth. As a result, for the second quarter, despite the continued reacceleration of our new pipeline generation and our high win rate against the competition, we've assumed sales cycles to remain at the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter and have, therefore, also assumed close rates remain at continued low levels. \n From a linearity perspective, we have assumed a continued back-end weighting of ACV booked and have, therefore, incorporated minimal in-period revenue recognition for the second quarter. Also, we believe that currently depressed close rates and elongated sale cycles are temporary in nature, we cannot predict when the increasing caution is exhibited by the customers during the first quarter will recover. As such, we have assumed these headwinds, which identified in the month of March will persist through the end of the fiscal year. \n Now turning to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $305 million to $306 million, representing an increase of 30% year-over-year. [Audio Gap] operating income in the range of $14 million to $15 million, and we expect diluted net income per share of $0.07 to $0.08, assuming approximately 345 million common shares outstanding.  Due to our aforementioned tax planning strategies, we expect an effective tax rate of 6%. \n For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.284 billion, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $73 million to $77 million, and we expect diluted net income per share over that period in the range of $0.34 to $0.35 assuming approximately 345 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 9% for 2023. \n After having achieved positive free cash flow in the second half of last year and again during the first quarter of this year, we continue to anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2023. For modeling purposes, we expect free cash flow to trend upward on an ongoing basis but anticipate near-term variability in our free cash flow generation with the second quarter anticipated to be lower than the first quarter due to the timing of capital expenditures and other payables. \n In closing, we remain confident in the enormous opportunity ahead of us as well as the elasticity and durability of our operating model. We are focused on becoming even more efficient and more productive, not just during the currently challenging macroeconomic backdrop, but also because operational efficiency is a long-term competitive advantage. I'd also like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers and partners. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\n We'll go first this afternoon to Sterling Auty of MoffettNathanson. . \nPeter Sterling Auty: I think the big question is around the guidance. I think coming out of last quarter, the perception was that the guidance was actually aggressive and you kind of alluded to the close rates that you had factored in. Now with the changes that you've seen and especially in light of the sales changes you're looking to make, what are the elements that investors can look to see the confidence in being able to deliver on the revised outlook? \nThomas Seifert: Yes. Maybe I get started here. Remember, when we gave guidance during the last quarter, we actually said -- the first and second quarters are more challenging than the later half of the year. We looked at close rates and assumed that what we had seen in the third and fourth quarter of last year, a elongation would continue. But the deteriorating environment surprised us. We saw sales cycles really elongate far beyond our forecast up to 27% on average and then the expansion business, as I said before, close to 50%. So those were material differences in the assumptions we had at the beginning of this year. \n I think we took this into account and adjusted guidance now carefully also assuming that the linearity deterioration we've seen in the first quarter would continue for the second quarter. Specifically, we have assumed hardly any revenue recognition from in-quarter ACV generation. So this, I think, is prudent in light of what we have seen. You heard from Matthew that the salespeople that are impacted by this measure contributed very little in terms of our overall ACV generation to the current results. So we think there is more upside in this transition than there is downside in terms of performance and positive impact on sales capacity moving forward. \n The good thing to point out, however, is again, that the improvement in pipeline that we have now seen over consecutive quarters has continued in the first quarter. So as Matthew mentioned, it's not a limitation of opportunity, we will see in sales cycles extend but not pipeline slowing down. So on that was a very encouraging time. But I think the results are prudently now reflected in the guidance and the deterioration we've seen in the first quarter, especially from a sales cycle perspective, had material impact on how we think about the rest of the year. . \nPeter Sterling Auty: Understood. And maybe one quick follow-up for Matthew. Can you just characterize for us the traction in the AI opportunity in particular to give us one example. But when you look at it as a whole, how are you seeing it track? And what should we think about the expansion opportunities from that customer base through the rest of the year? \nMatthew Prince: Yes, Sterling. The AI is something that I think surprised us last quarter in terms of the positive impact when it continues to surprise us. We've seen the revenue that's coming from AI companies just quarter-over-quarter have substantial growth north of 20% quarter-over-quarter growth from the large AI companies that use us. And it's not just 1 or 2, but from large to small. What we're hearing from AI companies is that as they look to who they're going to use for their infrastructure and they can start with a clean slate, that Cloudflare is a part of that and that we're helping them go fast, compete, get the most efficiency, be able to protect themselves from some of the significant cybersecurity and fraud risks that they face. .\n And that continues to be something that is delivering really positive results for us. I think you're going to see us during our developer week next month in May, highlight some of these customer stories and highlight ways that AI companies are using Cloudflare in order to push that innovation forward. So I think that, that has continued to be a real positive for us, and that has only accelerated from even Q4. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n We'll go next now to Thomas Blakey of KeyBanc. \nThomas Blakey: Tom Blakey here, KeyBanc. It sounds like there's a lot of pent-up demand, no gross churn and pipeline making new records. Maybe it's for Matthew. You talk about it -- these are critical needs in terms of access and security but not so much a nice to have. What are these customers explaining to you that there waiting on maybe looking for sort of some indicators in terms of like how long this pause will kind of take to thaw out Matthew? That would be my first question. \nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that everyone continues to communicate to us that they are -- that they want to continue to invest with us. I think what we're seeing from IT organizations is that they're all looking very critically at their budgets and asking themselves what projects can they delay versus what projects do they have to invest in. So we continue to see when companies are under duress, when they're under attack, that those deals are closing extremely quickly. But some of the times where people are initiating a new large project around moving to a Zero Trust environment or something else that would be a larger initiative that the sales cycles on those projects are extending beyond where they were before. \n I think one of the things that's unique about Cloudflare is even with the extended sales cycles, our sales cycles tend to, on average, be significantly faster than the peers in our industry. And so back in early 2022, we were among the first to call the slowdown in the economy because we could see the sales cycles slow down. That -- they picked back up, but then again, are slowing down right now. I think we tend to see that earlier than some of our peers. And I think that one of the things that has always characterized how we think about our business is real prudence as we look forward. So no one is telling us that projects are getting canceled in any significant way. \n But people are saying budgets are tight, we're being more cautious, and that is taking our sales cycles to be longer than we have historically seen and longer even than the elevation that we saw through the back half of 2022. So we're trying to be very prudent about how we think about this. But customers continue to tell us they're not switching to another competitor. They're not -- we haven't seen any elevation in loss rates to the competition. Quite the opposite. People are saying we want to invest with you, we're just being cautious with our IT spend, and that's causing everyone to measure twice before they cut once. \nThomas Blakey: All right. That's helpful, Matthew. And maybe as a follow-up, a perfect segue actually to the conservativeness of this guide. It sounds like it's increasingly conservative. I'd love to hear, maybe from Thomas, in terms of maybe any indications of what he's seeing from numbers coming in, in April. It's been a month from the end of March, and just kind of trying to gauge in terms of when we could even get back to this 130% long-term governor would be helpful, Thomas. \nThomas Seifert: We -- there -- the early indication on the second quarter do not indicate a material change neither to the negative, nor to the positive. So we are cruising along. But no indication that it gets materially better. But as I said, no indications that it's deteriorating either. \nOperator: We go next now to Brent Thill at Jefferies. \nBrent Thill: Matthew, just on the sales side, when you think about what's happening with the new head of revenue and ultimately kind of the -- what happens when you change out -- I mean, I guess, how confident are you that there isn't a longer transition on the existing team? What's giving you that view that this current team is kind of in place, you've got the right fit, and this is maybe more internal execution than external forces? \nMatthew Prince: Well, I think it's a combination of both of those things, if we're honest. I think that the fact that the macro economy has gotten harder exposed some of the weaknesses in some of the sellers on our team. When things were cruising along in 2021, again, you didn't have to be a really disciplined seller in order to be successful at Cloudflare. And I think that, that, combined with some of the -- what happened during COVID, combined with our hesitancy in terms of what the opportunity costs were in terms of replacing people when  the tech employment market was overheating, all combined to have us get to a place where we just had a number of people on our team who weren't performing. \n And I think Marc has done an incredible job at really identifying specifically who those people are and starting the process of moving those people off. What I see, though, is that if you look at our top sellers, they are enjoying incredible success and where the lowest performing sellers decelerated substantially during the macroeconomic slowdown, the top sellers on our team have seen around a 1% decrease in their productivity. And so what that indicates to me is that with new leaders like Marc who are on board and some of the lieutenants that he is bringing on and the incredible talent which is applying to Cloudflare. Again, 0.25 million people applied to work for us in Q1. I don't know of any other SaaS company that is seeing that volume of talent that is out there. \n People want to come work for us. The people who are successful at Cloudflare can be extremely productive and can do well themselves as sellers. And I think Marc is bringing in a focus and a discipline which is going to pay off. And the thing that's, I think, very encouraging is, as we look at the people that we can replace that -- that they are contributing such a small percentage in terms of our capacity that we actually think that this will -- any type of change like this obviously has -- is something that we want to do very humanely and we want to be very thoughtful about taking care of the team that we have. \n But we think that as we transition that team out we're going to not only increase the performance of our high performers but bring on new performers that give us much higher performing capacity, and Marc, I think is doing an incredible job at not only identifying who has to be moved out. But boy, when I talk to the people that we're hiring to replace those people, I just get incredibly excited by what they are able to deliver to us. \nBrent Thill: And just a quick follow-up for Thomas. It looks like, if I'm looking at this right, the number of net new enterprise accounts was the lowest you've seen in 2 years at 114 sequentially. So I guess it seems like you saw it across both enterprise and SMB is kind of the way to frame it, that even -- there wasn't one sector that stayed stronger. \nThomas Seifert: I think that read is correct. \nOperator: We go next now to Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. \nMatthew Hedberg: Maybe a follow-up to that last question from Brent. A comment on the pay-as-you-go side of your business. Is that being impacted by macro sort of more or less the same as the enterprise? . \nMatthew Prince: I think that what we're seeing is, again, weakness across the entire space. Pay as you go, remember, is a relatively small percentage of our overall business, less than 15% of revenue. So it doesn't move the needle one direction or another. But we definitely are seeing that there is a lower rate of upgrade. But at the same time, we are not seeing that there is a lower rate of downgrade. What I am excited by is the developer traction that we're seeing across our business. \n The fact that we're closing in on 5 million applications running across the platform. That -- the majority of those are coming from pay-as-you-go developers. And that continues to be a pipeline where we see lots of success. We also have examples like the one that cited in the prepared remarks, where we had a customer that was paying us $200 a month that we identify, worked with and were able to upgrade to an enterprise customer spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year with us. \n So pay-as-you-go continues to pay lots of dividends. But I think that the same conservativeness where people are just watching their budgets much more carefully shows up across the entire space. And that -- and we don't see a significant difference at the low end of our business versus the high end of the business. \nMatthew Hedberg: Got it. And then, Thomas, with the reduced '23 outlook, 31.5%, I think in the midpoint, that's below sort of the implied 5-year, $5 billion target that you guys talked about a couple of quarters ago. Just any thoughts on -- does this environment change your thought process on getting to that $5 billion in 5 years? Or maybe just some updated thoughts on that? \nThomas Seifert: As Matthew rightfully pointed out, the market is not limiting. It's limiting us and the opportunity is not limiting us. There are some headwinds now. They will be temporary in nature, but they don't take away from the enormous opportunity that is in front of us. So it doesn't change our thinking around where this journey is going to take us. \nOperator: We go next now to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. \nKeith Weiss: I think I'm a little dense here. I'm not quite getting what happened in the quarter. When I think through like some of the explanations that you guys are giving, the banking crisis was in the first 2 weeks of March. You guys tend to have a pretty linear business. So like I would have expected the comment to be we only closed like 15% of our business in the last 2 weeks, if that was what the impact was. And then like with the salespeople, if they hadn't been productive for a while, there's nothing really incremental there. \n And you guys have been -- and Matthew, you called out a weaker macro last year, and you were one of the earlier ones to say, hey, listen, it is an [indiscernible]  environment out there, but you guys were able to operate really effectively all throughout 2022, and you bring to market a really good ROI focus and a really good cost like value proposition, like I don't quite get what changed in Q1 in the timeframe in which it changed? \nMatthew Prince: Keith, I think that as we've put a floodlight on it, the biggest thing that changed is sales cycle length, more than 25%. And so that pushed back a lot of what was happening in the quarter. We would typically see about half of our business close in the last month of the quarter. I think the fact that you had the uncertainty around the bank. And again, it wasn't just customers of SVB or Credit Suisse, but it was entire spaces where purchasing departments really said -- I mean they got very nervous regardless of who they were banking with. \n And we just saw more companies push pause on that. That pushed a lot of our business into the last half of March and it pushed some of our business outside of the -- of closing within the quarter. And so what we don't know is whether March is the new reality, in which case, again, I think we want to be very prudent as how we think about the business going forward or if the world will snap back fairly quickly. \n The early reads that we're seeing are not that we're -- again, it doesn't feel like it's getting significantly worse, but we don't also see things getting significantly better. But that, again, as we've sort of shone a floodlight on what was it that changed -- what changed is a material change in the length of the sales cycles, the win rates didn't change, but the close rates did. \nKeith Weiss: Got it. It was -- you guys mentioned that you saw that in both small customers and large customers. Were there any product families that sustained better or worse than others? Was there any variance on that side of the equation? \nMatthew Prince: I think we continue to have extremely fast close rate when someone is under duress. So when they see that there is a problem and they need -- and they need to address it. I think -- and that doesn't change quarter-over-quarter for, I think, obvious reasons. We are able to respond very quickly, and someone's offline, we bring them back online. And those deals close often a matter of hours. The things that -- other things that showed a lot of promise in the quarter were things like R2, where we're increasingly seeing large customers bring over larger and larger data sets. \n But across the board, we were saying that anything that requires sort of a larger IT commitment, customers were again measuring twice before they cut once, and there was a material increase in sales cycles. What I think is different about us and a lot of other companies is that we see things faster because even with the 25% increase in sales cycles, we're still significantly faster sales cycles than most other SaaS companies. And so I think we see things earlier, and what we don't know again is that they a radical change to how procurement departments are thinking about IT spending. \n That is what we are trying to be prudent around when we think about guidance. Or is it something that was just a short-term effect of sort of the anxiety in March around the banking sector? And I think that this quarter -- this next quarter will prove out which direction that goes. But we want to be extremely prudent and cautious as we think about things going forward. \nOperator: We go next now to James Fish at Piper Sandler. \nJames Fish: On gross margins you are holding above your long-term average as well. And Matthew, you actually just talked about the fact that these larger commitments are taking longer. Is there a thought process here to maybe just try to get that and land a little bit smaller and maybe offer higher discounts kind of near term to try to land smaller deals here? \nMatthew Prince: I think we're -- I think that's always been part of our playbook. And I think that what we are able to do because of the broad set of products that we have is find lots of different ways into a customer's account. And so that is, I think, a -- that's something that we're able to do, and I think we can maintain gross margins that are within our 75% to 77% target range. I think it's a mistake for us to dramatically take that gross margin rate down over time. But I think that we can actually bundle and discount and go after even small deals because of the margin profile that we have and then use the engineering that we have in order to deliver still the gross margins that we expect. \n So we're not changing what our gross margin targets are. We are not losing deals on price. And we've been able to continue to be extremely competitive and deliver an extremely high ROI while also delivering software gross margins. \nJames Fish: Makes sense. And Thomas, I appreciate all the details around sales cycles lengthening. But on the close rates, is there a way to think about the magnitude difference you're seeing here? And how much worse could it get for you guys? Is this kind of the bottom potentially of close rates that you're assuming? Or could it get another step lower from here? \nThomas Seifert: We always say we are prudent about when we talk about our guidance. I think we try to be prudent for this quarter. We tried to take into account what we have seen in the first quarter. And we're thoughtful around how we build improvement or non-improvement in those variables. So we -- the nonlinearity we saw in the quarter was significant. We have not incorporated any significant improvement. As I said in the second quarter, we have not assumed any significant revenue recognition from ACV during the second quarter. \n So I think we have been a lot of thoughtful about how we looked at the outlook. I just want to reiterate what Matthew said. When we started this year, we start to talk from our perspective. At that point, we set the guidance for the first quarter, especially is probably more challenging than for the remainder of the year. That's how thing -- I think how we framed it. If you look at the first quarter, we came into a range of our guidance slightly off the midpoint in -- primarily because of the nonlinearity of the first quarter. \n What impacted the forward-looking guidance is that elongation of sales cycles. And that is -- so you push a wave of ACV further out. And we looked at that wave, and we have not assumed that it's going to pull in significantly over the course of the year. So I thought we have been thoughtful about how we put the guidance together. \nOperator: We go next now to Joel Fishbein at Truist. \nJoel Fishbein: Matthew, just one for you and really appreciate the color on the change you're making a go-to-market efficiency, but I wanted to ask about some of the partnerships that you've established with some of the global SIs like Accenture and Shields Up and to see if you've seen any change in that go-to-market? And maybe just give us an update on how those are factoring. \nMatthew Prince: I think that we're still in the early days of that, but encouraging. We were able to win a federal deal, which continues to expand in partnership with Accenture. And that has given them confidence to take us to market in a number of other partnership and global deals. I think that Marc has been great in terms of bringing real focus on partnerships and thinking about what are the parts of the market that we want to serve directly versus what are the parts of the market that we want to serve with partners. And I think as we have these early wins, that begets our ability to win more with the large global systems integrators and other large partners. \n They're seeing the same thing that we are. When we talk -- when I talk to them, they're seeing very much a conservatism around IT spend. That, I think, is less pronounced in the security space. And so I think that there is more willingness and eagerness to work with us. But when we talk to the systems integrators and other large partners, especially at the high end of the market, I think that they are reflecting the same sort of conservatism of measure multiple times before you cut that they're seeing from their customers. \n And I think that it continues to be a large opportunity and something that, especially in Zero Trust and Workers we're seeing that we can deliver more with them. But I think that, that is a place where we've actually seen IT shops look at ways of making sure that they're being as optimal as possible. \nJoel Fishbein: Just as a quick follow-up. Are the deal sizes they are generally bigger than your normal size since you're landing it seems like to be larger organizations with these partners? \nMatthew Prince: Yes. They tend to be larger than the average deal. But we land $10 million-plus deals on our own as well. I think over time, you'll see us, again, work more closely with those SIs and other partners to deliver some of the larger deals and make sure that we can make inroads into more accounts and use them as a way to help integrate larger solutions together. So again, I think it's something that is a priority for us. I think we have the early wins, but now we need to continue to scale those programs. \nOperator: We'll take our final question today from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. \nMark Murphy: Thomas, were bookings more heavily impacted on the CDN side of the business or the security side or perhaps elsewhere? \nThomas Seifert: We never talk about CDN. I would say, I come back to what Matthew said. If customers are in difficult situations under duress, we onboard fast. Those products tend to be security products. And so if there's a statement at all, product-wise is that security product suites are doing better than the application services. \nMark Murphy: Okay. Understood. And then, Matthew, when you look back on it, and I think Brent asked about this a bit earlier, but the change in Head of Sales position last November, the goal was to introduce more rigor and discipline. I think you acknowledged at the time that those changes can take time. I'm curious to what extent you might have actually seen disruptions from sales org changes, whether it be account mapping or territory assignments or commission structures or anything along those lines, which you could look at and say, well, this might actually stabilize a little later in the year. \nMatthew Prince: Yes. I understand that, that would be handy if we could point to that. I don't think that that's what we're seeing right now. I think that we have actually seen our top sellers be more productive. I think that the changes that Marc is putting in place really are starting with these changes now. And that obviously does introduce uncertainties. We think we have our handle around that. I think we've planned that extremely well. \n And again, I think that as we look out at the caliber and quality of the people who we can bring on board and how we can invest in our top performers today, just getting our sales performance to look much more like a normal distribution than what today is much more of a bimodal distribution is an extremely effective way for us to reaccelerate the growth that we have. And so the changes that Marc is making are the right changes. Our team, the highest performing individual contributors and managers on our team are leaning forward and e-mailing me every day about how great it is to have an additional amount of rigor and discipline. \n There may be bumps along the road. These transitions do take time. But I think we are on the right path. Marc is the right person. Across our team the feedback that we're getting is extremely positive. And again, we're not limited by the market for our products. We're not limited by innovation. We're not limited by pipeline. We're not even limited really by sales capacity even as we transition people off of our team. \n And so that gives me a lot of confidence going forward that while we will continue to see pressure from the macroeconomic conditions over the next year, I am -- I really am excited for as we have our sales engine match our innovation engine, what we're going to be able to deliver as a company. \nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for your questions this afternoon. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Prince for any closing comments. \nMatthew Prince: Thank you so much. Really appreciate everybody tuning in for the call. This has definitely been a quarter of contrast but it is an incredible opportunity for us to continue to make Cloudflare a better company. \n I appreciate all of the hard work from all of our team. We are excited for the quarter ahead. I hope to see many of you at our Investor Day on May 4, and make sure to tune in the following week for Developer Week. There are a number of incredible announcements coming. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Prince. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Cloudflare Q1 2023 earnings call. Again, we'd like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great evening. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. In the first quarter, we continue to witness a challenging business environment, which deteriorated significantly in March when negative headlines emerged related to SVB, the broadening banking crisis and the worsening macroeconomic outlook. With intensifying business uncertainty, companies became increasingly cautious in more deeply scrutinized field, which impacted numerous areas of our business, including a material lengthening of sales cycles, delays in collections and the significant back-end weighting in the linearity for the quarter. \n For some further context, technology, e-commerce and financial services our largest end customer verticals by revenue. Also, these headwinds to revenue growth that impacted Cloudflare outside of our control, we remain committed to controlling what we can control, and that is to focus on building great products that customers need while also maintaining our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and remaining good stewards of investors' capital. As such, we delivered a record quarter in terms of operating profit and operating margin and significantly outperformed on free cash flow. We also continue to prudently allocate capital with a focus on maximizing shareholder value. \n Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter increased 37% year-over-year to $290.2 million. New pipeline growth again remained strong in the first quarter, exceeding our internal plan for the second consecutive quarter in continuing the trend of accelerating growth in new pipeline generation for a third consecutive quarter. However, the significant incremental caution exhibited by customers resulted in a pronounced decline in our close rate and an extreme back-end weighting of ACV bookings during the first quarter, both of which were primarily impacted by the aforementioned longer sales cycles. \n More specifically, our average sales cycle during the first quarter was 27% longer than the average of the previous 4 quarters. Sales cycles increased most significantly in expansion deals with our contracted customers, which were 49% longer than the average of the previous 4 quarters. However, our win rates against the competition remain high. \n From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 53% of revenue and increased 37% year-over-year. EMEA represented 27% of revenue and increased 40% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 31% year-over-year. \n Turning to our customer metrics. In the first quarter, we had 168,159 paying customers, representing an increase of 13% year-over-year. Turning to large customers. We ended the quarter with 2,156 large customers, representing an increase of 40% year-over-year and an addition of 114 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 117% during the first quarter, representing a decrease of 500 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 10 percentage points year-over-year. \n We've not experienced elevated churn rate as renewal rates in the first quarter were consistent with the levels experienced on average over the previous 4 quarters, which was an all-time high for the company. Instead,  similar to the fourth quarter of last year, the decline in D&R was again primarily driven by delayed expansion with our larger customers. \n Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 77.8%, representing an increase of 40 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 90 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 5% of revenue in the first quarter. For fiscal 2023, we continue to expect network CapEx to be 11% to 13% of revenue. \n Turning to operating expenses. We understand that a crucial aspect of our success is our commitment to being responsive to near-term changes in market conditions and adjusting our operations accordingly without compromising the long-term opportunity ahead of us, which we all know is massive. We again took proactive measures during the first quarter to improve operational efficiency and effectively manage spending. \n As a result of these actions, first quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased 5% year-over-year to 71%. Our total number of employees increased 23% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to approximately 3,390 at the end of the quarter. We will continue to pace hiring for the year based on market conditions. \n Sales and marketing expenses were $120.6 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue increased by 1% sequentially and remained consistent at 42% compared to the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $51.3 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased to 18% from 19% in the same quarter last year. \n General and administrative expenses were $34.6 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue remained consistent sequentially and decreased to 12% from 15% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $19.4 million compared to an operating income of $4.9 million in the same period last year. First quarter operating margin was 6.7%, an increase of 440 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight the efficiency and elasticity of our business model, which remain key elements of Cloudflare success. \n Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $27.2 million or a diluted net income per share of $0.08. During the first quarter, we initiated a tax planning strategies, and we were able to successfully reduce cash taxes related to [indiscernible] and other taxes. As a result, tax expense for the quarter was $3.9 million. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities. Free cash flow was $13.9 million for the first quarter or 5% of revenue compared to negative $64.4 million or 30% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in $959 million, representing an increase of 6% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Current RPO was 75% of total RPO. \n Before moving to guidance for the second quarter and full year, I would like to begin with our expectations and the provisions we have factored into guidance. Last quarter, we highlighted our expectation for sales cycles to continue to lengthen for both the first quarter and full year 2023. However, the level of elongation experienced in the first quarter was unprecedented and far surpassed our forecast entering the year, pressuring revenue growth. As a result, for the second quarter, despite the continued reacceleration of our new pipeline generation and our high win rate against the competition, we've assumed sales cycles to remain at the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter and have, therefore, also assumed close rates remain at continued low levels. \n From a linearity perspective, we have assumed a continued back-end weighting of ACV booked and have, therefore, incorporated minimal in-period revenue recognition for the second quarter. Also, we believe that currently depressed close rates and elongated sale cycles are temporary in nature, we cannot predict when the increasing caution is exhibited by the customers during the first quarter will recover. As such, we have assumed these headwinds, which identified in the month of March will persist through the end of the fiscal year. \n Now turning to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $305 million to $306 million, representing an increase of 30% year-over-year. [Audio Gap] operating income in the range of $14 million to $15 million, and we expect diluted net income per share of $0.07 to $0.08, assuming approximately 345 million common shares outstanding.  Due to our aforementioned tax planning strategies, we expect an effective tax rate of 6%. \n For the full year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.284 billion, representing an increase of 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $73 million to $77 million, and we expect diluted net income per share over that period in the range of $0.34 to $0.35 assuming approximately 345 million common shares outstanding. We expect an effective tax rate of 9% for 2023. \n After having achieved positive free cash flow in the second half of last year and again during the first quarter of this year, we continue to anticipate being free cash flow positive for the full year 2023. For modeling purposes, we expect free cash flow to trend upward on an ongoing basis but anticipate near-term variability in our free cash flow generation with the second quarter anticipated to be lower than the first quarter due to the timing of capital expenditures and other payables. \n In closing, we remain confident in the enormous opportunity ahead of us as well as the elasticity and durability of our operating model. We are focused on becoming even more efficient and more productive, not just during the currently challenging macroeconomic backdrop, but also because operational efficiency is a long-term competitive advantage. I'd also like to thank our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers and partners. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Yes. Maybe I get started here. Remember, when we gave guidance during the last quarter, we actually said -- the first and second quarters are more challenging than the later half of the year. We looked at close rates and assumed that what we had seen in the third and fourth quarter of last year, a elongation would continue. But the deteriorating environment surprised us. We saw sales cycles really elongate far beyond our forecast up to 27% on average and then the expansion business, as I said before, close to 50%. So those were material differences in the assumptions we had at the beginning of this year. \n I think we took this into account and adjusted guidance now carefully also assuming that the linearity deterioration we've seen in the first quarter would continue for the second quarter. Specifically, we have assumed hardly any revenue recognition from in-quarter ACV generation. So this, I think, is prudent in light of what we have seen. You heard from Matthew that the salespeople that are impacted by this measure contributed very little in terms of our overall ACV generation to the current results. So we think there is more upside in this transition than there is downside in terms of performance and positive impact on sales capacity moving forward. \n The good thing to point out, however, is again, that the improvement in pipeline that we have now seen over consecutive quarters has continued in the first quarter. So as Matthew mentioned, it's not a limitation of opportunity, we will see in sales cycles extend but not pipeline slowing down. So on that was a very encouraging time. But I think the results are prudently now reflected in the guidance and the deterioration we've seen in the first quarter, especially from a sales cycle perspective, had material impact on how we think about the rest of the year. . We -- there -- the early indication on the second quarter do not indicate a material change neither to the negative, nor to the positive. So we are cruising along. But no indication that it gets materially better. But as I said, no indications that it's deteriorating either. I think that read is correct. As Matthew rightfully pointed out, the market is not limiting. It's limiting us and the opportunity is not limiting us. There are some headwinds now. They will be temporary in nature, but they don't take away from the enormous opportunity that is in front of us. So it doesn't change our thinking around where this journey is going to take us. We always say we are prudent about when we talk about our guidance. I think we try to be prudent for this quarter. We tried to take into account what we have seen in the first quarter. And we're thoughtful around how we build improvement or non-improvement in those variables. So we -- the nonlinearity we saw in the quarter was significant. We have not incorporated any significant improvement. As I said in the second quarter, we have not assumed any significant revenue recognition from ACV during the second quarter. \n So I think we have been a lot of thoughtful about how we looked at the outlook. I just want to reiterate what Matthew said. When we started this year, we start to talk from our perspective. At that point, we set the guidance for the first quarter, especially is probably more challenging than for the remainder of the year. That's how thing -- I think how we framed it. If you look at the first quarter, we came into a range of our guidance slightly off the midpoint in -- primarily because of the nonlinearity of the first quarter. \n What impacted the forward-looking guidance is that elongation of sales cycles. And that is -- so you push a wave of ACV further out. And we looked at that wave, and we have not assumed that it's going to pull in significantly over the course of the year. So I thought we have been thoughtful about how we put the guidance together. We never talk about CDN. I would say, I come back to what Matthew said. If customers are in difficult situations under duress, we onboard fast. Those products tend to be security products. And so if there's a statement at all, product-wise is that security product suites are doing better than the application services."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Phil. Q1 was a quarter of contrast. We achieved revenue of $290.2 million, up 37% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 77.8%, again, above our long-term target range of 75% to 77% and up from 77.4% last quarter. During the quarter, we added 114 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 2,156 large customers, up 40% year-over-year. Our dollar-based net retention fell to 117%, down 5% quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, we did not see elevated churn across our broad customer base. Instead, we saw a slower expansion from existing customers. More on that in a second. \n Throughout this quarter of contrast, we saw tailwinds and headwinds. The reacceleration of our new business pipeline during the second half of 2022 continued again this quarter, and we meaningfully exceeded our pipeline plan for the second quarter in a row. Our win rate against the competition remained at record high levels, and renewal rates were consistent with the high levels experienced over the previous 4 quarters. Those were all positive signs. \n On the flip side, the quarter saw new challenges, macroeconomic uncertainty, which intensified over the course of Q1 with every failing bank resulted in a material lengthening of sales cycles, a significant decline in close rates, even as win rates held strong and an extreme back-end weighting to the quarter. To give you some sense, almost half of the new business closed in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, which is very nonlinear for us. All of these factors put pressure on growth. The quarter most reminded me of Q1 of 2020 when businesses were paralyzingly nervous about the impact of COVID-19. \n I think this parallel shows how with uncertainty in the economy, companies are closely watching their own businesses before committing to new spending. Thankfully, we continue to be a must-have, not a nice to have. And most of the deals we expected to close did, just later than we expected. I'm proud of our team's ability to sail through the rough seas that characterize Q1. \n Although the current economy poses uncertainty for nearly every business in the near term, as Mark Hawkins and our Board likes to say, when the going gets tough, the tough get profitable, and we are tough. We have our hands firmly on the tiller of our business and are able to adjust to rapidly evolving market conditions in order to deliver operating profit of $19.4 million, representing a record operating margin of 6.7%. Furthermore, in spite of tougher collections in the quarter, particularly in the month of March, we generated $13.9 million of free cash flow, representing a free cash flow margin of 5%. \n We continue to be on track to be free cash flow positive for 2023. As we navigate through the challenging macroeconomic seas facing our industry, this period of external uncertainty presents us with a perfect opportunity to be internally reflective, identifying areas of improvement within our business and taking proactive steps to create an even more successful and productive organization. As I take stock, we are not limited by the size of our market for our products, we are not limited by our ability to innovate, we are not limited by pipeline opportunity, and we are not limited by sales capacity. So what are we limited by? \n As I said last quarter, Marc Boroditsky, our new President of Revenue, has dug into retooling our go-to-market efforts and identified significant opportunities to improve the efficiency and performance of our sales teams. Although we've won 1/3 of the Fortune 500 customers, if we're honest with ourselves, we saw a lot of our success with our enterprise customers because our products were so good and solved real problems that every big company faces.  That allowed many on our sales team to succeed largely by just taking orders. When the fish are jumping right in the boat, you don't need to be a very good fishermen. \n But at the risk of mixing watering metaphors, as the tide goes out, you get a clear view who's not wearing shorts. The macroeconomic environment has gotten harder, and we're seeing that some on our team aren't dressed for work. Digging in with Marc, we've identified more than 100 people on our sales team who have consistently missed expectations. Simply put, a significant percentage of our sales force has been repeatedly underperforming based on measurable performance targets and critical KPIs. That's obviously a problem.  \n But it's won in this environment with a particularly available and actionable solution. We are now in the process of quickly rotating out those members of our team who have been underperforming and bringing in new talent with salespeople who have a proven track record of success, grit and a strong cultural fit. \n To give you some sense,  these 100-plus people contributed approximately 4% of annualized new business sold over the last year. So we're optimistic we can make this team upgrade without significantly impacting sales capacity. While team upgrades are always hard, this is a uniquely good time for us to do this. A year ago, the tech labor market was extremely tight. Today, there is an abundance of talent eager to work at Cloudflare. In Q1, we received more than 0.25 million applicants, approximately 40% of which were for sales positions. \n That's more applications than we received in all of 2021. In addition to the volume, the caliber of the applicants we're receiving is higher than we've seen at any point in our history, especially for go-to-market positions. While other companies are laying off, we're going to be bringing on great people with proven track records to raise the capability of our enterprise go-to-market team. \n We've always had a culture of high performance at Cloudflare. However, with the value of hindsight, I think we and most other businesses got a bit soft during the COVID crisis around performance management. That was understandable at the time, but that time is over. The work we do is vitally important for the healthy functioning of the Internet. The opportunity ahead of us is massive. We have amazing people on our team who are executing every day to realize that opportunity, and we have an incredibly long line of other proven talented people looking to step in to fill the position where some of our current team aren't living up to expectations. \n Our pace of innovation is not slowing down. Now more than ever, it's paramount we continue to innovate and develop unique offerings that deliver value to our customers and differentiate us from the competition. We are great at that. I want every dollar we put into Cloudflare to be more productive at driving revenue, profit and shareholder value. Innovation is a long-term competitive advantage, but productivity is too. Taking action to address inefficiencies in our go-to-market organization now will enable us to better capture new opportunities and expand our customer base and do so even more productively, profitably and predictably than before. \n While I've talked about our team that's underperforming, that's only half the story. Our top salespeople are terrific. On average, the top 15% of our sellers have achieved 129% of quota over the last 4 quarters. They're incredibly consistent at bringing in new logos, expanding current customers and delivering results and approximately 27% of them started within the last 18 months. We know that if we hire the right people, they can ramp quickly and be successful with a full bag of products we handle. \n In that spirit, let me tell you about some of the deals our top performers closed this quarter. A Fortune 500 media company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a 3-year $840,000 deal and bringing their total annual spend to $2.1 million. A customer of our application performance and security services since 2017, this company expanded into our Zero Trust portfolio with access and browser isolation for thousands of its contractors, displacing 2 Zero Trust competitors and even turning down 3 licenses from one of them. Cloudflare's products not only performed better than the competition during evaluation but we were the only company that could deliver on the complex requirements needed. This contract is only the tip of the iceberg with the customer, which plans to potentially roll Zero Trust out to all their tens of thousands of employees. \n Responding to our descaler campaign, a leading e-commerce technology company in Europe expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a 3-year $780,000 deal. The company is going all in on Cloudflare One, Gateway, Access, CASB, DLP and Magic WAN. They were drawn to Cloudflare's platform as a unified pane of glass to consolidate their security modernization and network transformation needs, with Magic WAN as a key competitive differentiator versus first-generation Zero Trust competitors. \n A global industrial machinery manufacturer expanded their relationship with us by signing a 3-year $648,000 deal.  The company was looking to modernize their security infrastructure and is also going all in on Cloudflare One with Access, Gateway, Area 1 and Magic WAN, displacing multiple competitors. They appreciate being able to consolidate vendors, reduce costs and increase flexibility with Cloudflare's platform. \n A Fortune 1000 SaaS company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a 3-year $8.4 million deal. The company recognized Cloudflare's unique position as a neutral super cloud to manage and strengthen their application security posture and accelerated SaaS platform performance across AWS, GCP and their private data center environment. Additionally, no other solution could compete with our data localization suite to simplify the customer's global regulatory and compliance requirements. A leading IoT security company expanded their relationship with us, signing 2 3-year deals for a combined $4.2 million, one for its commercial business and a FedRAMP one for its government business. \n The company has been a Cloudflare customer since 2020 using core application services and Cloudflare Tunnel for IoT devices. Drawn to our pace of innovation, this customer bought into the Cloudflare platform vision, now using over 25 products across core application services, Zero Trust and our developer platform, including R2, our object store and durable objects, combat high egress fees from AWS. They plan to use Cloudflare's FedRAMP authorization to scale operations on both commercial and federal sides of their business and increase their security posture. \n A Fortune 1000 retailer signed a $1.3 million 46-month contract for Cloudflare's core application services to displace their existing vendor. They also added R2. The company has been dissatisfied with the unpredictability of their bills and bot-related issues from the current vendor and wanted to switch to Cloudflare, knowing our universal approach to protecting all traffic and our platform ease of use were top of the industry. \n A leading gaming company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, moving from a pay-as-you-go customer spending $200 a month to a contracted customer signing a 1-year $388,000 deal for R2, Workers and application services. The company was looking for a more scalable platform for storage and outperformance that would support their exponential growth. The customer realized that by moving to R2, they could eliminate egress fees they were incurring from the competitor, easily integrate with S3 APIs and centralized management. In particular, they were impressed with R2's lower latency and better throughput as well as how R2 tightly integrates with Workers and our core application services. \n Traction among developers continues to be strong. We now have 4.92 million Workers applications running on our platform, up 146% over the last 6 months. 33,000 paying customers have activated R2 and are storing more than 7 petabytes of data, up 25% quarter-over-quarter. AI companies, large and small, continue to build on Cloudflare at a breakneck pace. When we ask them why, they cite our neutral position, rapid innovation and modern, nimble development environment. One last month called us \"The first cloud infrastructure company built for the age of AI.\" I like the ring of that. \n And I'm extremely excited about our upcoming announcement at Developer Week next month. We'll announce a lot around how we support AI and make any developer more productive. We are the best in the industry at innovation and we're making the changes we need to make and investing in our team to be the best in the industry of sales, too. \n As I step back and think about what was a challenging quarter, I'm struck by our opportunity. We are not limited by the market for our products. We are not limited by innovation. We are not limited by pipeline opportunity. We are not limited by our ability to recruit. And we are not even limited by sales capacity. Instead, we are limited by our go-to-market performance. That's something we can fix, and we are committed to turning the current macroeconomic headwinds into a catalyst for positive change in growth at Cloudflare by investing in our top talent, refocusing on performance management and elevating the productivity of our team to seize the opportunity we have ahead, which we all know is massive. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas to walk through the financials. Thomas, take it away. Yes, Sterling. The AI is something that I think surprised us last quarter in terms of the positive impact when it continues to surprise us. We've seen the revenue that's coming from AI companies just quarter-over-quarter have substantial growth north of 20% quarter-over-quarter growth from the large AI companies that use us. And it's not just 1 or 2, but from large to small. What we're hearing from AI companies is that as they look to who they're going to use for their infrastructure and they can start with a clean slate, that Cloudflare is a part of that and that we're helping them go fast, compete, get the most efficiency, be able to protect themselves from some of the significant cybersecurity and fraud risks that they face. .\n And that continues to be something that is delivering really positive results for us. I think you're going to see us during our developer week next month in May, highlight some of these customer stories and highlight ways that AI companies are using Cloudflare in order to push that innovation forward. So I think that, that has continued to be a real positive for us, and that has only accelerated from even Q4. Yes. I think that everyone continues to communicate to us that they are -- that they want to continue to invest with us. I think what we're seeing from IT organizations is that they're all looking very critically at their budgets and asking themselves what projects can they delay versus what projects do they have to invest in. So we continue to see when companies are under duress, when they're under attack, that those deals are closing extremely quickly. But some of the times where people are initiating a new large project around moving to a Zero Trust environment or something else that would be a larger initiative that the sales cycles on those projects are extending beyond where they were before. \n I think one of the things that's unique about Cloudflare is even with the extended sales cycles, our sales cycles tend to, on average, be significantly faster than the peers in our industry. And so back in early 2022, we were among the first to call the slowdown in the economy because we could see the sales cycles slow down. That -- they picked back up, but then again, are slowing down right now. I think we tend to see that earlier than some of our peers. And I think that one of the things that has always characterized how we think about our business is real prudence as we look forward. So no one is telling us that projects are getting canceled in any significant way. \n But people are saying budgets are tight, we're being more cautious, and that is taking our sales cycles to be longer than we have historically seen and longer even than the elevation that we saw through the back half of 2022. So we're trying to be very prudent about how we think about this. But customers continue to tell us they're not switching to another competitor. They're not -- we haven't seen any elevation in loss rates to the competition. Quite the opposite. People are saying we want to invest with you, we're just being cautious with our IT spend, and that's causing everyone to measure twice before they cut once. Well, I think it's a combination of both of those things, if we're honest. I think that the fact that the macro economy has gotten harder exposed some of the weaknesses in some of the sellers on our team. When things were cruising along in 2021, again, you didn't have to be a really disciplined seller in order to be successful at Cloudflare. And I think that, that, combined with some of the -- what happened during COVID, combined with our hesitancy in terms of what the opportunity costs were in terms of replacing people when  the tech employment market was overheating, all combined to have us get to a place where we just had a number of people on our team who weren't performing. \n And I think Marc has done an incredible job at really identifying specifically who those people are and starting the process of moving those people off. What I see, though, is that if you look at our top sellers, they are enjoying incredible success and where the lowest performing sellers decelerated substantially during the macroeconomic slowdown, the top sellers on our team have seen around a 1% decrease in their productivity. And so what that indicates to me is that with new leaders like Marc who are on board and some of the lieutenants that he is bringing on and the incredible talent which is applying to Cloudflare. Again, 0.25 million people applied to work for us in Q1. I don't know of any other SaaS company that is seeing that volume of talent that is out there. \n People want to come work for us. The people who are successful at Cloudflare can be extremely productive and can do well themselves as sellers. And I think Marc is bringing in a focus and a discipline which is going to pay off. And the thing that's, I think, very encouraging is, as we look at the people that we can replace that -- that they are contributing such a small percentage in terms of our capacity that we actually think that this will -- any type of change like this obviously has -- is something that we want to do very humanely and we want to be very thoughtful about taking care of the team that we have. \n But we think that as we transition that team out we're going to not only increase the performance of our high performers but bring on new performers that give us much higher performing capacity, and Marc, I think is doing an incredible job at not only identifying who has to be moved out. But boy, when I talk to the people that we're hiring to replace those people, I just get incredibly excited by what they are able to deliver to us. I think that what we're seeing is, again, weakness across the entire space. Pay as you go, remember, is a relatively small percentage of our overall business, less than 15% of revenue. So it doesn't move the needle one direction or another. But we definitely are seeing that there is a lower rate of upgrade. But at the same time, we are not seeing that there is a lower rate of downgrade. What I am excited by is the developer traction that we're seeing across our business. \n The fact that we're closing in on 5 million applications running across the platform. That -- the majority of those are coming from pay-as-you-go developers. And that continues to be a pipeline where we see lots of success. We also have examples like the one that cited in the prepared remarks, where we had a customer that was paying us $200 a month that we identify, worked with and were able to upgrade to an enterprise customer spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year with us. \n So pay-as-you-go continues to pay lots of dividends. But I think that the same conservativeness where people are just watching their budgets much more carefully shows up across the entire space. And that -- and we don't see a significant difference at the low end of our business versus the high end of the business. Keith, I think that as we've put a floodlight on it, the biggest thing that changed is sales cycle length, more than 25%. And so that pushed back a lot of what was happening in the quarter. We would typically see about half of our business close in the last month of the quarter. I think the fact that you had the uncertainty around the bank. And again, it wasn't just customers of SVB or Credit Suisse, but it was entire spaces where purchasing departments really said -- I mean they got very nervous regardless of who they were banking with. \n And we just saw more companies push pause on that. That pushed a lot of our business into the last half of March and it pushed some of our business outside of the -- of closing within the quarter. And so what we don't know is whether March is the new reality, in which case, again, I think we want to be very prudent as how we think about the business going forward or if the world will snap back fairly quickly. \n The early reads that we're seeing are not that we're -- again, it doesn't feel like it's getting significantly worse, but we don't also see things getting significantly better. But that, again, as we've sort of shone a floodlight on what was it that changed -- what changed is a material change in the length of the sales cycles, the win rates didn't change, but the close rates did. I think we continue to have extremely fast close rate when someone is under duress. So when they see that there is a problem and they need -- and they need to address it. I think -- and that doesn't change quarter-over-quarter for, I think, obvious reasons. We are able to respond very quickly, and someone's offline, we bring them back online. And those deals close often a matter of hours. The things that -- other things that showed a lot of promise in the quarter were things like R2, where we're increasingly seeing large customers bring over larger and larger data sets. \n But across the board, we were saying that anything that requires sort of a larger IT commitment, customers were again measuring twice before they cut once, and there was a material increase in sales cycles. What I think is different about us and a lot of other companies is that we see things faster because even with the 25% increase in sales cycles, we're still significantly faster sales cycles than most other SaaS companies. And so I think we see things earlier, and what we don't know again is that they a radical change to how procurement departments are thinking about IT spending. \n That is what we are trying to be prudent around when we think about guidance. Or is it something that was just a short-term effect of sort of the anxiety in March around the banking sector? And I think that this quarter -- this next quarter will prove out which direction that goes. But we want to be extremely prudent and cautious as we think about things going forward. I think we're -- I think that's always been part of our playbook. And I think that what we are able to do because of the broad set of products that we have is find lots of different ways into a customer's account. And so that is, I think, a -- that's something that we're able to do, and I think we can maintain gross margins that are within our 75% to 77% target range. I think it's a mistake for us to dramatically take that gross margin rate down over time. But I think that we can actually bundle and discount and go after even small deals because of the margin profile that we have and then use the engineering that we have in order to deliver still the gross margins that we expect. \n So we're not changing what our gross margin targets are. We are not losing deals on price. And we've been able to continue to be extremely competitive and deliver an extremely high ROI while also delivering software gross margins. I think that we're still in the early days of that, but encouraging. We were able to win a federal deal, which continues to expand in partnership with Accenture. And that has given them confidence to take us to market in a number of other partnership and global deals. I think that Marc has been great in terms of bringing real focus on partnerships and thinking about what are the parts of the market that we want to serve directly versus what are the parts of the market that we want to serve with partners. And I think as we have these early wins, that begets our ability to win more with the large global systems integrators and other large partners. \n They're seeing the same thing that we are. When we talk -- when I talk to them, they're seeing very much a conservatism around IT spend. That, I think, is less pronounced in the security space. And so I think that there is more willingness and eagerness to work with us. But when we talk to the systems integrators and other large partners, especially at the high end of the market, I think that they are reflecting the same sort of conservatism of measure multiple times before you cut that they're seeing from their customers. \n And I think that it continues to be a large opportunity and something that, especially in Zero Trust and Workers we're seeing that we can deliver more with them. But I think that, that is a place where we've actually seen IT shops look at ways of making sure that they're being as optimal as possible. Yes. They tend to be larger than the average deal. But we land $10 million-plus deals on our own as well. I think over time, you'll see us, again, work more closely with those SIs and other partners to deliver some of the larger deals and make sure that we can make inroads into more accounts and use them as a way to help integrate larger solutions together. So again, I think it's something that is a priority for us. I think we have the early wins, but now we need to continue to scale those programs. Yes. I understand that, that would be handy if we could point to that. I don't think that that's what we're seeing right now. I think that we have actually seen our top sellers be more productive. I think that the changes that Marc is putting in place really are starting with these changes now. And that obviously does introduce uncertainties. We think we have our handle around that. I think we've planned that extremely well. \n And again, I think that as we look out at the caliber and quality of the people who we can bring on board and how we can invest in our top performers today, just getting our sales performance to look much more like a normal distribution than what today is much more of a bimodal distribution is an extremely effective way for us to reaccelerate the growth that we have. And so the changes that Marc is making are the right changes. Our team, the highest performing individual contributors and managers on our team are leaning forward and e-mailing me every day about how great it is to have an additional amount of rigor and discipline. \n There may be bumps along the road. These transitions do take time. But I think we are on the right path. Marc is the right person. Across our team the feedback that we're getting is extremely positive. And again, we're not limited by the market for our products. We're not limited by innovation. We're not limited by pipeline. We're not even limited really by sales capacity even as we transition people off of our team. \n And so that gives me a lot of confidence going forward that while we will continue to see pressure from the macroeconomic conditions over the next year, I am -- I really am excited for as we have our sales engine match our innovation engine, what we're going to be able to deliver as a company. Thank you so much. Really appreciate everybody tuning in for the call. This has definitely been a quarter of contrast but it is an incredible opportunity for us to continue to make Cloudflare a better company. \n I appreciate all of the hard work from all of our team. We are excited for the quarter ahead. I hope to see many of you at our Investor Day on May 4, and make sure to tune in the following week for Developer Week. There are a number of incredible announcements coming. Thank you so much."

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our first speaker, Phil Winslow. Please go ahead.\nPhil Winslow: Thank you for joining us today to discuss Cloudflare\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of 2024.

We would also like to inform you that we will be participating in the RBC Capital Markets Global PIMC Conference on November 20th and the Wells Fargo 8th Annual TMC Summit on December 4th. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matt.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. We are pleased with our results for the third quarter, exceeding expectations for revenue, operating margin, and free cash flow while also reaching what I believe is a critical inflection point in our rebuild of our go-to-market organization. During the third quarter, we achieved revenue of $430.1 million, up 28% year-over-year. We added a record 219 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, and now have 3,265 large customers up 28% year-over-year. We also achieved a new milestone of counting 35% of the Fortune 500 as paying Cloudflare customers. Revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter remained consistent at 67% up from 65% in the third quarter last year. Our dollar-based net retention was 110%, down 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. While customer churn remains consistently low, our shift to more pool of funds deals with our largest customers, which represented nearly 10% of new ACV booked in the quarter, up from 1% a year ago has put downward pressure on dollar-based net retention and changed the shape of revenue recognition in the short term. Over the long term, however, we believe pool of fund deals are very positive for the business as they represent our largest customers making a broad commitment to Cloudflare's overall platform. Our gross margin was 78.8%, remaining above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%, and up a tad from 78.7% in the same quarter last year. We delivered an operating profit of $63.5 million, representing an operating margin of 14.8%. Our continued strength in operating margin underscores our commitment to operational efficiency and productivity. Free cash flow came in at $45.3 million, ahead of expectations even as we are investing in our network and enhance capabilities like faster, more capable GPUs around the world. In Q3, the IT spending environment remained consistent with prior quarters with customers closely scrutinizing every deal, emphasizing cost efficiency and seeking meaningful ROI. This cautious approach isn't new, it's something we understand and they must have, not a nice to have benefit from relative to some of our peers. Moreover, our broad platform has allowed us to sell multiple problems for customers from a single vendor, giving us an advantage over many of our point solution competitors. However, some larger deals slipped out of the quarter in the U.S. in particular, during what was a transitional period under new sales leadership in that region. These deals are still active in our pipeline with many having already closed this quarter. Although changes in our sales force may have impacted the short-term cadence of some larger deal cycles. What stood out to me is that the third quarter felt like we hit the inflection point in the rebuild of our go-to-market team. Mark Anderson has lived up to being a world-class sales leader he hired stage appropriate talent across our go-to-market organization than fair but relentless of performance management and brought disciplined focus to our team. That's showing in the numbers. Our sales productivity has continued to improve and is now back around the best levels we saw in 2022. Mark believes there's still significant headroom above where we are as we focus not on batting average, but on slugging percentage, shifting more of our account executives to enterprise sales with higher quotas and the ability to sell bigger deals. As we've worked through performance management and up-leveling the team, our ramp rep capacity has been essentially flat for the last four quarters. When I said we've hit an inflection point, this is the biggest thing that I'm watching. Starting in 2025, we expect the number of ramped reps will begin to increase meaningfully again, but with a shift towards more real sluggers who can bring in more enterprise deals. To make it tangible, nearly 70% of new sales hires this year are in the Enterprise segment compared with 40% on average over the prior two years. As you may recall from Mark's presentation at Investor Day earlier this year, momentum in ACV growth is a product of sales capacity times productivity. We've made all of improvements in productivity. Now we're about to start to see the capacity of our sales force reaccelerate. I'm excited to be coming out the other side of our go-to-market transformation, and we expect these initiatives will deliver improving ACV momentum in the coming quarters. As I've shared with some of you, if I think about the last 15 years at Cloudflare, there's always something that I'm worried about, something that's broken or as Michelle would say, an opportunity to improve. It's always tended to be one of three things; sales, stability or shipping. I picture it serves like a hockey puck sliding around points in a triangle etched in the ice. You get good at selling a product to more demanding customers buy it. that causes whatever level of service that was acceptable before to no longer be acceptable to you focus on improving stability. And as you have demanding customers and have put in place better systems and processes to ensure stability, it starts to hamstring your ability to ship new products. At some level, my job is to live [indiscernible] so I started to worry about go-to-market a few years ago. About a year ago, it became clear that we were going to be able to bring on Mark Anderson and meaningfully up-level vaccine. Right on queue, as I stopped worrying about go-to-market, we suffered the stability in sense of last year. We focus on things and we fix them. And today, our stability, even with our broad products and more demanding customers is world-class. So I was gearing up to start worrying about shipping when ahead of schedule, I got introduced to CJ Desai, one of the most proven product and engineering leaders who is now our Chief Product and Engineering Officer. The team knows how to shift. So now I find myself in the strange position of having to look for new things to worry about in the medium term. Undoubtedly, given our ambition, we'll find new challenges, but I imparted that incredible leaders like Mark Anderson, CJ Desai, Stephanie Cohen, all of whom had incredible offers to be CEOs and other organizations believe in Cloudflare's mission and the opportunity we have to build the next iconic technology company to turn down those other offers and join our team over the last year. With that, let me turn to some customer wins in the quarter. A rapidly growing AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $7 million pool of funds contracts for Workers AI. This company signed a $500,000 contract in Q2 for Cloudflare to be their platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization and application security. They quickly recognize the value of our platform and are now moving all of their workloads over to make Cloudflare their single inference cloud platform. With Workers AI, this customer is able to improve cost efficiency with our paper inference model and also eliminate the need for a dedicated team to run and manage their infrastructure. Realizing a nearly 2 times performance improvement over traditional public clouds with Workers AI was just the cherry on top. This win is just the beginning for Workers AI. A rapidly growing technology company signed a 3.5-year $2.4 million contract for R2, Workers and Application Security. Key concerns for this customer were high egress fees, unpredictable cost spikes and vendor lock-in with a hyperscale public cloud provider, and they viewed R2 as a strategic tool to allow them to unlock paths to realize the full benefits of the cloud with cloud. With Cloudflare's Workers, R2 and Application Services all on one platform, this customer was able to increase their global application performance by 3.5x and drive down their TCO. This customer is also working closely with our product team on some exciting new developments around Workers AI. A rapidly growing operator of a large satellite Internet constellation signed a three year $4 million pool of funds contract for our full suite of FedRAMP products. Given the importance of security, performance and data sovereignty in this industry, this customer quickly looked to Cloudflare to become a strategic partner that can help them build and operationalize their design and network long term. A Fortune 100 technology company signed a two year $4.2 million contract. This customer sought resiliency on their most critical dynamic traffic, which was previously only routed through a centralized hyperscaler. With CloudFlare, they were not only able to gain greater resiliency, but also realize better performance and more robust security capabilities. We continue to see resiliency emerged as a key theme, enabling Cloudflare to establish a beachhead inside large enterprise accounts alongside incumbent providers. A Global 2000 manufacturing company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a three year $2.4 million contract for 45,000 Zero trustees, along with Magic WAN and Magic Firewall to provide secure access to more than 600 offices. Their multi-vendor incumbent architecture with a first-generation Zero Trust competitor and other on-premise vendors led to gaps in security and a lack of visibility. After evaluating several vendors, Cloudflare demonstrated a superior technical solution to their 200 use cases in addition to increasing their security posture and consolidating multiple point solutions onto a unified SaaS platform. In the words of the customer, Cloudflare's a Swiss Army knife, we can do so many things. A large technology company in Europe, expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $5.3 million contract for more than 40,000 seats of access gateway data loss prevention, along with remote grower isolation, workers and application security. With the company looking to not only enhance its security posture but also consolidate onto one platform, our innovative Zero Trust road map was a key differentiator. In the words of the customer, we are an engineering-driven company. We build most of our tech so we want something modern, effective and secure. Finally, I wanted to congratulate President Trump on his election victory and I'll also recognize Vice President, Harris for a hard-fought campaign. Both candidates were Cloudflare customers. Both were targeted by cyberattacks and I'm proud that we were able to defend them both without incident. I'm even more proud of something else. More than half of U.S. states and most of the so-called battleground states rely on Cloudflare's Athenian project where we provide free service to any official administering elections, whether they're in red, blue or purple states. We couldn't have built Cloudflare without a stable functioning political system. And key to that is making sure that you can trust the democratic process. I wanted to thank our team who've been on call for the last several months and especially over the last few weeks to come to the aid of election officials and campaigns whenever they've had a need. There will be lots of stories from the 2024 presidential election that cyberattacks won't be a meaningful part of any of them, and I'm proud that Cloudflare is part of the reason why. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the third quarter as we made further progress on our go-to-market transformation delivering another double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity. However, sales cycles leased during the quarter and some larger deals slipped out of the quarter in the U.S., in particular, Importantly, these are still active deals. As Matthew mentioned earlier, the third quarter marked a key inflection point in our go-to-market transformation with net sales capacity having bottomed. Similar to last quarter, we continued to increase hiring in our sales organization with a particular focus on onboarding enterprise account executives with proven track records. We expect the number of brands enterprise account executives to accelerate exiting 2024 and throughout 2025, and this is particularly the case in the U.S. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 28% year-over-year to $430.1 million. The third quarter was highlighted by ongoing strength in pool or fund contract momentum with Wake and continued high prioritization of security by our customers. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 50% of revenue and increased 22% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 31% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue, an increase of 38% year-over-year. We were again pleased to see a notable uptick in both sequential and year-over-year growth in APAC. Turning to our customer metrics. In the third quarter, we had about 221,500 paying customers, an increase of 22% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 3,265 large customers representing an increase of 28% year-over-year and a record addition of 219 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar-based net retention was 110% during the third quarter, representing a decrease of 2 percentage points sequentially. The decline in D&R was driven by slower net expansion in our larger customer cohort increased platform deals in the form of cooler funds contracts, which, as a reminder, reduce friction to adoption across our product portfolio that can impact the shape of review recognition as well as deferred revenue, TRPO and cash flow and anniversarying the price increase to our Pro and business [payroll] (ph) plans last year. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect new customers to contribute a higher percentage of our overall year-over-year revenue growth for the next several quarters. Moving to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin was 78.8% and representing a decrease of 20 basis points sequentially and an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 10% of revenue in the third quarter. During the quarter, we saw a notable shift in customer conversations and buying behavior from AI trading to AI inference, including our first multimillion dollar workers AI contract. This gives us confidence to continue to increase our investment in higher-end GPUs as well as the breadth of our GPU rollout as we provision greater capacity to support demand in 2025. As. A result, we continue to expect network CapEx to increase again in the fourth quarter to reach 10% to 12% of revenue for the full year 2024. Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2% year-over-year to 64% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 18% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to about 4,200 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $160.2 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 37% from 38% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $70.5 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 16% compared to the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $45 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 10% from 11% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $63.5 million, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year compared to $42.5 million in the same period last year. Third quarter operating margin was 14.8%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $72.6 million or diluted net income per share of $0.20. Maintaining our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and acting as good stewards of investors' capital we ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $45.3 million in the quarter or 11% of revenue compared to $34.9 million or 10% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $1.53 billion. representing an increase of 6% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Current RPO was 70% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the third quarter, and we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024 and as we reach a key inflection point in our go-to-market transformation. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $451 million to $452 million. representing an increase of 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating income in the range of $57 million to $58 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 16%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.18, assuming approximately 360 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of EUR 1.661 billion to $1.662 billion, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $220 million to $221 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 13% for 2024. We expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.74, assuming approximately 357 million shares outstanding. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to analyze our ability to implement certain tax planning strategies in order to manage current and future cash tax liabilities. We will provide an update once this tax planning review is completed, if the outcome were to impact our expectations for Cloudflare's non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Regardless of the outcome, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19% to 22% beginning in 2025. However, I would remind everyone that we still have significant net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit attributes are available to offset cash taxes in the future. We expect free cash flow to be consistent with our prior guidance of approximately $160 million to $164 million for the full year 2024. In closing, our teams remain committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them modernize, transform and secure their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew, please go ahead.\nMatthew Hedberg: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Congrats on the results. Matthew, maybe I'll start with you. In the past, you've talked about sort of the crystal ball nature of Cloudflare. And I guess I'm wondering, when you look into that crystal ball now, what is it telling you about the external business environment? And then perhaps could you give a bit more color on -- maybe even the quantity of the U.S. based slip deals?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Matt, first of all, thank you for the question. I am not shy about talking about what we see or talking about macro concerns that are out there. I don't think that we see anything that is worse than in fact, I think we see an environment that maybe is ever have slightly improved. We saw real strength actually in Europe. I know a number of other companies haven't seen the same, but we executed well there and continue to see strength there. Asia has performed very well. And actually, from everything we've seen in the crystal ball, North America is -- has leveled off to slightly improved. I think we're where we have room to improve ourselves and where I'm optimistic looking forward is around our own internal execution. It has nothing to do with the macro. And the good news is that with our team in Europe, which has seen the most consistent sales productivity over the last eight quarters, I've had sales productivity increased by 22% year-over-year in Q3. They are running the playbook that we're running now in North America. There's a smaller team, so it's faster for us to be able to make those changes, but that's work. Same thing in Asia where they saw actually a sales productivity bump of 40% over the past 3 quarters. and they had the highest productivity of any region this year. So I think the macro -- I don't think there's anything about the macro that gives us more pause today than before. If anything, I think it's improving. And what I'm very optimistic about is that the places where we've already gotten through our improvement of our go-to-market team, we're seeing the benefits of that. And now we're rolling that out to our largest market, and we see that in Q1, you see a dramatic increase starting in the number of ramped reps and that gives me a lot of confidence and the consistency of the macro also allows us to invest with confidence.\nMatthew Hedberg: Got it. Thanks. Maybe just a quick one, a follow-up for Thomas. The pool of fund deals seems like it's pressuring NRR, maybe even CRPO in revenue. Is there a way or I guess, how would you have us think through the impact of that, especially as we kind of think towards 2025? I know it's a short-term thing, and it certainly benefits the long-term model, but any sort of guidepost that you can give us on the relative impact?\nThomas Seifert: Yes. We gave a couple of that on the call. So the share of cooler funds deals in the quarter now creep up to 10%, which is a good result. It will pressure as you rightfully said, in the short term, but I think it takes friction out of the process for our customers consuming our products and services moving forward. So we think that this is going to be with us for the next two to three quarters, but provides all the upside from an expansion of the decrease of freedom we have and our customers have to expand moving forward.\nMatthew Hedberg: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Andrew, please go ahead.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Good afternoon and congrats on the nice quarter. I want to start with a question on your AI. So you mentioned that a number of conversations with customers began to shift this quarter from AI training to AI inference, and I think you signed a large workers AI deal. Just give any more color on the AI landscape and some of the feedback you're hearing on Workers AI?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Andy. Thanks for the question. I'm really amazed at how quickly the AI platform that we launched is taking off and how many people are getting real value from it. And so as we mentioned, one of the leading AI companies signed a $7 million one year contract with us to move their inference to our platform. What they saw was that they were able to get significantly better performance while also being able to run at a much higher ROI on the investment that they made over what they were seeing, trying to manage it themselves through hyperscale public cloud. That's a story that is playing out over and over again. I think it's a story that is accelerating. And in order to support that, we have made the investments to increase not only just the number, but also the power of the GPUs that we're deploying around the world. What I think is unique about Cloudflare is two things. One, we are actually able to deliver inference incredibly close to where anyone is on earth because we've deployed the inference capabilities across at this point, nearly all of our network. But in addition to that, we've actually done the work to get higher utilization out of those same GPU resources where what we see when we survey customers that are trying to manage this themselves, through hyperscale public cloud is that they're getting utilization rates that are sort of in the 5% to 10% range of the resources that they're buying. We're able to deliver much higher utilization. And in the process of that, that means that we can actually pass on the effective savings to our customers. So they not only save in not having to maintain their own team to manage these virtual machines and containers, but they also save because we can just do more with the same GPU resources that are being deployed. So I'm incredibly excited that this is something which I think we have sort of started -- we're starting to shift to people who have built their models and how they actually want to deploy them in customer-facing ways. And when they do that, I think Workers AI is the most powerful platform to be able to deliver inference tasks at a global level.\nAndrew Nowinski: Thank you. That was really helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about just the team you've built. I think you've done a really nice job building out one of the best management teams in the industry and including the recent hire of CJ. So and you seem to find a new way to use your network with a new product every quarter, but I'm wondering if you can give us any color in terms of the direction that CJ wants to take Cloudflare's product development?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I'm just really honored by the caliber of people who have chosen to take the next stage of their career and bet on Michelle and my vision for the future of what Cloudflare is. And so Mark Anderson, CJ Desai, Stephanie Collin, and it goes down the list of top both managers but then also top individual contributors the caliber of talent that we get is remarkable. We're on pace to probably have over 1.5 million applicants that apply to work at Cloudflare in 2024. And we're just getting the cream of the crop of people. Those are obviously names that you all recognize. But across our entire team, I did an orientation session today, and it was just remarkable to see all of the people who are betting on Cloudflare's vision. And that gives me an enormous amount of hope that we will continue to be able to drive incredible innovation over the long term. I think CJ really brings a number of different things. One of them that I really love is his understanding and focus on the enterprise. And so, as we are building out a go-to-market team that is now able to sell very large deals to very important customers. What I referenced in my prepared remarks was that, that would then put pressure on our product and engineering team to make sure that they could deliver those enterprise-class features to satisfy what our sales team delivered. And see, there's no one in the world who is better at that than CJ. And so we're honored to have him on board. The team is incredibly excited to be working with him. And I think just watch this space because there's going to be a lot of exciting development to come.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. I'll add my congrats, and I agree with Andy that I think CJ is just an incredible hire. Matthew, it seems like you're capable of adding about 100,000 new developers per month, I believe, onto the platform. I think you crossed 2 million or 3 million developers. And now you have vectorized, you have hyperdrive. There's so many new products. The stats out there, there are 30 million to 100 million developers depending on how you define it. How many of those do you think are viable candidates for Cloudflare? And what do you think is attainable over time? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I mean, I think all of them are viable candidates for Cloudflare. And we want to make the platform support any of their needs. That doesn't mean that every application is going to make sense to run on Cloudflare. If you have a legacy application, if you're trying to run SAP HANA, we're not the right place to do that. But if you're the company that's building the thing that's going to disrupt SAP HANA, then we're absolutely the place to do that. And so if you look across the AI ecosystem, if you look across the sort of blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. If you look across anywhere where someone is able to start with a blank slate, we're seeing adoption rates in the top start-ups, top companies in those spaces that are well north of 50%, and in some cases, well north of 25% of the industry. So what we think the excitement around the platform is palpable, and it has again taken off much faster. I think our secret is that customer zero for everything that we do at Cloudflare is Cloudflare ourselves. And that's been a great formula. If we build things that our own developers want it turns out a lot of other developers want to develop the same way that Close does. And that's driving, I think, a lot of excitement and a lot of interest in the platform.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. I appreciate that. As a follow-up, there have been a couple of comments now that the AI models are advancing so fast as they're actually doubling every 6 months. which is hard to believe they're advancing so fast and now I think we're looking at the reasoning and the long-duration inference. We're starting to hear the inferencing is going to have to be [multimodal] (ph) and using InfiniBand. It's a pretty big step up. And so I'm just curious maybe how you see that developing? And how might that play into your architecture as these models just become so much more demanding?\nMatthew Prince: I think that we're really good at figuring out how to make very complicated, hard cash distributed across our network. And so far, what we're seeing is that even in cases where there are models that maybe need more than 1 machine to run we've been able to very efficiently do the hard engineering work to split that apart in ways that often might be different than how some others are approaching it, but get a much higher level of utilization. At the core of Cloudflare, the first thing that we really did was we've built a network where we could move data faster, more reliably, more efficiently, meaning cheaper and more securely than anyone else. And that then means that we can oftentimes take an inference task, maybe the big inference task is going to take some time. It might be that we don't answer it as close to the user as possible. It might be that we spread that out across multiple different machines and then pull the answer back. And those might be on the other side of the earth in some cases. And so that network and that ability for us to utilize the entire network we have and effectively squeeze as much efficiency out and squeeze as much utilization out as possible. that's been key to what we've done across the board with CPUs, with memory, with storage, with networking and now we're running the same play with GPUs. And so, so far, there haven't been -- we have not hit limits that our engineering team hasn't found ways around. And I think that we're -- we feel pretty optimistic that even as AI continues to accelerate, the place that you're going to want to do inference is on Cloudflare's network.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Good afternoon. Matthew, just on the go-to-market changes. There have been questions just in terms of when you talk about the pushouts, we always see this and you've seen this in past quarters. Was this quarter more pronounced on the pushouts? Or is this just something you're commenting, hey, made some sales changes this is the natural side effect. I think was kind of just curious about the magnitude of that push. Was that greater or kind of equal to what you've seen historically in past quarters?\nMatthew Prince: I think that it was -- I think that what we saw this quarter that was a little bit different as we started to see the capacity held it back at some level. And that we had had to, especially in North America cut deeper than I think we initially expected. And Mark, I think, did a great job with performance management coming in and continue to do the hard work, finding the really great people on our team and make sure that they were taken care of, but also finding people that weren't going to be up to snuff and move them off the team. What I think is the big change, though, is I think we see the inflection point for that, and we've crossed it, we're really starting in Q1 the capacity. And we know that that's going to tick up because those are people who are already on the team. They're just ramping, right? And we know what the ramp rates are. We know how that builds. The capacity starts to really tick up in Q1. And assuming we're continuing to be able to hire the plan, which we expect we'll be able to given the caliber and quality of the candidates that we get, that continues to tick up over the course of 2025. So I don't think there was something that was dramatically different. I do think that we have made the productivity gains we've seen the success in other regions, and now we're bringing that to what is our largest market, which is North America. And we see again that inflection point in the not-too-distant future.\nBrent Thill: Okay. And you called out Workers and you've been talking about this for a while but I guess how important is this now in the overall platform shift in adoption? How are you seeing this as customers are coming to you for multiple things. Are you seeing this as a big add-on big driver? How would you characterize where we're at in the adoption of Workers?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that I have -- we -- at Cloudflare, we always think that we're stacking different S curves one behind another. So we have older products that are in more mature markets. that are sort of at the tail end of their S curve. And those are great products, and we win a lot of deals from those. And those customers because we're best of breed in that often then adopt other parts of that. I think our -- where we're right in the sort of hockey stick growth, and we're seeing a lot of success is with our zero trust products, which are taking off. With Workers, I think that we are -- I keep thinking we're kind of in the beginning of that the S curve of growth. But before the S curve even in the beginning is steeper than I imagined and there's a lot that's there. But we are not, I would say, optimizing this as much for how do we extract the most revenue. I think we're still optimizing very much for adoption. And what I like is that oftentimes Workers becomes the conversation around how we actually adopt the entire platform because people want -- they want to sign a pool of funds deal because their developers are excited about what Workers delivers they don't know exactly how much of it they're going to use. They know that they're going to use the overall platform. But Workers has been oftentimes a place where people say, listen, I want to put this in place. I want to make sure Workers is part of that. And then oftentimes, we're finding that customers will use up their entire pool of funds well before the contract duration and oftentimes, what's driving that and just the excitement of their teams around building new tools on Workers.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nPhil Winslow: Just one moment, we are having connection problem with the operator.\nOperator: Sorry, everyone, for the confusion and delay. Okay. For the next question, we have Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Congrats on a very solid performance. For Thomas or Matthew, there's no question, the number of seven digit and probably eight digit transactions are on the rise. We've seen some companies, some security-related companies, assisting larger customers with financing-related activities. What's the current thinking along these lines? Is it something that your customers are beginning to talk to you about what would be the approach here? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: I guess I can take a stab at it, and then Thomas might have more. And Shaul, you're saying like financing so that they could spread payments out over a longer period of time? Or can you say more about what you -- what exactly are you thinking about -- saying about?\nShaul Eyal: Actually, as they grow with you and want to consume more of your services at times, and as get addicted to some of your services, they would add -- they would probably ask for flexibility assistance in terms of payments or maybe kind of asking you to utilize some of your balance sheet in their favor.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. We don't -- I mean, Thomas can add more, but we don't do any customer financing today. I think we have generally been the highest ROI provider. And because we're a SaaS service, you pay for it as you consume. I think that's often been different with hardware companies that might have a different model, but that isn't something that I'm aware of that there's a lot of demand for on our side. And Thomas, I don't know if there's anything you'd add?\nThomas Seifert: To finance customers doing business with us, this has not been a topic so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Tim, please go ahead.\nTimothy Horan: Hi, guys. There's a lot of moving parts, obviously, with the sales productivity and limited capacity there in the pooling. Can you maybe talk about the timing of when revenue growth can accelerate again. Do you think the fourth quarter around 25% guide, is that the bottom? Or do you think it's still a few more quarters out? And related to this, can you update us on what you think the timing of for the $5 billion revenue target that you have? And I had a quick product follow-up. Thank you.\nThomas Seifert: Yes. Thank you for the question. As we said before, for us, in our subscription business model, revenue is very much a lagging metric. Sales capacities is a product of the amount of headcount we have and the productivity progress they are making, this translates into pipeline and sales prospects, turns into ACV and then ACV is recognized ratably over the lifetime of the contract as revenue. So it's very much a lagging indicator. And as we said before, models like this, there are slow on their way down, but they're also slowing their way up. But the important part is, as you heard in Matthew's prepared remarks that we think we have reached this key inflection point with net sales capacity now, which is the leading growth indicator have been patent. So from there on, we expect sales activity translating the ACV moving forward and going up. And you see this already in those parts of the world where this conversion and transition has happened successfully. Revenue was up 38% already in APAC, and it was up 1% in Europe, which is our highest productivity region has been over the last several quarters. So we think we have bottomed out from a net sales capacity perspective, and move forward from there.\nTimothy Horan: And the $5 billion target may be what year? And then just on the product side, have you improved the process on going general availability with products? I know in the past, it took a little longer than expected. And I guess related to this, when do you think containers can hit GA? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: [Multiple Speakers] Yes. I would say I don't think that we wouldn't say things have taken longer than expected. I think that our strategy has always been to get products into the market as quickly as possible. Let people play with them and test them and use them, understand that they will be early products. And that's part of the power of having the millions of customers, tens of millions of customers that we do is that we can do that and get immediate product feedback and then iterate quickly and then use the GA process as a time to signal when it's the right time for products to be put in production used by our largest customers and have the confidence around. I think that has slowed down or accelerate. I think it's kind of always been the process that we've gone through. Some products take longer, some products take less time. Containers are already in market. We have a number of large customers that use them to do interesting things. How broadly we make that available is something that we are very much testing what I think doesn't make sense is to just release a product that doesn't have any differentiation doesn't have any advantage over existing container solutions. And so that's, I think, what we are talking to customers about. I think we're using our usual process. But Technically, there's nothing that keeps us from launching that tomorrow. I think what we want to do is make sure that when we do that it has such a compelling value proposition that it just becomes a no-brainer for people to use. Q - Timothy Horan Well, the strategy is working. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. Joel, please go ahead.\nJoel Fishbein: Thank you. Thanks for the question. Matthew, love to get an update from you on the public sector. Obviously, you've got [indiscernible] certification. You've seen some very good customers there. I just love to hear what's happening there. And then also as it relates to that, where they are, do you think they are in their adoption of inference? That would be really helpful. Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that public sector has been -- was really an area of strength for us in 2023. We have not -- it has not -- it continues to perform, but it hasn't I would say, been in 1 of our standout star. I think that, that is because we've been nurturing relationships, and I think that you'll see it reemerge as a real driver of growth for us going forward. But I think it has not been much of a standout as it was last year. I also -- what is -- I'm constantly reminded of is how the people who work in governments are almost by definition, mission-driven and they really appreciate the work that we do. And so the number of notes that I've gotten from very senior people across the U.S. government, thanking us for what we did around the election, making sure that any time there was a problem they knew that they could call on our team that we had people available 24 hours a day to help with any county official in any state, anywhere in the country that we're seeing some type of an attack. And I'm proud of what we've done with that. That is the most effective marketing that we can do for our public sector business. And what we find time and time again is that as we do those good works, it turns into significant deals for us going forward. And so I think that it will be a very big -- it will continue to be a big and growing part of our business. And we have the pieces in place now that there are really no roadblocks from us winning more federal business.\nJoel Fishbein: And do you feel like you have a sales capacity necessary there to hit that market?\nMatthew Prince: I think we're building that sales capacity out. I think we've got some really amazing leaders there. And I think that what Mark Anderson, the person who's now leading North America for us [indiscernible], who's got an enormous sort of pedigree of selling into federal markets. And we have reps that we've hired to cover that space and they're ramping. And I think that you'll see them be able to again deliver very large deals. I don\u2019t think that we are right now capacity constrained in the federal space.\nJoel Fishbein: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Jonathan, please go ahead.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good evening. Just wanted to get a little bit more color from some of the product side of things and particularly those around sort of the data orientation. Can you maybe give us a sense of how R2 and D1 are faring within your customer base? And whether these products are helping drive some of the growth around AI and sort of the inference modeling as well? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that R2 definitely is -- the magic continues to be that if you have a large data set and you need to move it to wherever there is excess GPU capacity that R2 is an ability to do that. And so I think that, especially in training workloads, we're seeing be something that is often the gateway into using the rest of Cloudflare. And then that is helping us win more and more of the AI workloads, especially on the inference side. I think D1, there is less that's driving in the AI space directly. It is more of a traditional SQL database. But I think these components together -- have come together where now people are building full applications on top of platform workers. So you need a database, you need an object store, you need all of these primitives and these primitives together are allowing us to win much more complicated applications, much more complicated workloads, and that's important. And we continue to innovate in that space. I think what we did with HyperDrive some of the announcements we had around Birthday Week, with Durable Objects and Durable Databases are really very unique primitives that you can only get on Cloudflare. And I think you're going to start to see applications that just would have been prohibitively difficult to build in the past, especially around synchronization worldwide. A lot of game companies are starting to use some of these primitives to be able to think their player states and things that were in the past, extremely difficult to build. That is something that I think you're going to see more and more applications that just couldn't be built anywhere other than Cloudflare. And that's -- I think that's incredibly exciting for the space.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: There's no further question at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Matthew Prince for closing remarks. Matthew?\nMatthew Prince: Thank you. We had a number of technical difficulties. I'm not going to try and take it personally that the afterhours stock went up the most when we were mute for a period of time. But I do appreciate all of the work that goes into not just these calls but really pulling together these quarters. We've got an incredible team that just continues to execute. That team is building and ramping now. And I just want to say thank you to everyone for all of the hard work over the course of the last quarter, especially over the course of this week, where we've been all hands on deck to make sure that the U.S. election went off without cyberattacks being a big part of it. Thank you so much, and we'll see you back here again next quarter.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the third quarter as we made further progress on our go-to-market transformation delivering another double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity. However, sales cycles leased during the quarter and some larger deals slipped out of the quarter in the U.S., in particular, Importantly, these are still active deals. As Matthew mentioned earlier, the third quarter marked a key inflection point in our go-to-market transformation with net sales capacity having bottomed. Similar to last quarter, we continued to increase hiring in our sales organization with a particular focus on onboarding enterprise account executives with proven track records. We expect the number of brands enterprise account executives to accelerate exiting 2024 and throughout 2025, and this is particularly the case in the U.S. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 28% year-over-year to $430.1 million. The third quarter was highlighted by ongoing strength in pool or fund contract momentum with Wake and continued high prioritization of security by our customers. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 50% of revenue and increased 22% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 31% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue, an increase of 38% year-over-year. We were again pleased to see a notable uptick in both sequential and year-over-year growth in APAC. Turning to our customer metrics. In the third quarter, we had about 221,500 paying customers, an increase of 22% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 3,265 large customers representing an increase of 28% year-over-year and a record addition of 219 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar-based net retention was 110% during the third quarter, representing a decrease of 2 percentage points sequentially. The decline in D&R was driven by slower net expansion in our larger customer cohort increased platform deals in the form of cooler funds contracts, which, as a reminder, reduce friction to adoption across our product portfolio that can impact the shape of review recognition as well as deferred revenue, TRPO and cash flow and anniversarying the price increase to our Pro and business [payroll] (ph) plans last year. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect new customers to contribute a higher percentage of our overall year-over-year revenue growth for the next several quarters. Moving to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin was 78.8% and representing a decrease of 20 basis points sequentially and an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 10% of revenue in the third quarter. During the quarter, we saw a notable shift in customer conversations and buying behavior from AI trading to AI inference, including our first multimillion dollar workers AI contract. This gives us confidence to continue to increase our investment in higher-end GPUs as well as the breadth of our GPU rollout as we provision greater capacity to support demand in 2025. As. A result, we continue to expect network CapEx to increase again in the fourth quarter to reach 10% to 12% of revenue for the full year 2024. Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2% year-over-year to 64% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 18% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to about 4,200 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $160.2 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 37% from 38% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $70.5 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 16% compared to the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $45 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 10% from 11% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $63.5 million, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year compared to $42.5 million in the same period last year. Third quarter operating margin was 14.8%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $72.6 million or diluted net income per share of $0.20. Maintaining our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and acting as good stewards of investors' capital we ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $45.3 million in the quarter or 11% of revenue compared to $34.9 million or 10% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $1.53 billion. representing an increase of 6% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Current RPO was 70% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the third quarter, and we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024 and as we reach a key inflection point in our go-to-market transformation. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $451 million to $452 million. representing an increase of 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating income in the range of $57 million to $58 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 16%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.18, assuming approximately 360 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of EUR 1.661 billion to $1.662 billion, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $220 million to $221 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 13% for 2024. We expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.74, assuming approximately 357 million shares outstanding. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to analyze our ability to implement certain tax planning strategies in order to manage current and future cash tax liabilities. We will provide an update once this tax planning review is completed, if the outcome were to impact our expectations for Cloudflare's non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Regardless of the outcome, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19% to 22% beginning in 2025. However, I would remind everyone that we still have significant net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit attributes are available to offset cash taxes in the future. We expect free cash flow to be consistent with our prior guidance of approximately $160 million to $164 million for the full year 2024. In closing, our teams remain committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them modernize, transform and secure their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Yes. We gave a couple of that on the call. So the share of cooler funds deals in the quarter now creep up to 10%, which is a good result. It will pressure as you rightfully said, in the short term, but I think it takes friction out of the process for our customers consuming our products and services moving forward. So we think that this is going to be with us for the next two to three quarters, but provides all the upside from an expansion of the decrease of freedom we have and our customers have to expand moving forward. To finance customers doing business with us, this has not been a topic so far. Yes. Thank you for the question. As we said before, for us, in our subscription business model, revenue is very much a lagging metric. Sales capacities is a product of the amount of headcount we have and the productivity progress they are making, this translates into pipeline and sales prospects, turns into ACV and then ACV is recognized ratably over the lifetime of the contract as revenue. So it's very much a lagging indicator. And as we said before, models like this, there are slow on their way down, but they're also slowing their way up.

And you see this already in those parts of the world where this conversion and transition has happened successfully. Revenue was up 38% already in APAC, and it was up 1% in Europe, which is our highest productivity region has been over the last several quarters. So we think we have bottomed out from a net sales capacity perspective, and move forward from there."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Phil. We are pleased with our results for the third quarter, exceeding expectations for revenue, operating margin, and free cash flow while also reaching what I believe is a critical inflection point in our rebuild of our go-to-market organization. During the third quarter, we achieved revenue of $430.1 million, up 28% year-over-year. We added a record 219 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, and now have 3,265 large customers up 28% year-over-year. We also achieved a new milestone of counting 35% of the Fortune 500 as paying Cloudflare customers. Revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter remained consistent at 67% up from 65% in the third quarter last year. Our dollar-based net retention was 110%, down 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. While customer churn remains consistently low, our shift to more pool of funds deals with our largest customers, which represented nearly 10% of new ACV booked in the quarter, up from 1% a year ago has put downward pressure on dollar-based net retention and changed the shape of revenue recognition in the short term. Over the long term, however, we believe pool of fund deals are very positive for the business as they represent our largest customers making a broad commitment to Cloudflare's overall platform. Our gross margin was 78.8%, remaining above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%, and up a tad from 78.7% in the same quarter last year. We delivered an operating profit of $63.5 million, representing an operating margin of 14.8%. Our continued strength in operating margin underscores our commitment to operational efficiency and productivity. Free cash flow came in at $45.3 million, ahead of expectations even as we are investing in our network and enhance capabilities like faster, more capable GPUs around the world. In Q3, the IT spending environment remained consistent with prior quarters with customers closely scrutinizing every deal, emphasizing cost efficiency and seeking meaningful ROI. This cautious approach isn't new, it's something we understand and they must have, not a nice to have benefit from relative to some of our peers. Moreover, our broad platform has allowed us to sell multiple problems for customers from a single vendor, giving us an advantage over many of our point solution competitors. However, some larger deals slipped out of the quarter in the U.S. in particular, during what was a transitional period under new sales leadership in that region. These deals are still active in our pipeline with many having already closed this quarter. Although changes in our sales force may have impacted the short-term cadence of some larger deal cycles. What stood out to me is that the third quarter felt like we hit the inflection point in the rebuild of our go-to-market team. Mark Anderson has lived up to being a world-class sales leader he hired stage appropriate talent across our go-to-market organization than fair but relentless of performance management and brought disciplined focus to our team. That's showing in the numbers. Our sales productivity has continued to improve and is now back around the best levels we saw in 2022. Mark believes there's still significant headroom above where we are as we focus not on batting average, but on slugging percentage, shifting more of our account executives to enterprise sales with higher quotas and the ability to sell bigger deals. As we've worked through performance management and up-leveling the team, our ramp rep capacity has been essentially flat for the last four quarters. When I said we've hit an inflection point, this is the biggest thing that I'm watching. Starting in 2025, we expect the number of ramped reps will begin to increase meaningfully again, but with a shift towards more real sluggers who can bring in more enterprise deals. To make it tangible, nearly 70% of new sales hires this year are in the Enterprise segment compared with 40% on average over the prior two years. As you may recall from Mark's presentation at Investor Day earlier this year, momentum in ACV growth is a product of sales capacity times productivity. We've made all of improvements in productivity. Now we're about to start to see the capacity of our sales force reaccelerate. I'm excited to be coming out the other side of our go-to-market transformation, and we expect these initiatives will deliver improving ACV momentum in the coming quarters. As I've shared with some of you, if I think about the last 15 years at Cloudflare, there's always something that I'm worried about, something that's broken or as Michelle would say, an opportunity to improve. It's always tended to be one of three things; sales, stability or shipping. I picture it serves like a hockey puck sliding around points in a triangle etched in the ice. You get good at selling a product to more demanding customers buy it. that causes whatever level of service that was acceptable before to no longer be acceptable to you focus on improving stability. And as you have demanding customers and have put in place better systems and processes to ensure stability, it starts to hamstring your ability to ship new products. At some level, my job is to live [indiscernible] so I started to worry about go-to-market a few years ago. About a year ago, it became clear that we were going to be able to bring on Mark Anderson and meaningfully up-level vaccine. Right on queue, as I stopped worrying about go-to-market, we suffered the stability in sense of last year. We focus on things and we fix them. And today, our stability, even with our broad products and more demanding customers is world-class. So I was gearing up to start worrying about shipping when ahead of schedule, I got introduced to CJ Desai, one of the most proven product and engineering leaders who is now our Chief Product and Engineering Officer. The team knows how to shift. So now I find myself in the strange position of having to look for new things to worry about in the medium term. Undoubtedly, given our ambition, we'll find new challenges, but I imparted that incredible leaders like Mark Anderson, CJ Desai, Stephanie Cohen, all of whom had incredible offers to be CEOs and other organizations believe in Cloudflare's mission and the opportunity we have to build the next iconic technology company to turn down those other offers and join our team over the last year. With that, let me turn to some customer wins in the quarter. A rapidly growing AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $7 million pool of funds contracts for Workers AI. This company signed a $500,000 contract in Q2 for Cloudflare to be their platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization and application security. They quickly recognize the value of our platform and are now moving all of their workloads over to make Cloudflare their single inference cloud platform. With Workers AI, this customer is able to improve cost efficiency with our paper inference model and also eliminate the need for a dedicated team to run and manage their infrastructure. Realizing a nearly 2 times performance improvement over traditional public clouds with Workers AI was just the cherry on top. This win is just the beginning for Workers AI. A rapidly growing technology company signed a 3.5-year $2.4 million contract for R2, Workers and Application Security. Key concerns for this customer were high egress fees, unpredictable cost spikes and vendor lock-in with a hyperscale public cloud provider, and they viewed R2 as a strategic tool to allow them to unlock paths to realize the full benefits of the cloud with cloud. With Cloudflare's Workers, R2 and Application Services all on one platform, this customer was able to increase their global application performance by 3.5x and drive down their TCO. This customer is also working closely with our product team on some exciting new developments around Workers AI. A rapidly growing operator of a large satellite Internet constellation signed a three year $4 million pool of funds contract for our full suite of FedRAMP products. Given the importance of security, performance and data sovereignty in this industry, this customer quickly looked to Cloudflare to become a strategic partner that can help them build and operationalize their design and network long term. A Fortune 100 technology company signed a two year $4.2 million contract. This customer sought resiliency on their most critical dynamic traffic, which was previously only routed through a centralized hyperscaler. With CloudFlare, they were not only able to gain greater resiliency, but also realize better performance and more robust security capabilities. We continue to see resiliency emerged as a key theme, enabling Cloudflare to establish a beachhead inside large enterprise accounts alongside incumbent providers. A Global 2000 manufacturing company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a three year $2.4 million contract for 45,000 Zero trustees, along with Magic WAN and Magic Firewall to provide secure access to more than 600 offices. Their multi-vendor incumbent architecture with a first-generation Zero Trust competitor and other on-premise vendors led to gaps in security and a lack of visibility. After evaluating several vendors, Cloudflare demonstrated a superior technical solution to their 200 use cases in addition to increasing their security posture and consolidating multiple point solutions onto a unified SaaS platform. In the words of the customer, Cloudflare's a Swiss Army knife, we can do so many things. A large technology company in Europe, expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $5.3 million contract for more than 40,000 seats of access gateway data loss prevention, along with remote grower isolation, workers and application security. With the company looking to not only enhance its security posture but also consolidate onto one platform, our innovative Zero Trust road map was a key differentiator. In the words of the customer, we are an engineering-driven company. We build most of our tech so we want something modern, effective and secure. Finally, I wanted to congratulate President Trump on his election victory and I'll also recognize Vice President, Harris for a hard-fought campaign. Both candidates were Cloudflare customers. Both were targeted by cyberattacks and I'm proud that we were able to defend them both without incident. I'm even more proud of something else. More than half of U.S. states and most of the so-called battleground states rely on Cloudflare's Athenian project where we provide free service to any official administering elections, whether they're in red, blue or purple states. We couldn't have built Cloudflare without a stable functioning political system. And key to that is making sure that you can trust the democratic process. I wanted to thank our team who've been on call for the last several months and especially over the last few weeks to come to the aid of election officials and campaigns whenever they've had a need. There will be lots of stories from the 2024 presidential election that cyberattacks won't be a meaningful part of any of them, and I'm proud that Cloudflare is part of the reason why. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. Yes. Matt, first of all, thank you for the question. I am not shy about talking about what we see or talking about macro concerns that are out there. I don't think that we see anything that is worse than in fact, I think we see an environment that maybe is ever have slightly improved. We saw real strength actually in Europe. I know a number of other companies haven't seen the same, but we executed well there and continue to see strength there. Asia has performed very well. And actually, from everything we've seen in the crystal ball, North America is -- has leveled off to slightly improved. I think we're where we have room to improve ourselves and where I'm optimistic looking forward is around our own internal execution. It has nothing to do with the macro. And the good news is that with our team in Europe, which has seen the most consistent sales productivity over the last eight quarters, I've had sales productivity increased by 22% year-over-year in Q3. They are running the playbook that we're running now in North America. There's a smaller team, so it's faster for us to be able to make those changes, but that's work. Same thing in Asia where they saw actually a sales productivity bump of 40% over the past 3 quarters. and they had the highest productivity of any region this year. So I think the macro -- I don't think there's anything about the macro that gives us more pause today than before. If anything, I think it's improving. And what I'm very optimistic about is that the places where we've already gotten through our improvement of our go-to-market team, we're seeing the benefits of that. And now we're rolling that out to our largest market, and we see that in Q1, you see a dramatic increase starting in the number of ramped reps and that gives me a lot of confidence and the consistency of the macro also allows us to invest with confidence. Yes, Andy. Thanks for the question. I'm really amazed at how quickly the AI platform that we launched is taking off and how many people are getting real value from it. And so as we mentioned, one of the leading AI companies signed a $7 million one year contract with us to move their inference to our platform. What they saw was that they were able to get significantly better performance while also being able to run at a much higher ROI on the investment that they made over what they were seeing, trying to manage it themselves through hyperscale public cloud. That's a story that is playing out over and over again. I think it's a story that is accelerating. And in order to support that, we have made the investments to increase not only just the number, but also the power of the GPUs that we're deploying around the world. What I think is unique about Cloudflare is two things. One, we are actually able to deliver inference incredibly close to where anyone is on earth because we've deployed the inference capabilities across at this point, nearly all of our network. But in addition to that, we've actually done the work to get higher utilization out of those same GPU resources where what we see when we survey customers that are trying to manage this themselves, through hyperscale public cloud is that they're getting utilization rates that are sort of in the 5% to 10% range of the resources that they're buying. We're able to deliver much higher utilization. And in the process of that, that means that we can actually pass on the effective savings to our customers. So they not only save in not having to maintain their own team to manage these virtual machines and containers, but they also save because we can just do more with the same GPU resources that are being deployed. So I'm incredibly excited that this is something which I think we have sort of started -- we're starting to shift to people who have built their models and how they actually want to deploy them in customer-facing ways. And when they do that, I think Workers AI is the most powerful platform to be able to deliver inference tasks at a global level. Yes. I'm just really honored by the caliber of people who have chosen to take the next stage of their career and bet on Michelle and my vision for the future of what Cloudflare is. And so Mark Anderson, CJ Desai, Stephanie Collin, and it goes down the list of top both managers but then also top individual contributors the caliber of talent that we get is remarkable. We're on pace to probably have over 1.5 million applicants that apply to work at Cloudflare in 2024. And we're just getting the cream of the crop of people. Those are obviously names that you all recognize. But across our entire team, I did an orientation session today, and it was just remarkable to see all of the people who are betting on Cloudflare's vision. And that gives me an enormous amount of hope that we will continue to be able to drive incredible innovation over the long term. I think CJ really brings a number of different things. One of them that I really love is his understanding and focus on the enterprise. And so, as we are building out a go-to-market team that is now able to sell very large deals to very important customers. What I referenced in my prepared remarks was that, that would then put pressure on our product and engineering team to make sure that they could deliver those enterprise-class features to satisfy what our sales team delivered. And see, there's no one in the world who is better at that than CJ. And so we're honored to have him on board. The team is incredibly excited to be working with him. And I think just watch this space because there's going to be a lot of exciting development to come. Yes. I mean, I think all of them are viable candidates for Cloudflare. And we want to make the platform support any of their needs. That doesn't mean that every application is going to make sense to run on Cloudflare. If you have a legacy application, if you're trying to run SAP HANA, we're not the right place to do that. But if you're the company that's building the thing that's going to disrupt SAP HANA, then we're absolutely the place to do that. And so if you look across the AI ecosystem, if you look across the sort of blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. If you look across anywhere where someone is able to start with a blank slate, we're seeing adoption rates in the top start-ups, top companies in those spaces that are well north of 50%, and in some cases, well north of 25% of the industry. So what we think the excitement around the platform is palpable, and it has again taken off much faster. I think our secret is that customer zero for everything that we do at Cloudflare is Cloudflare ourselves. And that's been a great formula. If we build things that our own developers want it turns out a lot of other developers want to develop the same way that Close does. And that's driving, I think, a lot of excitement and a lot of interest in the platform. I think that we're really good at figuring out how to make very complicated, hard cash distributed across our network. And so far, what we're seeing is that even in cases where there are models that maybe need more than 1 machine to run we've been able to very efficiently do the hard engineering work to split that apart in ways that often might be different than how some others are approaching it, but get a much higher level of utilization. At the core of Cloudflare, the first thing that we really did was we've built a network where we could move data faster, more reliably, more efficiently, meaning cheaper and more securely than anyone else. And that then means that we can oftentimes take an inference task, maybe the big inference task is going to take some time. It might be that we don't answer it as close to the user as possible. It might be that we spread that out across multiple different machines and then pull the answer back. And those might be on the other side of the earth in some cases. And so that network and that ability for us to utilize the entire network we have and effectively squeeze as much efficiency out and squeeze as much utilization out as possible. that's been key to what we've done across the board with CPUs, with memory, with storage, with networking and now we're running the same play with GPUs. And so, so far, there haven't been -- we have not hit limits that our engineering team hasn't found ways around. And I think that we're -- we feel pretty optimistic that even as AI continues to accelerate, the place that you're going to want to do inference is on Cloudflare's network. I think that it was -- I think that what we saw this quarter that was a little bit different as we started to see the capacity held it back at some level. And that we had had to, especially in North America cut deeper than I think we initially expected. And Mark, I think, did a great job with performance management coming in and continue to do the hard work, finding the really great people on our team and make sure that they were taken care of, but also finding people that weren't going to be up to snuff and move them off the team. What I think is the big change, though, is I think we see the inflection point for that, and we've crossed it, we're really starting in Q1 the capacity. And we know that that's going to tick up because those are people who are already on the team. They're just ramping, right? And we know what the ramp rates are. We know how that builds. The capacity starts to really tick up in Q1. And assuming we're continuing to be able to hire the plan, which we expect we'll be able to given the caliber and quality of the candidates that we get, that continues to tick up over the course of 2025. So I don't think there was something that was dramatically different. I do think that we have made the productivity gains we've seen the success in other regions, and now we're bringing that to what is our largest market, which is North America. And we see again that inflection point in the not-too-distant future. Yes. I think that I have -- we -- at Cloudflare, we always think that we're stacking different S curves one behind another. So we have older products that are in more mature markets. that are sort of at the tail end of their S curve. And those are great products, and we win a lot of deals from those. And those customers because we're best of breed in that often then adopt other parts of that. I think our -- where we're right in the sort of hockey stick growth, and we're seeing a lot of success is with our zero trust products, which are taking off. With Workers, I think that we are -- I keep thinking we're kind of in the beginning of that the S curve of growth. But before the S curve even in the beginning is steeper than I imagined and there's a lot that's there. But we are not, I would say, optimizing this as much for how do we extract the most revenue. I think we're still optimizing very much for adoption. And what I like is that oftentimes Workers becomes the conversation around how we actually adopt the entire platform because people want -- they want to sign a pool of funds deal because their developers are excited about what Workers delivers they don't know exactly how much of it they're going to use. They know that they're going to use the overall platform. But Workers has been oftentimes a place where people say, listen, I want to put this in place. I want to make sure Workers is part of that. And then oftentimes, we're finding that customers will use up their entire pool of funds well before the contract duration and oftentimes, what's driving that and just the excitement of their teams around building new tools on Workers. I guess I can take a stab at it, and then Thomas might have more. And Shaul, you're saying like financing so that they could spread payments out over a longer period of time? Or can you say more about what you -- what exactly are you thinking about -- saying about? Yes. We don't -- I mean, Thomas can add more, but we don't do any customer financing today. I think we have generally been the highest ROI provider. And because we're a SaaS service, you pay for it as you consume. I think that's often been different with hardware companies that might have a different model, but that isn't something that I'm aware of that there's a lot of demand for on our side. And Thomas, I don't know if there's anything you'd add? [Multiple Speakers] Yes. I would say I don't think that we wouldn't say things have taken longer than expected. I think that our strategy has always been to get products into the market as quickly as possible. Let people play with them and test them and use them, understand that they will be early products. And that's part of the power of having the millions of customers, tens of millions of customers that we do is that we can do that and get immediate product feedback and then iterate quickly and then use the GA process as a time to signal when it's the right time for products to be put in production used by our largest customers and have the confidence around. I think that has slowed down or accelerate. I think it's kind of always been the process that we've gone through. Some products take longer, some products take less time. Containers are already in market. We have a number of large customers that use them to do interesting things. How broadly we make that available is something that we are very much testing what I think doesn't make sense is to just release a product that doesn't have any differentiation doesn't have any advantage over existing container solutions. And so that's, I think, what we are talking to customers about. I think we're using our usual process. But Technically, there's nothing that keeps us from launching that tomorrow. I think what we want to do is make sure that when we do that it has such a compelling value proposition that it just becomes a no-brainer for people to use. Q - Timothy Horan Well, the strategy is working. Thank you. Yes. I think that public sector has been -- was really an area of strength for us in 2023. We have not -- it has not -- it continues to perform, but it hasn't I would say, been in 1 of our standout star. I think that, that is because we've been nurturing relationships, and I think that you'll see it reemerge as a real driver of growth for us going forward. But I think it has not been much of a standout as it was last year. I also -- what is -- I'm constantly reminded of is how the people who work in governments are almost by definition, mission-driven and they really appreciate the work that we do. And so the number of notes that I've gotten from very senior people across the U.S. government, thanking us for what we did around the election, making sure that any time there was a problem they knew that they could call on our team that we had people available 24 hours a day to help with any county official in any state, anywhere in the country that we're seeing some type of an attack. And I'm proud of what we've done with that. That is the most effective marketing that we can do for our public sector business. And what we find time and time again is that as we do those good works, it turns into significant deals for us going forward. And so I think that it will be a very big -- it will continue to be a big and growing part of our business. And we have the pieces in place now that there are really no roadblocks from us winning more federal business. I think we're building that sales capacity out. I think we've got some really amazing leaders there. And I think that what Mark Anderson, the person who's now leading North America for us [indiscernible], who's got an enormous sort of pedigree of selling into federal markets. And we have reps that we've hired to cover that space and they're ramping. And I think that you'll see them be able to again deliver very large deals. I don't think that we are right now capacity constrained in the federal space. Yes. I think that R2 definitely is -- the magic continues to be that if you have a large data set and you need to move it to wherever there is excess GPU capacity that R2 is an ability to do that. And so I think that, especially in training workloads, we're seeing be something that is often the gateway into using the rest of Cloudflare. And then that is helping us win more and more of the AI workloads, especially on the inference side. I think D1, there is less that's driving in the AI space directly. It is more of a traditional SQL database. But I think these components together -- have come together where now people are building full applications on top of platform workers. So you need a database, you need an object store, you need all of these primitives and these primitives together are allowing us to win much more complicated applications, much more complicated workloads, and that's important. And we continue to innovate in that space. I think what we did with HyperDrive some of the announcements we had around Birthday Week, with Durable Objects and Durable Databases are really very unique primitives that you can only get on Cloudflare. And I think you're going to start to see applications that just would have been prohibitively difficult to build in the past, especially around synchronization worldwide. A lot of game companies are starting to use some of these primitives to be able to think their player states and things that were in the past, extremely difficult to build. That is something that I think you're going to see more and more applications that just couldn't be built anywhere other than Cloudflare. And that's -- I think that's incredibly exciting for the space. Thank you. We had a number of technical difficulties. I'm not going to try and take it personally that the afterhours stock went up the most when we were mute for a period of time. But I do appreciate all of the work that goes into not just these calls but really pulling together these quarters. We've got an incredible team that just continues to execute. That team is building and ramping now. And I just want to say thank you to everyone for all of the hard work over the course of the last quarter, especially over the course of this week, where we've been all hands on deck to make sure that the U.S. election went off without cyberattacks being a big part of it. Thank you so much, and we'll see you back here again next quarter."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cloudfare Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Phil Winslow. Please go ahead.\nPhil Winslow: Thank you for joining us today to discuss Cloudflare's financial results for the second quarter of 2024. With me on the call, we have Matthew Prince, Co-Founder and CEO; Michelle Zatlyn, Co-Founder, President and COO; and Thomas Seifert, CFO. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings announcement. This announcement, as well as our supplemental financial information may be found on our Investor Relations website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements during today's discussion, including but not limited to our customers, vendors and partners, operations and future financial performance, our anticipated product launches, and the timing and market potential of those products. Our anticipated future financial and operating performance and our expectations regarding future macroeconomic conditions.

We would also like to inform you that we will be participating in the Stifel Tech Executive Summit on August 26th and the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on September 10th. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.\nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. We had a terrific quarter even with the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. We crossed $1.6 billion in annualized revenue, achieving $401 million in the second quarter, up 30% year-over-year. During the quarter, we added 168 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 3,046 large customers, also up 30% year-over-year. Revenue contribution from these large customers during the quarter remained consistent at 67%, up from 64% in the second quarter last year. Our dollar based net retention was 112%, down 3 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Our gross margin was 79%, again above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. We delivered an operating profit of $57 million, representing an operating margin of 14.2%, underscoring our commitment to operational efficiency and productivity. We generated strong free cash flow of $38.3 million during the quarter, ahead of our expectations. This wasn't an easy quarter, but we continue to execute and deliver strong results. While I think we benefit from being a must-have, not a nice to have, we still had to fight for every deal as the IT-buying environment continues to be challenging. But our investments in go-to market improvements are showing dividends. Turns out when you have the right players on the field, you can still play and win even in the rain. In the second quarter, we again delivered another double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity. In addition, close rates and sales cycles both also improved quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. I'm proud of our team's execution. I also couldn't be more pleased about the early returns from Mark Anderson and the other go-to market leaders with proven track records who have joined the team. In Q2, Mark hired a new VP of Sales in the Americas, a new VP of Revenue and Operations and a Global Head of Customer Success. These are world class go-to market executives who recognize that we have the product, engineering and go-to market leadership for them to bet their careers. As Mark continues to focus on operationalizing productivity at scale and building a world class go-to market engine, a key focus in the second quarter involved making changes to the composition of our organization and bringing on more stage-appropriate talent. This really shows in the numbers. The sales manager and AE hiring in Q2 was up 150% quarter-over-quarter and 163% year-over-year. Again, the key to the quarter was excellent execution. We expect these additions to our go-to market team to further add to our already building momentum with large enterprise customers, partners, and the public sector that we again delivered during the second quarter. That's a great segue to discuss some of our wins in the quarter. A leading Australian technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $17.5 million contract, $7.2 million of which is expansion. They started with Cloudflare back in 2016 as a free customer and today use nearly all our products spanning use cases as diverse as remote application access, worker serverless development and bot management. Over the next two years, this customer expects to transmit over 180 petabytes and 3.9 trillion requests per month and they see Cloudflare as essential to handling that level of connectivity while maintaining security. This is a great example of a land and expand customer who started with our free tier, sees the value and expands over time. Sticking down under, another leading Australian technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $2.6 million contract for 18,000 seats of gateway, access, browser isolation, CASB, DLP and also our workers' development platform. This customer evaluated Cloudflare against three leading vendors in the market and selected us due to our superior technical solution, network performance and future roadmap. The customer called us after the deal closed and said, \"you were the best solution today, but also for the future and the most strategic. We're very excited for this.\" One of the largest universities in the United States signed a five-year $5.7 million contract. This customer is going all in on Cloudflare's SASE platform with 20,000 seats of Zero Trust, CASB, DLP, email security, Magic WAN, and Magic Firewall. This university approached us looking to modernize and scale their global network as their incumbent on-premise solutions created bandwidth challenges and poor performance. With Cloudflare, they're able to replace multiple legacy vendors with a unified platform and cloud-first architecture. A large global research and development organization expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $846,000 contract for Cloudflare's SASE portfolio with 3,500 seats of access, gateway, CASB, DLP, browser isolation, and Magic WAN along with our advanced application security bundle. This was a very competitive process to displace legacy VPN providers and Cloudflare was selected over three SASE competitors due to our superior network performance, ease of use, and configuration as well as our unified platform. A Fortune 500 financial services company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $895,000 contract for Magic Transit and Magic Firewalls. Gaps in their incumbent products with two on-premise tenders left this customer vulnerable to attacks, creating significant urgency for our placement solution. A number of channel partners mentioned Cloudflare as a leader in DDoS to this customer, and we were quick to come in and get this customer fully deployed, operational, and protected in just 10 days. A Fortune 500 gaming company signed a two-year $3 million contract for advanced application security and performance along with R2 storage. This customer was looking to improve availability for its technical infrastructure to support its large global distribution of games. They are migrating all services from two incumbent vendors to Cloudflare through the completeness of our solution, our superior network performance and scale, and unified platform giving them a single control plane. A leading AI company signed a one-year $500,000 contract with Cloudflare to be their platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization, and application security. This company with an existing R2 customer, allowing them to unlock the best prices and performance across multiple cloud providers. However, doing both training and inference with a centralized hyperscale cloud created poor performance for their end users. With Cloudflare, this customer now has access to GPUs deployed across our network, close to their end users. Not only will inference task be more performant, but this customer is also realizing a 40% cost improvement with Workers AI. A leading technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $4.8 million contract. This customer is focused on growing their enterprise and FedRAMP product lines and uses Cloudflare for Government along with Cloudflare Workers to dynamically route traffic in order to optimize reliability. This customer has significantly increased their usage as they unlock new use cases and lean further into standardizing on Cloudflare wherever possible across all their business units. After signing this deal, their team reached out to express interest in our AI products. So there should be more to come from this customer. I think there are two trends that stand out across all those customer stories. First, customers are adopting Cloudflare's broader platform and signing a pool of fun deals. That can have some revenue recognition and DNR impacts, but we believe it is actually an extremely healthy sign as when customers buy into our broad platform that we know of no competitors that can match our feature set. Second, you'll notice that more and more of these large deals include Cloudflare Workers, our developer platform. Last quarter, I announced that we crossed 2 million active developers on the platform. I checked in just the other day and we're already up to more than 2.4 million active developers and over 20% increase in just the last four months. This accelerated adoption following the announcements during our developer week in early April reinforces how developers are increasingly seeing Cloudflare as offering a complete solution for them to build and ship full-stack applications. Workers AI is growing even faster with developer accounts taking advantage of our AI functions increasing 67% quarter-over-quarter. Today, we have inference-tuned GPUs live in 167 cities worldwide, making us we believe the most global cloud inference solution and inference requests powered by Cloudflare AI increased more than 700% quarter-over-quarter. Developers are turning to Cloudflare for their AI tasks that need to be fast, global, and compliant with an increasing patchwork of AI regulations. There's external validation as well. Stacked overflow recently surveyed a broad base of developers on what platforms they're using today. Cloudflare came in fourth, just off the podium ahead of 22 other developer platforms and buying only the three traditional hyperscale public clouds. What's even more exciting, however, is what the survey tells us about the future. When developers were asked what platform, they were the most excited to work on in the coming year, Cloudflare came in second ahead of AWS, Google, and Microsoft Azure. Cloudflare didn't even make the survey in 2022, so we're coming out fast. If we continue to increase developer interest at the same rate, it won't be long before we meddle. And rest assured, our team won't be satisfied with anything short of gold. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas, who looks after our gold to walk through our financial results. Thomas, take it away.\nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the second quarter as we make continuous progress on our go-to market transformation. We again delivered another double-digit year-over-year increase in sales productivity during the second quarter, and we also saw an uptick in close rates and an improvement in sales cycles. The quarter was highlighted by sustained momentum with large new customers, ongoing significant progress in the public sector, and continued high prioritization of security by our customers. Continuing our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and acting as good stewards of investors' capital, operating profit again more than doubled year-over-year and we generated free cash flow of $38.3 million during the second quarter. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 30% year-over-year to $401 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 51% of revenue and increased 28% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 32% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 29% year-over-year. We were pleased to see a notable uptick in both sequential and year-over-year growth in APAC as a number of go-to market initiatives in the region begin to deliver early returns. Turning to our customer metrics. In the second quarter, we had about 210,200 paying customers, an increase of 21% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with about 3,050 large customers, representing an increase of 30% year-over-year and an addition of 168 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 112% during the second quarter, representing a decrease of 3 percentage points sequentially. The decline in DNR was driven by slower net expansion in our larger customer cohorts, increased platform deals in the form of pool of funds contracts, which reduce friction to adoption across our product portfolio, that can impact the shape of revenue recognition as well as deferred revenue and current RPO, especially for existing customers that transition into this structure and anniversary in the price increase to our Pro and business PayGo plans last year. For the next several quarters, we expect new customers to contribute a higher percentage of our overall year-over-year revenue growth, similar to the second quarter. Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 79%, representing a decrease of 50 basis points sequentially and an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 6% of revenue in the second quarter. Based on the timing of certain investments, we expect network CapEx to increase in the second-half to reach 10% to 12% of revenue for full year 2024. Turning to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 6% year-over-year to 65% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 15% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to 3,902 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $149.5 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 37% from 41% in the same quarter last year. This decline was primarily due to the transition of our go-to market organization to focus on more stage-appropriate talent. We are encouraged by the acceleration in account executive hiring exiting the second quarter, which Matthew mentioned earlier, and we expect this trend to continue in the second-half of 2024. Research and development expenses were $65.4 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% from 17% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $44.7 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% from 13% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $57 million compared to $20.3 million in the same period last year. Second quarter operating margin was 14.2%, an increase of 760 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive, given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $69.5 million or dilutive net income per share of $0.20. We ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $38.3 million in the second quarter or 10% of revenue compared to $20 million or 6% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations or RPO came in at $1,421 million, representing an increase of 6% sequentially or 37% year-over-year. Current RPO was 69% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the third quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the second quarter, and we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $423 million to $424 million, representing an increase of 26% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $50 million to $51 million and we expect an effective tax rate of 11%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.18, assuming approximately 359 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1,657 million to $1,659 million, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $196 million to $198 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 11% for 2024. We expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.70 to $0.71, assuming approximately 358 million shares outstanding. We are currently analyzing our ability to implement certain tax planning strategies in order to manage current and future cash tax liabilities. We will provide an update once this tax planning review is completed if the outcome were to impact our expectations for Cloudflare's non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second-half of 2024. We expect free cash flow to be consistent with our implied prior guidance of approximately $160 million to $164 million for the full-year 2024. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth, and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them modernize, transform, and secure their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thank you very much, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Obviously, this is a challenging environment and to see the consistency, it's really, really great. Matthew, maybe to start with you. It was great to see another quarter of double-digit sales productivity improvements. I guess, what are some of the most important changes Mark Anderson and I guess the broader team is implementing to drive that result? And given that you said macros remain challenging, is increased productivity also help the cause of really accelerated sales cycles and improved close rates?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think we've tried to be very transparent about what we were seeing. I think the real nadir for us in sales productivity was in Q3 of 2023. And then this quarter, we're back to the same sales productivity that we saw back in mid-2022. So we're -- it is rebounding well. I think Mark Anderson gets a lot of credit for that over the last bit, but the real changes started even before Mark joined us. And I think we're starting to -- we're already seeing the benefits of the changes of just really putting in place much better operational metrics, putting in place much better training, really upleveling our team, having the discipline to do performance management and then -- and then have that flow through. And I think that's a lot of what you're seeing today. What Mark is doing is accelerating that even more. And that starts with hiring really excellent lieutenants and really excellent leaders. It's a dramatic upgrade across our entire sales organization. And then what's been just amazing to watch is great people want to follow great people. And so Mark has a huge number of amazing people who want to follow him. Those people who follow him now are bringing in and upleveling our team. And what we're seeing is not only are they more productive, but then they're helping our existing team who are really amazing people get more productive as well. So I think discipline, execution, that started before Mark Anderson. I think it's accelerating with Mark Anderson. And we have never had a product problem. We've never had a demand problem that's here. And what every sales leader who comes in says is, I just can't wait to roll up my sleeves, put in place the real discipline, and get out to selling what is an incredible product.\nMatt Hedberg: That's great. It sounds like a real flywheel effect. And maybe just a quick one for Thomas. In your prepared remarks, you noted that DNR ticked down three points sequentially. And obviously, this is a trailing 12-month metric, and you called out a number of factors that negatively impacted that metric. I guess the fact that you raised full-year revenue guidance more than the Q2 beat, does that imply DNR has bottomed, or could it see some further pressure given that you noted a larger percentage of revenue growth will come from new customers in the future?\nThomas Seifert: Yes. So as we said in my prepared remarks, the decrease was driven by solar net expansion, but it was also impacted by what Matthew described, a large pool of funds deals. So as we enter this fiscal year, we've entered into several of these pool of fund deals. They're all very large in nature, the biggest ones, anywhere between $40 million to $60 million of total contract value. As a matter of fact, four of our top 10 customers are now pool of funds customers. And these pools of fund deals are generally built monthly as compared to an upfront annual billing and they tend to have longer duration. So most of these contracts are north of three years. And as a result, the financial impact of these pool of fund deals is very different. It's very different on revenue and it's different on current RPO and it's very different on deferred revenue. And if it's an existing customer that transitions, it also impacts DNR. And so as it relates to revenue, the revenue is now recognized as the customer consumes the service. And as a result, the record revenue recognition might be non-linear and might ramp over time with respect to deferred revenue because those deals have monthly billing terms, we do not report upfront deferred revenue, and this can result then in lower deferred revenue growth. And then current RPO is also impacted because the contract duration is longer. So you recognize upfront less in current RPO. So while the deals are very beneficial and healthy to the business, and they generate some noise in this transition in our DNR and in the other metrics. So very healthy trends, will make the business a little bit more lumpy. And as of last year, I still think those KPIs are the right KPIs, but I think you have to look at them more from a rolling and average perspective but very healthy development, very large deals, but with some noise and lumpiness in the transition.\nMatt Hedberg: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon and congrats on results in what appears to be a swift action by Mark and the entire team. Matthew, given the recent CrowdStrike ID outage, which was on-premise predominantly. My question is whether Cloudflare was called by some customers to assist given your cloud connectivity capabilities and focus and whether you could be seeing some longer-term benefit given this focus? And I have a follow-up.\nMark Anderson: Yes, Shaul. I think we get called to help customers all the time, but we don't have a product that directly competes or replaces CrowdStrike. I think the first thing I'd say is that our whole team, we offered to help CrowdStrike directly in any way that we could, helping them get patches out or leases out, helping review any communications that they had. And they have been a great partner. We are a customer of theirs and we continue to have faith in their product and George and the rest of his leadership team. I think more generally though, the word of the day is going to be resilience, which is that customers are going to want to make sure that they are not sole-sourced on any one vendor and that includes with vendors like the ones that are providing network security like we do at Cloudflare. And so when we're talking to large financial institutions, what they're saying to us is, we want to use you and someone else. That I think is going to put pressure on some of the older, more legacy providers. I think for us, it actually is potentially tailwind for us because in places where before we had to convince someone to rip and replace, now instead, we just have to say you need to have a second provider in place. And since we have been the disruptor in the market moving from the low-end up and increasingly going into larger enterprises. I think it actually opens up more and more opportunity for us over time. So what I'm hearing from customers is that resilience is key that people are increasingly not wanting to be entirely reliant on any one vendor. And I think that especially in the larger accounts that we're going after, that is actually going to open up an opportunity for us to get in because it means we can sit side-by-side with someone else. What's great though is our performance is better, our security is better and we know time and time and time again if you put us next to anyone else in the CASB space, anybody else in the SASE space, anyone else that these vendors are looking at, we may start out as the number two vendor, but very quickly, they realize that we should be number one.\nShaul Eyal: Understood. And I was listening carefully to your prepared remarks as it relates to the product, seems as if you're hitting on all cylinders Magic Translate, Virtual Firewall, SASE workers, RTU, you name it. But the question is whether there was any specific one or two product services that stood out specifically this quarter?\nMatthew Prince: I think the first thing I'd say is that -- and this really echoes what Thomas was just talking about, when we say that people are signing up for pool of funds deals, what they are really signing up for is to use the entire Cloudflare platform. And so more and more, we're seeing that people are saying, I'm not picking you for one feature or another. I'm picking it because the entire platform gives me a solution to all of my network performance, security, and reliability needs. And so I think that that's what's driving a lot of our larger deals with our larger customers. And I think that's an incredibly encouraging result. If you force me to pick one area that's really standing out, it's got to be the developer platform. I was blown away that just quarter-over-quarter, we've seen a 20% increase in active developer accounts. That is especially showing up in the Workers AI platform, we've been able to partner with folks like Meta to be able to get the latest versions of Lama out on our platform and developers are just flocking to it. And so I think that if you look around in our developer channels, our discord channel, if you look around on Twitter, you'll see that more and more developers are betting the future of whatever their application is on the Workers platform and they found that they can use us and us alone to build future applications, which again, every day I get a new report from our team just saying you won't believe what somebody built on Cloudflare Workers. So if you force me to pick one thing, I'm going to say Workers was the real standout of the quarter, but generally, it's been the platform.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Well done.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Look, I know it's not a metric you guys completely focused in on, but it was the largest net customer additions I think you guys have had as a public company in aggregate. And so Matthew, you've had a phenomenal track-record of really calling out IT spending trends and you did say some tightness still. And so my question really is, how are customers balancing this tightness with sort of that potential total cost of ownership savings by moving on to a Cloudflare versus kind of new projects? And how are you kind of thinking this could change in terms of IT spending, if at all in the second-half as budgets begin to be set later this year for next year actually?\nMatthew Prince: Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Thomas might have something else to add. So I do think that it continues to be a challenging IT-buying environment, and this was by no means an easy quarter. I'm proud of our team and execution was really, really the name of the game here. And I think that, that increased execution will pay dividends even as the IT environment inevitably does rebound over time. But that -- our crystal ball still shows that it's challenging sledding for the overall IT environment over the quarters ahead. I do think that we benefit by being something that companies must have. While IT budgets might be getting cut in marketing tech, in productivity tech and in other spaces. I think security is one of the areas and we've had so many high-profile security incidents over the first-half of this year. The security is an area where people are continuing to invest. But what I think is really powerful about Cloudflare is we don't just solve one security need. We solve the totality of a customer's security needs. And so oftentimes, when a customer is signing one of these pool of fund deals, they're replacing two, three, four different vendors and consolidating behind Cloudflare. And so I think that what we see over time is that the network security space is the area that we want to own soup to nuts and that we can completely have that as a solution for customers. And in times where IT budgets are tough, that is a place where people want to consolidate. They want to consolidate on a single vendor, and we are a beneficiary of that.\nThomas Seifert: Can you guys -- quick?\nJim Fish: Go ahead, Thomas.\nThomas Seifert: Yes. I just wanted to add to your introduction, but it was a very strong net customer at quarter and mainly driven by three effects. So we had a one-time benefit because we migrated billing platforms and there was a catch up. But beyond that one-time benefit, it was a very strong net customer at quarter driven by our two-customer increase, up 32% at quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter, as well as the increase in developers on their Workers platform that Matthew talked about. So those three factors were driving the comp. So very strong quarter.\nJim Fish: Makes sense. And you guys obviously pool of funds is another theme of this quarter. And Thomas, you had just said a few moments ago, I believe that it was 4 of the top 10 customers are now on this type of contract. So is there a way to understand how much of RPO is now on this sort of pool of funds path as even just those four at that kind of 50-ish million average rate would imply about 15% of RPO today? And additionally, what could that look like kind of a few years down the road?\nThomas Seifert: Well, I will not give you that kind of information. But what you just said, I think is a good indication. We've always been asked how we drive customer revenue up and how you can get to $3 digit million ACVs and TCVs. Pool of funds will be that path and then Matthew outlined the reasons for that. In addition to the pool of fund deals and in the second quarter, we also entered into a handful of very large subscription arrangements, all well north of $5 million. And those are more predictable from a revenue recognition and forecasting perspective, but they have very similar impacts on RPO and deferred revenue. So in addition to the pool of fund structure impacting us generating this lumpiness in the quarter, and we were also successful signing very large subscription arrangements in the second quarter too.\nJim Fish: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay, good afternoon. Congrats on another amazing quarter. So I wanted to ask a bit of a techy question to start here as it relates to your Edge AI and your OHTTP offering. Now, I know you're one of the co-founders of OHTP, but I was wondering if you could comment on how your customers might be using it as a way to preserve data privacy and maybe give us an idea on the revenue opportunity there?\nMatthew Prince: Sure. And this might -- I'm not sure how to do this and not make it a little bit geeky. But OHTTP, the original sin of the Cloud -- the original sin of the Internet is that your IP -- forget cookies, forget anything else, your IP address alone reveals a ton about who you are, where you are, and a bunch -- and a bunch of other things. Your IP address in your home, for instance, doesn't change all that often. And so even without cookies, even without anything else, people can build profiles of you. As privacy has become more and more important as we -- as -- and then recognized as being more and more important online. I think one of the things that our team with a number of other industry partners and leaders has really focused on is how can we eliminate that original sin, how can we disassociate your IP address from your identity. And so OHTTP is a technology that does it. The best way to think about it's essentially two hops in the system. So if your device connects to the first proxy that is out there, that proxy knows what device connected to it. But then it can use encryption to wrap that identity piece up almost like putting it in an envelope and handing it off to a second proxy and that second proxy is the only thing that knows where that traffic is going. So one party can know who is behind something and the other party can know where they're going, but neither party knows both where any one individual is going. So you can imagine in the case of like a handset manufacturer, they may operate that first proxy because they operate the handsets themselves, but then hand that off to a third-party like Cloudflare in order to never have the information about where their customers go online. I think that what's interesting about this is that the very nature of the protocol requires an independent third-party. So at no point can the handset manufacturers say we're going to complete the soup to nuts. They have to have an independent third-party. And the third-party of choice in this, I think in large part because privacy has been so core to who Cloudflare is and what we do. It's one of our five core values in terms of when we think about products. And because of just our breadth and technical expertise, as more and more companies are thinking about this and recognizing that both for philosophical reasons, but then also for regulatory reasons that they need to be as private as possible, Cloudflare is that preferred place to be that second hop in an OHTTP solution. So I have been -- I think we built this for some very specific and I would have thought relatively limited use cases. I am surprised how many different use cases this is now getting introduced into. And I think that as AI continues to develop, it's an area where a lot of people are rethinking the privacy of the Internet and thinking about how can they incorporate more modern standards. And to that extent, I think you will see that if there is continued growth in this space, it actually may be a lot of the AI companies that are leading in that direction.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. That was really helpful. Maybe a question for Thomas as well, just really impressive operating leverage in the model and a strong guide for the year. I know you're not giving fiscal '25 guidance yet, but given the substantial raise to your operating margin for this year, I was wondering if you could at least tell us how you're thinking about operating leverage next year and whether you'd expect operating margin expansion above the new guidance you gave for this year? Thanks.\nThomas Seifert: Yes, nice try, but I'm not going to give guidance for next year. But I think over the years, we have been good stewards of investors' capital, and this will continue. And we, Matthew and Michelle described how the philosophy -- how we run the business really well in this long -- as we see a market that is this large in terms of TAM that we can disrupt and deliver strong growth rates, investment into Cloudflare is the best return for the money that we earn. And keeping this balance in terms of how we think about the business of growth rate and operating leverage, I think served us well and we'll continue, will not deviate from this philosophy in next year, but I will shy away from giving you guidance.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay, thanks. Keep up the good work, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Borg: Awesome, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just building off the last question a little bit and even tying it back to some of the wins you talked earlier on AI. How do you think about the inference opportunity overall when you think about hyperscale clouds, obviously, the Edge network that you've built as well as the Edge device themselves, how do you think about how that relationship looks like today and how that evolves over time?\nMatthew Prince: Yes, Adam, my take is that inference is primarily going to happen in two places. The first is on devices themselves. And that you can already see what a number of handset manufacturers and others are doing to bring more powerful GPUs and TPUs directly to devices. And my rough hand wavy, I have no idea if it will be right, but just as a mental model is that maybe 50% of inference tasks get handled on your device. But there will always be either devices which are older and maybe don't have the latest chips on them or models that are bigger and require more compute power than your handheld or device is able to deliver. And in those cases, you're going to hand that inference task off to something else. One model of that is to send that back to Ashburn, Virginia, or some centralized sort of traditional public cloud. I think that, especially because of the concerns around privacy, because of the regulatory concerns where AI is getting just rapidly regulated that you're going to want to keep that as close as possible. That also has the benefit of making it as performant as possible. And it also means that you can have the AI that's responding, have regional differences more easily so that if you're responding in the UK and the NAI can spell color with a U, whereas if it's in the U.S., it can spell it with no U. I think all of those things then drive a lot of the other 50% of inference tasks to be running at a network like Cloudflare. And so we are trying to build that network out ahead, make sure that we can answer any inference task that can't get determined on your own device as close as possible to that device, and then make it very easy to get that inference task from us or from the device to us in a standards based API-driven way so that is seamless to that end user. There will still be some tasks that maybe will be even too big to run at us, although that is becoming a smaller and smaller list of tasks and maybe there's some small percent that makes its way back to a traditional hyperscale public cloud. But I really think that inference is going to be between the end devices themselves and a network that is like Cloudflare that spans the globe and is incredibly close in every jurisdiction where end users might be.\nAdam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Please go ahead.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Matthew and Thomas, this is for you both. I had a bigger picture question around the pricing strategy across the portfolio. So at a tactical level, you had some meaningful price increases that -- your first ones ever. Thomas, wondering if you could just opine on how far deep those have pervaded the installed base and if you can kind of talk to where we are in terms of the innings, in terms of how that unfurled in the base? And then, Matthew , the bigger picture question for you is if I piece together a lot of what you shared in the prepared remarks as it relates to pool of fund deals, more pay-as-you-go, more consumption payment modalities, especially as the Workers portfolio scales, how should we generally think about the business impact and sort of revenue elasticity, if you will? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: I'll start and then Thomas can add. And I think we might both have something to say on both pieces. So we're about a year after a price increase across our pay-as-you-go business. That is a -- it's an important part of our business, but it is a relatively small part of our business. I think we -- for a long-time we're very reluctant to raise prices on that part of the business, but we had added so much value that we just thought that it was the right thing to do. And we were really incredibly pleasantly surprised how many of the customers, the pay-as-you-go customers not only didn't -- turn rates were tiny, due to that price increase but really -- actually wrote to us and said about time because there's so much more value that you've added. And that was -- it was good. Price increases didn't apply across the rest of the platform. So enterprise customers, all the customers we talked about on these calls, there wasn't any dramatic price increase there. I think we are always trying to find ways to have the highest ROI for our large customers. And typically, we can be a substantial saving over whatever the existing vendors are in the market. And because we have the efficiency in our business, we can do that while still maintaining 78%, 79% gross margins. Our long-term target gross margins are 75% to 77% and we've been coming in ahead of that. And again, very healthy software-like gross margins even for our business with the operational complexity and intensity that we have. And I think that's what allowed us to be -- to deliver the returns that we can. Generally, I think philosophically, what we want to do is be the network for all of our customers and we want to solve all of the problems that a customer has around their network. And so we think of it as being their connectivity cloud and that connectivity cloud works great with whatever devices and things they have on-premise, works great with whatever they're running in a traditional hyperscale public cloud, but we're that connectivity layer that sits between those things. And that's a very, very, very substantial opportunity. And one that I think we have only just started to really, really penetrate.\nFatima Boolani: I appreciate that.\nThomas Seifert: There's not much to add to what Matthew just said. Some of the impacts of this transition you have seen, we talked about how pool of funds deal impacts the lumpiness or make our numbers a little bit more lumpy and we will also have an increasingly higher share of variable revenue in our numbers, while this number is still small today, it will grow meaningful over time. But this is less driven by price increases as Matthew said, but it's more driven by the structural changes that this transition implies and with all the overall benefits of more stickiness, longer duration deals, platform deals with better expansion capability and significantly higher total contract values.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nHamza Fodderwala: All right. Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. Matthew, I just had one question on public sector for you. We saw a lot of strong momentum in the public sector space and the federal space over the last year. I'm curious, as we head into the federal fiscal year close, in September, what that momentum has been like, especially ahead of what's going to be an election in November? What are you hearing from the agency customers that you work with? Thank you.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. So federal has been a real point of strength for us ever since we started investing in it. And ever since we achieved FedRAMP certification, which really unlocked a lot of U.S. federal business, but we've seen also strong government business around the world. I would say first of all, the election is incredibly important. We couldn't have built Cloudflare without a stable functioning democracy and you can't have stable functioning democracies unless you have elections that people can trust. And so since 2016, actually directly in response to the -- a lot of mistrust and tampering in the 2016 election, we launched what we call the Athenian project where we provide our services at no cost to anyone who is helping administer an election around the world and in -- or excuse me, around the United States, although we've increasingly started doing it in select countries around the world as well. And I'm incredibly proud of the work that we do on this to help support what are largely unsung heroes, I don't care if it's a red state or a blue state or a purple state, like if you're helping administer an election in some county around the United States, you're a real patriot and a real hero and you need all the help and protection that we can give. And I'm proud of the fact that our team on a pro bono basis provides the full suite of our services to the people who are administering elections because I think it's fundamental for the success of our country and our country is fundamental to the success of the company. So I'm not sure that the election itself drives significant upticks in spending. And I feel kind of a little gross if it did because I think it's our duty to provide our services in these cases. What I will say is that I think most of the people who are listening in on this call would say that it's not always the most rational thing to go work for government, certainly doesn't pay the best that's out there. But I think what government -- with government officials that I've talked to, the public servants that I've talked to, again, across the political spectrum, what they all are is very mission-driven and they believe in the mission of -- in the United States of this country and the importance of that. And I think that they very much respect when they see companies like Cloudflare step up and say, it's not just all about how we collect the most revenue, but it's how we do the right thing to protect the underlying function of democracy. And so when you hear about us winning big deals that are big numbers and large revenue producing deals, I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we are thought of extremely well by those incredibly patriotic, very mission-driven people who are public servants. And when they're thinking about when they have a hard problem that they are going to pick a vendor for, who they turn to, the work that we do on things like the Athenian project and protecting elections is part of why we've had the momentum and the success that we've had with the federal business. And I think that will continue and only accelerate over the quarters and years to come.\nHamza Fodderwala: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh of JMP. Please go ahead.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one question for me, but I need a couple of parts. Matthew, you had a good win story that you had in your prepared remarks, I think it was with the Australian tech company SASE deal where they had also purchased Workers. Curious how much you're leaning into those SASE deals where an Act 3 product such as Workers is kind of coming into the fold and how kind of important of a differentiator you see that within that particular market? And then as a follow-up, you had your descaler campaign last year to kind of handle or campaign against one particular competitor in that space. Just curious if you're seeing that overall competitive landscape shift at all kind of in the last 12 months and if we might see a similar campaign against another competitor there? Just maybe just get your overall thoughts about who you're seeing in the deals and if there's other players kind of coming up from different parts of the market that are not the standard ones that you've come up in the past? Thanks.\nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that the thing that we can do that's very difficult for any point solution vendor to compete with is to provide a comprehensive solution. And so you -- again, if the theme is pool of funds, platform deals, broad deals, Workers is a part of that. It is quite not as big of a part as our traditional application security. If you -- it doesn't make any sense if you're going to do a SASE deal to not have the same vendor also providing your DDoS mitigation and we're really the only vendor in the space that can do both the traffic coming into your network and the traffic going out from your network. But it's just a network, like the network should be smart, and that should be -- you should provide one kind of holistic solution. I don't know yet of any real vendors where people have said, oh, I'm or any real customers where people have said, I'm going to choose your SASE solution because of Workers. There are places where people are using Workers and then they use our SASE solution, and those things go together. But I think you'll start to see more of that going forward. The really powerful thing comes back to sort of the origin story of Workers itself. We didn't build Workers to sell it as a developer platform. We built it because we saw all of these opportunities and we needed to develop a platform for our internal team, customer zero to be able to build different solutions. What's powerful about that is that -- that then means that same platform can be used to adapt, configure, or customize any of the solutions that are built on Workers, more so than you can with any other vendor that's out there because you're using that same developer platform. I don't think that's -- I don't think we're there yet in terms of customers. I think we're still in the kind of just get it up and running stage. And not just us, I think across the entire space, SASE is a new enough category. But over time, I think when people go from saying, first of all, I want to secure network. Secondly, I want to make sure it's reliable. Third, I want to make sure that it is fast, it's performant. I think the next thing that people come to is, I want to make sure it's programmable. I think we are still kind of in the secure and reliable stage. I think customers are coming to us away from some of the first-generation Zero-Trust and SASE vendors because we are secure, reliable, and fast. But over time, secure, reliable, fast, and programmable is a pretty killer combination that I don't think there's any other vendor out there that's going to be able to match.\nTrevor Walsh: Great. I appreciate the perspective. Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Matthew Prince for closing remarks.\nMatthew Prince: Just wanted to say thank you to the entire Cloudflare team. This quarter really the theme was execution and you guys executed incredibly well. Thank you to the team. Thank you to all of our customers. It continues to be a complicated world out there, but Cloudflare is helping better secure networks everywhere around the world. Thank you all. See you back here next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes, Shaul. I think we get called to help customers all the time, but we don't have a product that directly competes or replaces CrowdStrike. I think the first thing I'd say is that our whole team, we offered to help CrowdStrike directly in any way that we could, helping them get patches out or leases out, helping review any communications that they had. And they have been a great partner. We are a customer of theirs and we continue to have faith in their product and George and the rest of his leadership team. I think more generally though, the word of the day is going to be resilience, which is that customers are going to want to make sure that they are not sole-sourced on any one vendor and that includes with vendors like the ones that are providing network security like we do at Cloudflare. And so when we're talking to large financial institutions, what they're saying to us is, we want to use you and someone else. That I think is going to put pressure on some of the older, more legacy providers. I think for us, it actually is potentially tailwind for us because in places where before we had to convince someone to rip and replace, now instead, we just have to say you need to have a second provider in place. And since we have been the disruptor in the market moving from the low-end up and increasingly going into larger enterprises. I think it actually opens up more and more opportunity for us over time. So what I'm hearing from customers is that resilience is key that people are increasingly not wanting to be entirely reliant on any one vendor. And I think that especially in the larger accounts that we're going after, that is actually going to open up an opportunity for us to get in because it means we can sit side-by-side with someone else. What's great though is our performance is better, our security is better and we know time and time and time again if you put us next to anyone else in the CASB space, anybody else in the SASE space, anyone else that these vendors are looking at, we may start out as the number two vendor, but very quickly, they realize that we should be number one."

            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the second quarter as we make continuous progress on our go-to market transformation. We again delivered another double-digit year-over-year increase in sales productivity during the second quarter, and we also saw an uptick in close rates and an improvement in sales cycles. The quarter was highlighted by sustained momentum with large new customers, ongoing significant progress in the public sector, and continued high prioritization of security by our customers. Continuing our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and acting as good stewards of investors' capital, operating profit again more than doubled year-over-year and we generated free cash flow of $38.3 million during the second quarter. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 30% year-over-year to $401 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 51% of revenue and increased 28% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 32% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 29% year-over-year. We were pleased to see a notable uptick in both sequential and year-over-year growth in APAC as a number of go-to market initiatives in the region begin to deliver early returns. Turning to our customer metrics. In the second quarter, we had about 210,200 paying customers, an increase of 21% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with about 3,050 large customers, representing an increase of 30% year-over-year and an addition of 168 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 112% during the second quarter, representing a decrease of 3 percentage points sequentially. The decline in DNR was driven by slower net expansion in our larger customer cohorts, increased platform deals in the form of pool of funds contracts, which reduce friction to adoption across our product portfolio, that can impact the shape of revenue recognition as well as deferred revenue and current RPO, especially for existing customers that transition into this structure and anniversary in the price increase to our Pro and business PayGo plans last year. For the next several quarters, we expect new customers to contribute a higher percentage of our overall year-over-year revenue growth, similar to the second quarter. Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 79%, representing a decrease of 50 basis points sequentially and an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 6% of revenue in the second quarter. Based on the timing of certain investments, we expect network CapEx to increase in the second-half to reach 10% to 12% of revenue for full year 2024. Turning to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 6% year-over-year to 65% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 15% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to 3,902 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $149.5 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 37% from 41% in the same quarter last year. This decline was primarily due to the transition of our go-to market organization to focus on more stage-appropriate talent. We are encouraged by the acceleration in account executive hiring exiting the second quarter, which Matthew mentioned earlier, and we expect this trend to continue in the second-half of 2024. Research and development expenses were $65.4 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% from 17% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $44.7 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% from 13% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $57 million compared to $20.3 million in the same period last year. Second quarter operating margin was 14.2%, an increase of 760 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive, given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $69.5 million or dilutive net income per share of $0.20. We ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $38.3 million in the second quarter or 10% of revenue compared to $20 million or 6% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations or RPO came in at $1,421 million, representing an increase of 6% sequentially or 37% year-over-year. Current RPO was 69% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the third quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the second quarter, and we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $423 million to $424 million, representing an increase of 26% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $50 million to $51 million and we expect an effective tax rate of 11%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.18, assuming approximately 359 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1,657 million to $1,659 million, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $196 million to $198 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 11% for 2024. We expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.70 to $0.71, assuming approximately 358 million shares outstanding. We are currently analyzing our ability to implement certain tax planning strategies in order to manage current and future cash tax liabilities. We will provide an update once this tax planning review is completed if the outcome were to impact our expectations for Cloudflare's non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second-half of 2024. We expect free cash flow to be consistent with our implied prior guidance of approximately $160 million to $164 million for the full-year 2024. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth, and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them modernize, transform, and secure their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Yes. So as we said in my prepared remarks, the decrease was driven by solar net expansion, but it was also impacted by what Matthew described, a large pool of funds deals. So as we enter this fiscal year, we've entered into several of these pool of fund deals. They're all very large in nature, the biggest ones, anywhere between $40 million to $60 million of total contract value. As a matter of fact, four of our top 10 customers are now pool of funds customers. And these pools of fund deals are generally built monthly as compared to an upfront annual billing and they tend to have longer duration. So most of these contracts are north of three years. And as a result, the financial impact of these pool of fund deals is very different. It's very different on revenue and it's different on current RPO and it's very different on deferred revenue. And if it's an existing customer that transitions, it also impacts DNR. And so as it relates to revenue, the revenue is now recognized as the customer consumes the service. And as a result, the record revenue recognition might be non-linear and might ramp over time with respect to deferred revenue because those deals have monthly billing terms, we do not report upfront deferred revenue, and this can result then in lower deferred revenue growth. And then current RPO is also impacted because the contract duration is longer. So you recognize upfront less in current RPO. So while the deals are very beneficial and healthy to the business, and they generate some noise in this transition in our DNR and in the other metrics. So very healthy trends, will make the business a little bit more lumpy. And as of last year, I still think those KPIs are the right KPIs, but I think you have to look at them more from a rolling and average perspective but very healthy development, very large deals, but with some noise and lumpiness in the transition. Can you guys -- quick? Yes. I just wanted to add to your introduction, but it was a very strong net customer at quarter and mainly driven by three effects. So we had a one-time benefit because we migrated billing platforms and there was a catch up. But beyond that one-time benefit, it was a very strong net customer at quarter driven by our two-customer increase, up 32% at quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter, as well as the increase in developers on their Workers platform that Matthew talked about. So those three factors were driving the comp. So very strong quarter. Well, I will not give you that kind of information. But what you just said, I think is a good indication. We've always been asked how we drive customer revenue up and how you can get to $3 digit million ACVs and TCVs. Pool of funds will be that path and then Matthew outlined the reasons for that. In addition to the pool of fund deals and in the second quarter, we also entered into a handful of very large subscription arrangements, all well north of $5 million. And those are more predictable from a revenue recognition and forecasting perspective, but they have very similar impacts on RPO and deferred revenue. So in addition to the pool of fund structure impacting us generating this lumpiness in the quarter, and we were also successful signing very large subscription arrangements in the second quarter too. Yes, nice try, but I'm not going to give guidance for next year. But I think over the years, we have been good stewards of investors' capital, and this will continue. And we, Matthew and Michelle described how the philosophy -- how we run the business really well in this long -- as we see a market that is this large in terms of TAM that we can disrupt and deliver strong growth rates, investment into Cloudflare is the best return for the money that we earn. And keeping this balance in terms of how we think about the business of growth rate and operating leverage, I think served us well and we'll continue, will not deviate from this philosophy in next year, but I will shy away from giving you guidance. There's not much to add to what Matthew just said. Some of the impacts of this transition you have seen, we talked about how pool of funds deal impacts the lumpiness or make our numbers a little bit more lumpy and we will also have an increasingly higher share of variable revenue in our numbers, while this number is still small today, it will grow meaningful over time. But this is less driven by price increases as Matthew said, but it's more driven by the structural changes that this transition implies and with all the overall benefits of more stickiness, longer duration deals, platform deals with better expansion capability and significantly higher total contract values."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Phil. We had a terrific quarter even with the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. We crossed $1.6 billion in annualized revenue, achieving $401 million in the second quarter, up 30% year-over-year. During the quarter, we added 168 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 3,046 large customers, also up 30% year-over-year. Revenue contribution from these large customers during the quarter remained consistent at 67%, up from 64% in the second quarter last year. Our dollar based net retention was 112%, down 3 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Our gross margin was 79%, again above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. We delivered an operating profit of $57 million, representing an operating margin of 14.2%, underscoring our commitment to operational efficiency and productivity. We generated strong free cash flow of $38.3 million during the quarter, ahead of our expectations. This wasn't an easy quarter, but we continue to execute and deliver strong results. While I think we benefit from being a must-have, not a nice to have, we still had to fight for every deal as the IT-buying environment continues to be challenging. But our investments in go-to market improvements are showing dividends. Turns out when you have the right players on the field, you can still play and win even in the rain. In the second quarter, we again delivered another double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity. In addition, close rates and sales cycles both also improved quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. I'm proud of our team's execution. I also couldn't be more pleased about the early returns from Mark Anderson and the other go-to market leaders with proven track records who have joined the team. In Q2, Mark hired a new VP of Sales in the Americas, a new VP of Revenue and Operations and a Global Head of Customer Success. These are world class go-to market executives who recognize that we have the product, engineering and go-to market leadership for them to bet their careers. As Mark continues to focus on operationalizing productivity at scale and building a world class go-to market engine, a key focus in the second quarter involved making changes to the composition of our organization and bringing on more stage-appropriate talent. This really shows in the numbers. The sales manager and AE hiring in Q2 was up 150% quarter-over-quarter and 163% year-over-year. Again, the key to the quarter was excellent execution. We expect these additions to our go-to market team to further add to our already building momentum with large enterprise customers, partners, and the public sector that we again delivered during the second quarter. That's a great segue to discuss some of our wins in the quarter. A leading Australian technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $17.5 million contract, $7.2 million of which is expansion. They started with Cloudflare back in 2016 as a free customer and today use nearly all our products spanning use cases as diverse as remote application access, worker serverless development and bot management. Over the next two years, this customer expects to transmit over 180 petabytes and 3.9 trillion requests per month and they see Cloudflare as essential to handling that level of connectivity while maintaining security. This is a great example of a land and expand customer who started with our free tier, sees the value and expands over time. Sticking down under, another leading Australian technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $2.6 million contract for 18,000 seats of gateway, access, browser isolation, CASB, DLP and also our workers' development platform. This customer evaluated Cloudflare against three leading vendors in the market and selected us due to our superior technical solution, network performance and future roadmap. The customer called us after the deal closed and said, \"you were the best solution today, but also for the future and the most strategic. We're very excited for this.\" One of the largest universities in the United States signed a five-year $5.7 million contract. This customer is going all in on Cloudflare's SASE platform with 20,000 seats of Zero Trust, CASB, DLP, email security, Magic WAN, and Magic Firewall. This university approached us looking to modernize and scale their global network as their incumbent on-premise solutions created bandwidth challenges and poor performance. With Cloudflare, they're able to replace multiple legacy vendors with a unified platform and cloud-first architecture. A large global research and development organization expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $846,000 contract for Cloudflare's SASE portfolio with 3,500 seats of access, gateway, CASB, DLP, browser isolation, and Magic WAN along with our advanced application security bundle. This was a very competitive process to displace legacy VPN providers and Cloudflare was selected over three SASE competitors due to our superior network performance, ease of use, and configuration as well as our unified platform. A Fortune 500 financial services company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $895,000 contract for Magic Transit and Magic Firewalls. Gaps in their incumbent products with two on-premise tenders left this customer vulnerable to attacks, creating significant urgency for our placement solution. A number of channel partners mentioned Cloudflare as a leader in DDoS to this customer, and we were quick to come in and get this customer fully deployed, operational, and protected in just 10 days. A Fortune 500 gaming company signed a two-year $3 million contract for advanced application security and performance along with R2 storage. This customer was looking to improve availability for its technical infrastructure to support its large global distribution of games. They are migrating all services from two incumbent vendors to Cloudflare through the completeness of our solution, our superior network performance and scale, and unified platform giving them a single control plane. A leading AI company signed a one-year $500,000 contract with Cloudflare to be their platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization, and application security. This company with an existing R2 customer, allowing them to unlock the best prices and performance across multiple cloud providers. However, doing both training and inference with a centralized hyperscale cloud created poor performance for their end users. With Cloudflare, this customer now has access to GPUs deployed across our network, close to their end users. Not only will inference task be more performant, but this customer is also realizing a 40% cost improvement with Workers AI. A leading technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $4.8 million contract. This customer is focused on growing their enterprise and FedRAMP product lines and uses Cloudflare for Government along with Cloudflare Workers to dynamically route traffic in order to optimize reliability. This customer has significantly increased their usage as they unlock new use cases and lean further into standardizing on Cloudflare wherever possible across all their business units. After signing this deal, their team reached out to express interest in our AI products. So there should be more to come from this customer. I think there are two trends that stand out across all those customer stories. First, customers are adopting Cloudflare's broader platform and signing a pool of fun deals. That can have some revenue recognition and DNR impacts, but we believe it is actually an extremely healthy sign as when customers buy into our broad platform that we know of no competitors that can match our feature set. Second, you'll notice that more and more of these large deals include Cloudflare Workers, our developer platform. Last quarter, I announced that we crossed 2 million active developers on the platform. I checked in just the other day and we're already up to more than 2.4 million active developers and over 20% increase in just the last four months. This accelerated adoption following the announcements during our developer week in early April reinforces how developers are increasingly seeing Cloudflare as offering a complete solution for them to build and ship full-stack applications. Workers AI is growing even faster with developer accounts taking advantage of our AI functions increasing 67% quarter-over-quarter. Today, we have inference-tuned GPUs live in 167 cities worldwide, making us we believe the most global cloud inference solution and inference requests powered by Cloudflare AI increased more than 700% quarter-over-quarter. Developers are turning to Cloudflare for their AI tasks that need to be fast, global, and compliant with an increasing patchwork of AI regulations. There's external validation as well. Stacked overflow recently surveyed a broad base of developers on what platforms they're using today. Cloudflare came in fourth, just off the podium ahead of 22 other developer platforms and buying only the three traditional hyperscale public clouds. What's even more exciting, however, is what the survey tells us about the future. When developers were asked what platform, they were the most excited to work on in the coming year, Cloudflare came in second ahead of AWS, Google, and Microsoft Azure. Cloudflare didn't even make the survey in 2022, so we're coming out fast. If we continue to increase developer interest at the same rate, it won't be long before we meddle. And rest assured, our team won't be satisfied with anything short of gold. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas, who looks after our gold to walk through our financial results. Thomas, take it away. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think we've tried to be very transparent about what we were seeing. I think the real nadir for us in sales productivity was in Q3 of 2023. And then this quarter, we're back to the same sales productivity that we saw back in mid-2022. So we're -- it is rebounding well. I think Mark Anderson gets a lot of credit for that over the last bit, but the real changes started even before Mark joined us. And I think we're starting to -- we're already seeing the benefits of the changes of just really putting in place much better operational metrics, putting in place much better training, really upleveling our team, having the discipline to do performance management and then -- and then have that flow through. And I think that's a lot of what you're seeing today. What Mark is doing is accelerating that even more. And that starts with hiring really excellent lieutenants and really excellent leaders. It's a dramatic upgrade across our entire sales organization. And then what's been just amazing to watch is great people want to follow great people. And so Mark has a huge number of amazing people who want to follow him. Those people who follow him now are bringing in and upleveling our team. And what we're seeing is not only are they more productive, but then they're helping our existing team who are really amazing people get more productive as well. So I think discipline, execution, that started before Mark Anderson. I think it's accelerating with Mark Anderson. And we have never had a product problem. We've never had a demand problem that's here. And what every sales leader who comes in says is, I just can't wait to roll up my sleeves, put in place the real discipline, and get out to selling what is an incredible product. I think the first thing I'd say is that -- and this really echoes what Thomas was just talking about, when we say that people are signing up for pool of funds deals, what they are really signing up for is to use the entire Cloudflare platform. And so more and more, we're seeing that people are saying, I'm not picking you for one feature or another. I'm picking it because the entire platform gives me a solution to all of my network performance, security, and reliability needs. And so I think that that's what's driving a lot of our larger deals with our larger customers. And I think that's an incredibly encouraging result. If you force me to pick one area that's really standing out, it's got to be the developer platform. I was blown away that just quarter-over-quarter, we've seen a 20% increase in active developer accounts. That is especially showing up in the Workers AI platform, we've been able to partner with folks like Meta to be able to get the latest versions of Lama out on our platform and developers are just flocking to it. And so I think that if you look around in our developer channels, our discord channel, if you look around on Twitter, you'll see that more and more developers are betting the future of whatever their application is on the Workers platform and they found that they can use us and us alone to build future applications, which again, every day I get a new report from our team just saying you won't believe what somebody built on Cloudflare Workers. So if you force me to pick one thing, I'm going to say Workers was the real standout of the quarter, but generally, it's been the platform. Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Thomas might have something else to add. So I do think that it continues to be a challenging IT-buying environment, and this was by no means an easy quarter. I'm proud of our team and execution was really, really the name of the game here. And I think that, that increased execution will pay dividends even as the IT environment inevitably does rebound over time. But that -- our crystal ball still shows that it's challenging sledding for the overall IT environment over the quarters ahead. I do think that we benefit by being something that companies must have. While IT budgets might be getting cut in marketing tech, in productivity tech and in other spaces. I think security is one of the areas and we've had so many high-profile security incidents over the first-half of this year. The security is an area where people are continuing to invest. But what I think is really powerful about Cloudflare is we don't just solve one security need. We solve the totality of a customer's security needs. And so oftentimes, when a customer is signing one of these pool of fund deals, they're replacing two, three, four different vendors and consolidating behind Cloudflare. And so I think that what we see over time is that the network security space is the area that we want to own soup to nuts and that we can completely have that as a solution for customers. And in times where IT budgets are tough, that is a place where people want to consolidate. They want to consolidate on a single vendor, and we are a beneficiary of that. Sure. And this might -- I'm not sure how to do this and not make it a little bit geeky. But OHTTP, the original sin of the Cloud -- the original sin of the Internet is that your IP -- forget cookies, forget anything else, your IP address alone reveals a ton about who you are, where you are, and a bunch -- and a bunch of other things. Your IP address in your home, for instance, doesn't change all that often. And so even without cookies, even without anything else, people can build profiles of you. As privacy has become more and more important as we -- as -- and then recognized as being more and more important online. I think one of the things that our team with a number of other industry partners and leaders has really focused on is how can we eliminate that original sin, how can we disassociate your IP address from your identity. And so OHTTP is a technology that does it. The best way to think about it's essentially two hops in the system. So if your device connects to the first proxy that is out there, that proxy knows what device connected to it. But then it can use encryption to wrap that identity piece up almost like putting it in an envelope and handing it off to a second proxy and that second proxy is the only thing that knows where that traffic is going. So one party can know who is behind something and the other party can know where they're going, but neither party knows both where any one individual is going. So you can imagine in the case of like a handset manufacturer, they may operate that first proxy because they operate the handsets themselves, but then hand that off to a third-party like Cloudflare in order to never have the information about where their customers go online. I think that what's interesting about this is that the very nature of the protocol requires an independent third-party. So at no point can the handset manufacturers say we're going to complete the soup to nuts. They have to have an independent third-party. And the third-party of choice in this, I think in large part because privacy has been so core to who Cloudflare is and what we do. It's one of our five core values in terms of when we think about products. And because of just our breadth and technical expertise, as more and more companies are thinking about this and recognizing that both for philosophical reasons, but then also for regulatory reasons that they need to be as private as possible, Cloudflare is that preferred place to be that second hop in an OHTTP solution. So I have been -- I think we built this for some very specific and I would have thought relatively limited use cases. I am surprised how many different use cases this is now getting introduced into. And I think that as AI continues to develop, it's an area where a lot of people are rethinking the privacy of the Internet and thinking about how can they incorporate more modern standards. And to that extent, I think you will see that if there is continued growth in this space, it actually may be a lot of the AI companies that are leading in that direction. Yes, Adam, my take is that inference is primarily going to happen in two places. The first is on devices themselves. And that you can already see what a number of handset manufacturers and others are doing to bring more powerful GPUs and TPUs directly to devices. And my rough hand wavy, I have no idea if it will be right, but just as a mental model is that maybe 50% of inference tasks get handled on your device. But there will always be either devices which are older and maybe don't have the latest chips on them or models that are bigger and require more compute power than your handheld or device is able to deliver. And in those cases, you're going to hand that inference task off to something else. One model of that is to send that back to Ashburn, Virginia, or some centralized sort of traditional public cloud. I think that, especially because of the concerns around privacy, because of the regulatory concerns where AI is getting just rapidly regulated that you're going to want to keep that as close as possible. That also has the benefit of making it as performant as possible. And it also means that you can have the AI that's responding, have regional differences more easily so that if you're responding in the UK and the NAI can spell color with a U, whereas if it's in the U.S., it can spell it with no U. I think all of those things then drive a lot of the other 50% of inference tasks to be running at a network like Cloudflare. And so we are trying to build that network out ahead, make sure that we can answer any inference task that can't get determined on your own device as close as possible to that device, and then make it very easy to get that inference task from us or from the device to us in a standards based API-driven way so that is seamless to that end user. There will still be some tasks that maybe will be even too big to run at us, although that is becoming a smaller and smaller list of tasks and maybe there's some small percent that makes its way back to a traditional hyperscale public cloud. But I really think that inference is going to be between the end devices themselves and a network that is like Cloudflare that spans the globe and is incredibly close in every jurisdiction where end users might be. I'll start and then Thomas can add. And I think we might both have something to say on both pieces. So we're about a year after a price increase across our pay-as-you-go business. That is a -- it's an important part of our business, but it is a relatively small part of our business. I think we -- for a long-time we're very reluctant to raise prices on that part of the business, but we had added so much value that we just thought that it was the right thing to do. And we were really incredibly pleasantly surprised how many of the customers, the pay-as-you-go customers not only didn't -- turn rates were tiny, due to that price increase but really -- actually wrote to us and said about time because there's so much more value that you've added. And that was -- it was good. Price increases didn't apply across the rest of the platform. So enterprise customers, all the customers we talked about on these calls, there wasn't any dramatic price increase there. I think we are always trying to find ways to have the highest ROI for our large customers. And typically, we can be a substantial saving over whatever the existing vendors are in the market. And because we have the efficiency in our business, we can do that while still maintaining 78%, 79% gross margins. Our long-term target gross margins are 75% to 77% and we've been coming in ahead of that. And again, very healthy software-like gross margins even for our business with the operational complexity and intensity that we have. And I think that's what allowed us to be -- to deliver the returns that we can. Generally, I think philosophically, what we want to do is be the network for all of our customers and we want to solve all of the problems that a customer has around their network. And so we think of it as being their connectivity cloud and that connectivity cloud works great with whatever devices and things they have on-premise, works great with whatever they're running in a traditional hyperscale public cloud, but we're that connectivity layer that sits between those things. And that's a very, very, very substantial opportunity. And one that I think we have only just started to really, really penetrate. Yes. So federal has been a real point of strength for us ever since we started investing in it. And ever since we achieved FedRAMP certification, which really unlocked a lot of U.S. federal business, but we've seen also strong government business around the world. I would say first of all, the election is incredibly important. We couldn't have built Cloudflare without a stable functioning democracy and you can't have stable functioning democracies unless you have elections that people can trust. And so since 2016, actually directly in response to the -- a lot of mistrust and tampering in the 2016 election, we launched what we call the Athenian project where we provide our services at no cost to anyone who is helping administer an election around the world and in -- or excuse me, around the United States, although we've increasingly started doing it in select countries around the world as well. And I'm incredibly proud of the work that we do on this to help support what are largely unsung heroes, I don't care if it's a red state or a blue state or a purple state, like if you're helping administer an election in some county around the United States, you're a real patriot and a real hero and you need all the help and protection that we can give. And I'm proud of the fact that our team on a pro bono basis provides the full suite of our services to the people who are administering elections because I think it's fundamental for the success of our country and our country is fundamental to the success of the company. So I'm not sure that the election itself drives significant upticks in spending. And I feel kind of a little gross if it did because I think it's our duty to provide our services in these cases. What I will say is that I think most of the people who are listening in on this call would say that it's not always the most rational thing to go work for government, certainly doesn't pay the best that's out there. But I think what government -- with government officials that I've talked to, the public servants that I've talked to, again, across the political spectrum, what they all are is very mission-driven and they believe in the mission of -- in the United States of this country and the importance of that. And I think that they very much respect when they see companies like Cloudflare step up and say, it's not just all about how we collect the most revenue, but it's how we do the right thing to protect the underlying function of democracy. And so when you hear about us winning big deals that are big numbers and large revenue producing deals, I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we are thought of extremely well by those incredibly patriotic, very mission-driven people who are public servants. And when they're thinking about when they have a hard problem that they are going to pick a vendor for, who they turn to, the work that we do on things like the Athenian project and protecting elections is part of why we've had the momentum and the success that we've had with the federal business. And I think that will continue and only accelerate over the quarters and years to come. Yes. I think that the thing that we can do that's very difficult for any point solution vendor to compete with is to provide a comprehensive solution. And so you -- again, if the theme is pool of funds, platform deals, broad deals, Workers is a part of that. It is quite not as big of a part as our traditional application security. If you -- it doesn't make any sense if you're going to do a SASE deal to not have the same vendor also providing your DDoS mitigation and we're really the only vendor in the space that can do both the traffic coming into your network and the traffic going out from your network. But it's just a network, like the network should be smart, and that should be -- you should provide one kind of holistic solution. I don't know yet of any real vendors where people have said, oh, I'm or any real customers where people have said, I'm going to choose your SASE solution because of Workers. There are places where people are using Workers and then they use our SASE solution, and those things go together. But I think you'll start to see more of that going forward. The really powerful thing comes back to sort of the origin story of Workers itself. We didn't build Workers to sell it as a developer platform. We built it because we saw all of these opportunities and we needed to develop a platform for our internal team, customer zero to be able to build different solutions. What's powerful about that is that -- that then means that same platform can be used to adapt, configure, or customize any of the solutions that are built on Workers, more so than you can with any other vendor that's out there because you're using that same developer platform. I don't think that's -- I don't think we're there yet in terms of customers. I think we're still in the kind of just get it up and running stage. And not just us, I think across the entire space, SASE is a new enough category. But over time, I think when people go from saying, first of all, I want to secure network. Secondly, I want to make sure it's reliable. Third, I want to make sure that it is fast, it's performant. I think the next thing that people come to is, I want to make sure it's programmable. I think we are still kind of in the secure and reliable stage. I think customers are coming to us away from some of the first-generation Zero-Trust and SASE vendors because we are secure, reliable, and fast. But over time, secure, reliable, fast, and programmable is a pretty killer combination that I don't think there's any other vendor out there that's going to be able to match. Just wanted to say thank you to the entire Cloudflare team. This quarter really the theme was execution and you guys executed incredibly well. Thank you to the team. Thank you to all of our customers. It continues to be a complicated world out there, but Cloudflare is helping better secure networks everywhere around the world. Thank you all. See you back here next quarter."

A live webcast will also be accessible from our Investor Relations website. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew. \nMatthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. We had a very strong quarter. We achieved revenue of $378.6 million, up 30% year-over-year. We added 122 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 2,878 large customers, up 33% year-over-year. Revenue contribution from our large customers during the quarter increased to 67%, up from 62% in the first quarter last year. Digging into our largest customers, we added a record number of net new customers year-over-year spending more than $100,000, $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis. We are successfully moving upmarket and becoming a larger and more strategic vendor to more and more of our customers. Our dollar-based net retention held steady quarter-over-quarter at 115%. Our gross margin was 79.5%, again, above our long-term target range of 75% to 77% and up from 78.9% last quarter. We delivered operating profit of $42.4 million, representing an operating margin of 11.2%. Our gross margin and operating margin performance underscore Cloudflare's efficiency and increasing operational excellence. We again meaningfully outperformed on free cash flow, generating $35.6 million during the quarter. We have our hands firmly on the levers of our business. I'm proud of the fact that our team has been able to continue to build our network, service larger and larger customers and launch entirely new categories of products including in the AI space, while remaining disciplined with our CapEx, gross margin, operating margin and cash flow. \n We have an elegant business that works because how all the pieces fit together and leverage our hyper-efficient network infrastructure in a way that we believe no competitors can match. If I reflect back on the history of Cloudflare, it divides fairly neatly into 7-year eras. The first 7 years, 2010 to through 2017, were all about engineering and little else, figuring out if it was even possible to build the revolutionary network we have today. The next 7 were all about product, taking that incredible engineering and packaging it up. As we got greater product, we didn't stop being incredible at engineering. We continue to build on and improve that foundation. Looking forward to the next 7 years, we will continue to be the best in the world in engineering and product, but we'll add to that world-class sales and marketing. \n To that end, just 90 days ago, we announced that Mark Anderson will be joining Cloudflare as our new President of Revenue to accelerate our next phase of growth at scale. He hit the ground running and has been enthusiastically embraced by our team. I thought it made sense for Mark to say a few words on what he's seeing in his first 90 days. Mark? \nMark Anderson: Thanks, Matthew. I know Cloudflare and the team as a Board member for the last 4.5 years. But the thing that surprised me the most getting in the trenches is just how incredible the product is. I know this space, and we are leaps and bounds better than any of our competitors. What also surprised me is how much room for improvement there is for Cloudflare's go-to-market organization. The last year has been about clearing away for a world-class enterprise sales organization to emerge. We've got some great people, great experiences. And gosh, I could see the early results. I'm now planning to step on the gas, building and enabling this team that can take Cloudflare's best-of-breed products to every single enterprise everywhere in the world. I don't see anything stopping us from becoming one of the most strategic key vendors to every Fortune 500 company out there. I couldn't be more excited. \nMatthew Prince: Thanks, Mark. Some of the benefits of a world-class leader are hard to measure in the short term, but I'll give you one that can be clearly measured and that stood out to me. The number of applicants for strategic account and enterprise sales positions increased 56% in March versus February following Mark Anderson's appointment. We're definitely hiring. Across all positions, we had over 350,000 applicants in Q1, up 47% over the same quarter last year. We added several senior go-to-market leaders with proven track records in their areas of expertise, including a new Chief Partner Officer, a new Head of Global Sales and renewals and multiple regional strategic account sales leaders. If you're a sales professional who wants to win with great products and world-class leadership, the word is out, Cloudflare is the place to bet the next stage of your career. Beyond incredible hiring, our sales productivity from existing team members improved year-over-year. Sales cycles were similar to last quarter and new pipeline attainment exceeded our expectations. I don't think Mark can take credit for any of that yet, which is actually very encouraging. We have room for improvement, as he said. But now we have the right leadership and foundation to take our go-to-market efforts to the next level. I feel extremely confident and clear in the long-term opportunity that Cloudflare has in front of us. \n In the short term, however, my crystal ball is less clear. We see a lot of signals based on our privileged position running a good chunk of the Internet. Even without that visibility, if you've been watching the news at all, it's clear that the near-term outlook for the world is uncertain, increasing tensions in the Middle East, no end in sight on the Russia-Ukraine war and potential signs of instability in Asia. It's not at all certain on anything we see that things will get worse. But we do know from even recent history that macro factors can impact short-term sales trends. \n We're fortunate that we're in the cybersecurity space, perhaps one of the few sectors that can actually benefit from increased global tensions. We're already seeing that, especially in our government business, but we also want to acknowledge the risky world we live in; and b, as we always have been, prudent and careful with our investments and our forecast as we look into what is a short-term cloudy crystal ball. That served us well in the past, and I think will prove to be the disciplined approach once again going forward. The short term is uncertain, the long term is bright, and so in the medium term, we're going to keep our hands firmly on the levers of our business and thoughtfully invest in our go-to-market efforts in great engineering and in disruptive new products that deliver incredible value to our customers. That's the winning strategy, especially in uncertain times. \n Speaking of customers, let me share some great wins for the quarter. The National Cyber Security Centre, the U.K.'s technical authority for cyber threats, signed a 3-year contract with Cloudflare to deliver its protective domain name service. PDNS protects over 1,400 U.K. organizations in central government, local government, health care and emergency services from malware and cyber threats. This was a very competitive process with several vendors and a rigorous technical evaluation. We tightly collaborate with Accenture, a partner we're looking forward to working with even more closely on this landmark U.K. public sector win. A leading technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a 3-year, $40 million pool of funds contract, $8.5 million of which are expansion. \n This deal is an example of a strategic platform deal that we're increasingly seeing customers opt for with a rate card for more than 40 Cloudflare products and services. These include Cloudflare One, Magic Transit, R2 as well as Workers AI, which the customer was quick to dive in and start trialing. As a textbook land-and-expand story, this customer first came to us in 2017 for our application security services and has continued to expand over the years with this deal encompassing the vast majority of Cloudflare's platform. \n A Fortune 100 financial services company signed a similar 4-year, $10 million pool of funds deal. This customer represents our largest new logo win with a major financial institution. We successfully completed 6 different proof of concepts and the main business drivers for going with Cloudflare were resilience, the operational efficiency from a single unified platform and our ability to meet data sovereignty requirements with complete flexibility at the country level, a requirement that no other vendor was able to accommodate. We anticipate this deal will serve as a beachhead for us to win more financial service customers looking for the same benefits. \n A large international energy company signed a 5-year, $4.5 million contract. This new customer is going all in with Cloudflare's SASE platform, with 6,000 Zero Trust seats along with CASB, DLP, Browser Isolation, MAGIC WAN and Magic Firewall. Competing against a first-generation Zero Trust vendor, our focus on scalability and efficiency as well as the ability to consolidate several vendors due to the significant value in our overall portfolio were key factors delivering this win. \n A large financial institution in Latin America signed a 2-year, $1.3 million contract for Zero Trust seats for their employees and contractors, along with our application security services. This is a very competitive process with 11 participants. Cloudflare's pace of innovation, speed of deployment, superior performance and integrated platform with DDoS and WAF for agentless access set us apart from the rest. \n A leading digital marketplace signed a 3-year, $880,000 contract for Zero Trust, MAGIC WAN and application security. The company was looking to simplify, optimize and reduce latency in their security architecture and WAN platform. With their incumbent solution, this company found it difficult to roll out consistent security posture where they can manage security and network together. With Cloudflare, this customer is able to consolidate 7 incumbent products onto Cloudflare modernized network, merging network and security solutions on our unified platform with a single control plane. \n A Fortune 100 government-sponsored financial services company signed a 3-year, $3 million contract for DDoS protection with our Magic Transit, Magic Firewall and DNS firewall products. This customer was looking for a solution that was more resilient, performant and better architected than their incumbent solution. With Cloudflare's unified platform, this customer is able to improve attack mitigation outcomes on a single pane of glass and eliminate the need for dedicated teams to run and manage multiple products. Another deal with this customer is already underway. \n A leading construction company signed a 3-year, $720,000 contract for Zero Trust, Magic WAN and Magic Firewall. This customer is looking to shift from a legacy hub-and-spoke architecture, eliminating costly hardware appliances at job sites to a modern, cloud-native SASE model. Cloudflare won against the first-generation Zero Trust vendor due to our superior network, pace of innovation, ease of use and speed of deployment. \n A U.S. government agency signed a 1-year, $800,000 contract for Zero Trust, Magic WAN and R2 object storage. The agency was looking to modernize infrastructure and eliminate a complex network of multiple legacy point solution vendors. Cloudflare displaced a first-generation Zero Trust provider due to our ease of use, speed of deployment and integrated platform with a single control plane. These are all great wins. And again, I think what we're seeing is more and more customers are turning to the complete Cloudflare platform. \n Before I hand it over to Thomas, I wanted to spend a couple of minutes talking about Cloudflare Workers, our developer platform. The last few months were incredible for the entire Workers' ecosystem. First, we crossed over 2 million active developers building applications on Cloudflare Workers. Second, in April, we GA-ed a number of key products like D1, our serverless SQL database; Hyperdrive, which makes any traditional database perform like it's globally distributed; and Workers AI, which allows developers to run and tune AI models across our global network. \n We're ahead of schedule rolling out GPUs across our network and now have them running in more than 150 cities globally, making us what we believe is the most widely distributed AI cloud by a huge margin. Our next generation of servers that begin to roll out in Q2 have GPUs built in by default and will support faster inference and even larger, more complicated models. Developers are building incredible new applications using Workers AI, and we're making it increasingly easy for them. \n We added support for Python, the second most popular programming language generally and the most common language for AI applications. We rolled out our partnership with Hugging Face, making it one-click simple to deploy most of their catalog of models to Cloudflare's network. And we added other bleeding edge models, including releasing Meta's Llama-3 production simultaneously the day it was announced. \n One of my favorite aspects of my job is I feel like I get to see into the future when I talk to developers who are building on Cloudflare Workers. I'm proud that we're delivering the tools they need to build applications that are intelligent, scalable and lightning-fast around the world. Internally and externally, our innovation engine continues to fire on all cylinders. And as I said, I've never been more excited about the future for Cloudflare, the Internet and us users who will get to enjoy the benefits of all of this innovation in so many aspects of our lives. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. \nThomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the first quarter. Sales productivity improved year-over-year again this quarter. Sales cycles were similar to last quarter, and our new pipeline attainment exceeded our expectations. The quarter was highlighted by sustained momentum with large customers including our largest new logo win with a major financial institution and continued progress in the public sector, including our largest contract with a new foreign government customers. \n We're also seeing security remain a high priority for our customers given continued geopolitical uncertainty and high-profile cyberattacks, driving demand for our application and network security businesses as well as Cloudflare One. We also maintained our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and act as good stewards of investors' capital. During the first quarter, operating profit more than doubled year-over-year, and we generated strong free cash flow of $35.6 million, driven by a notable uptick in collections on our accounts receivable. \n Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter increased 30% year-over-year to $378.6 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 28% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 35% year-over-year. APAC represented 12% of revenue and increased 22% year-over-year. \n Turning to our customer metrics. In the first quarter, we had about 197,000 paying customers, representing an increase of 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with about 2,900 large customers, representing an increase of 33% year-over-year and an addition of 122 large customers in the quarter. As Matthew mentioned, we were pleased to see revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter increased again to 67% of revenue, up from 62% in the first quarter last year. We also added a record number of net new customers year-over-year across all 3 large customer cohorts, that is those spending more than $100,000, $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. \n Our dollar-based net retention rate was 115% during the first quarter and consistent sequentially. As we mentioned last quarter, there can be some variability in this metric quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to believe the prior decelerating trend in DNR is stabilizing near these levels. \n Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 79.5%, representing an increase of 60 basis points sequentially and an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 8% of revenue in the first quarter as we continue to benefit from our focus on driving great efficiency from our infrastructure and the uniqueness of our platform to onboard new workloads. We expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue in fiscal 2024. \n Turning to operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3% year-over-year to 68% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 9% year-over-year, bringing our total head count to 3,704 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $156.8 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 41% from 42% in the same quarter last year. Over the last 5 quarters, we focused on refining our go-to-market strategies and operations. We are encouraged by the double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity that we again delivered during the first quarter, which continues the upward trend from the trough of early last year from the productivity levels we consistently achieved in 2021 and early 2022. \n We expect this positive trajectory to continue based on the analysis of our pipeline and with the onboarding of Mark Anderson and the other senior go-to-market leaders Matthew referenced earlier. As you've heard us say many times, we are committed to the underlying unit economics of our business and make data-driven decisions to pace hiring. The improvement in sales productivity and other leading indicators of our business give us confidence to invest in additional go-to-market improvements and further expand sales capacity. \n As a result, we intend to accelerate head count additions in the coming quarters as compared to the first quarter. Research and development expenses were $58.7 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% from 18% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $43.2 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% from 12% in the second quarter last year. Operating income was $42.4 million compared to $19.4 million in the same period last year. First quarter operating margin was 11.2%, an increase of 450 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. \n Turning to net income on the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $58.2 million or a diluted net income of $0.16 per share. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $35.6 million in the first quarter or 9% of revenue compared to $13.9 million or 5% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $1.343 billion, representing an increase of 8% sequentially and 40% year-over-year. Current RPO was 70% of total RPO. \n Moving to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the first quarter. However, ongoing mixed macroeconomic data points and heightened geopolitical uncertainty [indiscernible] remind us that we continue to operate in a business environment that remains challenging to predict. As a result, we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024. \n For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $393.5 million to $394.5 million, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $35 million to $36 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 10%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.14, assuming approximately 360 million shares outstanding. \n For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.648 billion to $1.652 billion, representing an increase of 27% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $160 million to $164 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 10% for 2024 and we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.60 to $0.61, assuming approximately 361 million shares outstanding. We expect free cash flow to be relatively consistent with operating profit for the full year 2024, with the first half lower and the second half higher compared with operating profit. \n In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them solve some of the hardest problems that they face when modernizing, transforming and securing their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. \nMatthew Hedberg: Maybe one for Matthew first and then one for Thomas. Matthew, our checks continue to show you're becoming more relevant in SASE. Can you talk a bit more about the progress in that market and why you appear to be taking share on what it feels like a more competitive market today? \nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think we're really proud of our team for our ability to execute there. SASE, for those people who aren't as familiar with, is the forward proxy products that we sell. It helps make sure that employees who are using the Internet online are protected from malware, protected from malicious sites that the networks that you use as part of your business are as secure as possible. We were able to build our SASE platform on top of Cloudflare's existing network. And the advantage of that is that it means that you get a true platform. Not only do you get those forward proxy products, but a lot of times, we're bundling in our reverse proxy products. And that total solution is extremely compelling in the marketplace, and it's something that no other SASE vendor can match. And so I think we are a newer entrant into this space, but we've caught up very quickly. You can see we have improved more in the Gartner rankings, in the Forrester rankings than any other vendor in this space, and companies are taking notice. \n The other thing that I think everybody really loves is most security companies think that performance is sort of a nice to have, not a must have. We never accepted that. And so our SASE platform is significantly better and faster than anyone else. And so anyone who's listening to this if you're frustrated with the VPN that you have to log into, if you're frustrated with whatever service it's providing that, even if it's a new cloud service, if it's slowing you down and making it harder for you to do work, give us a call at Cloudflare because we can actually improve that and make it significantly better. And that's what we're seeing from customer after customer after customer is that our next-generation SASE platform is winning in this space. \nMatthew Hedberg: Excellent. And then maybe just a quick one for Thomas. I know calculated billings isn't a great metric for you guys based on your model, but I'm wondering how we should think about billings in the context of your expanded usage-based pricing model. \nThomas Seifert: Yes. Especially if we compare fourth quarter to this quarter, fourth quarter was a very strong quarter, both in terms of new business as well as in terms of renewal. But what made this quarter even more special from a comparability perspective, as you heard Matthew talked about some very large significant deals, both in the federal as well as in the commercial space. Some of these very large deals are pool of fund deals, and they have a very different shape to them from current RPO and billings perspective. And one indication is RPO, it's up 40% year-over-year, where you see this momentum more neutralized and some of the noise taken away. But without any doubt this business is becoming more complex. And this is then also reflected in some more noise in -- from a quarter-to-quarter perspective. But overall, we are really happy with the performance in the quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. \nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to start with a question on Workers AI because I think it's one of the most exciting products that you have in your portfolio. You mentioned Workers AI and developers are using your platform to build some new AI applications. Can you just give us some examples of maybe what those apps are and why they chose Workers AI to build on among the many other alternatives out there? \nMatthew Prince: Yes, Andrew, I -- as I said, one of the most fun parts of my job is getting to see what developers are building. So let me give you a handful of examples off the top of my head and see if any of these are interesting. You can stop me if they get boring. I think one of the largest e-commerce platforms out there is starting to use Workers AI to do image classification and generate keywords for their shops. A start-up in the drone space is taking imagery and turning it into 3D models and using Workers AI to do that. They service around the globe, and so that's interesting. A handful of the public platform companies are using Workers AI for video description, transcribing, translation, all those things as AI. A multinational online food ordering company, every once in a while, a restaurant does submit a picture for one of the dishes. And so they're actually experimenting with Workers AI to generate pictures of the food that you're serving. Hopefully, they disclosed that it's not an actual picture. \n A handful of photo and video editing platforms are using Workers AI or evaluating it in order to do image enhancement and make that better. There's a start-up that's generating songs in whatever language you speak and local languages and they're using Workers AI in order to power their song generation platform. We're thinking about a large consulting companies, public companies, the big gaming company, all of which are actually worried about Shadow AI, and so they're actually using Workers AI gateway in order to understand how their own teams are using Workers. A start-up is using a series of enterprise summarization tools where they can look at a bunch of e-mails and very quickly summarize them into executive reports. There's another start-up that's creating an AI search engine. There's a public company in the financial services space that's doing real-time fraud detection. There are people who are finding ways to -- in the renovation space, how can you imagine, before you hire a contractor, what the space is going to look like in another sense. I mean I'll just go on and on and on with example after example after example. And our team just hands these to us every day, and it's so exciting to see what people are doing in this space and the different ways that they're using it. \n In terms of why, what is it about Cloudflare that's unique? I think there are sort of 3 things that stand out to me about it. The first is just the performance of Cloudflare Workers AI because we are distributed around the world and today, over 150 locations globally, as we serve customers that serve a global audience, we can just give them a much better experience in having to ship all of your code back to some central location. \n The second is that we can actually be significantly more cost effective. If you're using one of the big hyperscale clouds in order to do any sort of AI task, it's up to you to manage efficiency. You have to make sure that you're getting the most out of the GPU that you're renting whereas what we do is much more of a serverless AI model where you only pay for the task that you actually run. So especially in a lot of the start-ups, they're finding that they can just get significant better efficiency, significant better cost if they use our platform in order to deliver that AI experience. And then the third thing is that because we got it distributed globally and because of the fact that we have such a rich ecosystem that we've built, where you can get a soup-to-nuts AI experience, that's allowing people to actually fine-tune their models. \n And so my silly example of this is that if you have an AI that's responding back to a British user and describing what something looks like versus a U.S. user, in the U.K., you want color to be spelled C-O-L-O-U-R. In the U.S., you wanted to be sell C-O-L-O-R, because we can regionally tune that. We can actually correspond all of the local and regional differences all around the world. That's something that you don't get anywhere else. And that, I think, is going to be really important for these inference tasks. They're going to want to be run locally for both the normative and experienced reasons, but also for the regulatory reasons that are out there. So I'm super excited about what we're seeing in the AI space. I'm really proud of our team for being ahead of our rollout. We had to actually physically get gear to over 150 cities worldwide. And we're still on track to, by the end of this year, we think, be able to do AI inference from nearly every location that makes up Cloudflare network. \nAndrew Nowinski: Well, that was an incredibly comprehensive answer. Maybe just a quick one for Thomas. You guys have made some great new hires beefing up your go-to-market on the channel side with Tom Evans and of course, Mark Anderson. I know you talked about the uncertain macro in the short term, but I was wondering if you're factoring in any sort of conservatism into your annual outlook for the go-to-market changes that you guys are -- might make as a reason for perhaps not raising your guidance despite the strong Q1. \nThomas Seifert: As you know, conservative is not a word that we use. When we talk about giving guidance, we tend to be thoughtful and prudent about it. And of course, it's a balance of the tailwinds we see, but also the uncertainty that is out there and every major go-to-market transformation. In our case, it's actually more an evolution. There is risk, and it's reflected in our guidance, too. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. \nBrent Thill: Matthew, on federal, the last couple of quarters, you had a theme of some pretty big wins. And I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of where you think penetration is. And is it fair to say the flywheel is spinning faster here, at least from what you guys are giving us in terms of the breadcrumbs around the federal business? \nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think federal is exciting for us. Last year, we achieved FedRAMP certification. That's opened a lot of FedRAMP -- excuse me, of federal deals to us. I think we've always had a great relationship with a lot of the members of the federal government. I think the thing, which is hard to appreciate that, as I talked to our federal customers, is how much they appreciate that when they ask us to help with something, we step up and help. So this year in the United States, obviously, is an election year, we've been running the Athenian Project since 2016, which provides our services at no cost to anyone who is helping administer an election anywhere in the United States. \n We've done similar things around the rest of the world. We've worked with the White House on a number of initiatives, including Project Safe Schools (sic) [ Project Cybersafe Schools ] in order to protect the most vulnerable schools and communities across the country. And that is all the foundation which I think has built an incredible amount of trust and an incredible amount of goodwill in the federal space. And so today, as the world is getting scarier and scarier and we're seeing more and more cyberattacks, the federal -- our federal business, I think, is being driven by the fact that we have great products, the fact that we have the certifications that are required to serve the federal government and the fact that we've built an incredible relationship as being not just a trusted vendor, but a true partner where we have helped make sure that when there's any public institution that is in true need anywhere across the country, we step up and help. And I think that's now turning into more and more business that is also generating significant revenue for us. \nBrent Thill: And then just quickly for you and Thomas, this AI CapEx war debate, you saw all the big hyperscalers take CapEx way up. How do you do this efficiently? You mentioned bringing gear to 150 cities. You're ahead in GPU rollout. Explain how you're -- is this only which way -- only one way to do with costs? Or is there a way you can do this in a more efficient way than maybe others? \nMatthew Prince: I'll start and then Thomas may have more to add. I think the thing, which is really magical about Cloudflare's business, which is really elegant, is that it all fits together so well. So for instance, as we sell more of our Zero Trust and SASE products, those are extremely high-margin products, and they don't require a significant additional amount of CapEx. That then frees up our ability to invest that CapEx in other areas, including in the AI space. I think we made some very smart decisions, specifically reserving space and the equipment that we deployed knowing that AI would be part of our story at some point in the future. And so we really wanted to make sure that's the case. That means that as we deploy CapEx, it's literally not shipping an entire server to support AI, but shipping just the GPU cards that go into existing servers that are in the field. That reduces the amount of CapEx that has to be deployed. And again, it works because it is all running on one unified network. The fact that every server across Cloudflare's entire platform is capable of performing any function that we need, that has allowed us an enormous amount of flexibility in how we can deploy things and has helped us. \n The other part is that a lot of the hyperscale players, what they're really doing is they're renting out a full GPU or a full machine, whereas our business is a little bit different. We're selling the actual work that those machines do. What that means is that we can then be much more efficient at figuring out how to allow multi-tenant use of the equipment that we have provided, and we can make sure that the utilization is extremely high. So if -- and again, these are -- I don't know the exact numbers for each of the hyperscalers and they all have different -- slightly different characteristics. But in the average hyperscaler, if they're getting maybe 20% utilization out of a CPU or GPU resources that they've deployed, we can often be many times that in terms of the utilization where in CPUs we're seeing almost 80% utilization. So that efficiency allows us to get more out of every CapEx dollar. \n Finally, I would say that inference is different than training. And so you need different resources for that. You don't need necessarily the most cutting-edge GPUs in order to do inference tasks. And so that has meant that we haven't had to chase down what is a -- GPUs that have limited quantity. It's also meant that we can be much smarter about picking and choosing between different GPU vendors and matching workloads to whoever it is that can provide the best service. And I think over time, that gives us a significant advantage over people who are just trying to rent one particular type of GPU or rent that and let their customers figure out how to be as efficient as possible. \nThomas Seifert: There's not much to add to this. We were at 8% to 9% of revenue with network CapEx in the first quarter. We said the year will be close in the range of 10 to 12, and this includes the rollout of GPU capacity pretty much to every server and every location we have. I think the -- just to underline what Matthew just said, the huge variety of use cases we see and that Matthew talked about when he talked about Workers AI deployment with developers gives us huge insight in how we optimize this capacity, and there's not one card that is good for every inference task. And this ability to optimize our investment mix in GPU capacity to that need based on the huge variety of use cases we see is, I think, an additional big factor that allows us to be so efficient with our CapEx spend. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein from Truist Securities. \nJoel Fishbein: Great execution in the quarter, 30% top line growth. Matthew, one for you and a follow-up for Thomas. Matthew, you talked a lot about hiring of go-to-market talent. And just inflecting on that, how is -- there seems to be a war on talent for AI engineers. You've seen a few companies do acqui-hires where they're just draining talent. Curious where Cloudflare is with hiring and retaining talent and if it's fitting into your normal compensation things, capacity. \nMatthew Prince: Yes. I mean I think we are very fortunate that across the board, we are seen as a place where if you want to be innovative, if you want to invent the future, or if you want to sell really incredible products or help market them or frankly, work on some of the hardest public policy issues or get to work with Thomas on the world's coolest finance team, that you -- that Cloudflare is a place where you can go. And so when you see someone like Mark Anderson, when you see someone like Stephanie Cohen, you see the engineers who are coming to Cloudflare every day. We had 350,000 people apply to work at Cloudflare in Q1 for, I don't know, 250 jobs roughly. That's extraordinary. And that is -- and that's up over what was an extraordinary Q1 of last year, up almost 50% year-over-year. So I'm -- I think that the talent war is real, but we are in a fortunate position where we are winning that war. We have not seen an uptick in any regrettable attrition. It's been -- it's -- I think we're very fortunate to be working on some of the world's hardest problems. And some of the smartest people in the world want to come and help us on this. \nJoel Fishbein: That's great. And Thomas, for you, just in terms of sales productivity, really strong improvement again. Do you expect that to change with the acceleration of new hires, sales hires? Or are you hiring more experienced people so their time to productivity is shorter? \nThomas Seifert: This is, of course, what the goal is. But even if you hire experienced people, there's a ramp-up curve that comes along with it. We are moving up market. We are getting to larger and larger customers and more strategic accounts. They're more complex. There's more overlay. So this balances itself out. We hire trade talent. We see great productivity improvement. But as I said earlier, every transformation or evolution in the go-to-market side comes with potential risk, and we try to be thoughtful when we give guidance that there might be downside implied. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. \nJonathan Ho: I just wanted to follow up on that last question and just try to better understand from a sales productivity standpoint, what inning are we in? And where do you think Mark can add the most value? \nMatthew Prince: I'll start and then Thomas can maybe add some more if he has it. I think that -- I think we are still early in the journey of being really great at Enterprise. I think in Mark's comments, he said that our product is great, but our ability to really sell to large enterprises to understand their needs and drive more of a strategic relationship is something that we are continuing to work on. That is -- I think the last 18 months were all about us sort of cleaning up the sales organization. And now with Mark on board, it's all about now how do we get the real professionals on board, where we can become that strategic vendor for literally every large company in the world. There is no large company that doesn't have a need for what it is that we sell. \n What I think is really encouraging is where we have done that, where we have really nailed that. We are becoming one1 of the largest IT vendors for those companies. And some of those are very large companies. I think the fact that we won a very large financial services organization and became a strategic vendor for them, that -- and that, as I said, is a beachhead for us to go in and take much more share. Almost all the financial -- major financial services institutions in the United States use us for something. But I want to say that we're a strategic vendor for many of them yet. We're going to be. And we can do so many things in the networking and security space that they absolutely need. And as we, I think, mature that process, it's great. I can't imagine someone who is better for this role than Mark Anderson. And again, it was not the plan when we added him to our Board 4 years ago, but he's gotten to know us over that period of time. And it's just incredible to see the high caliber of talent who is excited to lean forward and work with him going forward. \nJonathan Ho: Excellent. And just a quick follow-up. Is there something specific in the macro that's maybe causing you a little bit of pause? Anything that you can sort of point to in terms of that additional concern on the outlook. \nMatthew Prince: I think that we get a lot of signal based on where we sit on the Internet. And what I would say right now is that it's not any one thing pointing in any one clear direction. But there's a lot of noise pointing in a number of different directions that give us, I think, reason to be cautious. And I think that, that is in our very nature, is always taking as much signal being data-driven and making sure that we're making investments in a responsible way. And so I think the obvious thing is the geopolitical uncertainty around the world. That absolutely causes changes in buying behavior. \n On the other hand, some of that changes -- those changes in buying behavior have been positive for us as we're seeing, especially in our government business, pick up because of that uncertainty. So there are puts and takes that are out there. What we want to do is just make sure that we are being prudent and responsible and thoughtful as we make investments and as we think through how to handle the responsibility that we have with investors capital and that they've trusted us with. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Blakey from KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nThomas Blakey: Matt, I was wondering about the recent Nefeli acquisition around multi-cloud networking and a possible acceleration to Act 2, this prior question on Zero Trust SASE services. I guess specifically, maybe because of the impetus of the deal, maybe there was some pent-up demand that maybe this addition of multi-cloud networking technology could maybe expand Cloudflare's reach from a Zero Trust perspective, I'd love to hear your comments there. And I have a follow-up. \nMatthew Prince: Yes. We're incredibly excited to have the Nefeli team on board. We want to make it -- we think the space that Cloudflare competes in is in the networking and in the security space. And so making it very easy to get traffic on to our network to connect to any other cloud is just a critical aspect and it seemed like something that we were either going to have to build or buy. And we came across the Nefeli team in part because they came in through our own launch pad program, which is a program having customers that -- and start-ups that use Cloudflare's resources and especially our workers' platform in order to build. \n What is powerful about that is we use that same platform to build ourselves. And so when we find great teams working in a space that we think is exciting, building on the same platform, the same platform that our own team uses, that just decreases the risk of any kind of technical integration, any kind of sort of Frankenstein-ing  of your platform that's out there. And so the Nefeli team was really great, and we were excited to announce it. We think that, again, our hurdle rate for acquisitions and M&A remains very, very high. But these -- some of these small acquisitions, where we found great teams working in interesting spaces, has worked incredibly well for us. \n A couple of other examples that are very similar. Baselime that we acquired is, again, giving server observability to our platform. It's one of the #1 things that developers on our platform were looking for. And again, another time where we found someone that is using our own platform in order to build out a great observability platform there. PartyKit, which is a real-time integration service, again, it's just a natural extension of what it is that we're doing. So again, none of these are very large acquisitions, but I think they're extremely strategic. I think they accelerate our ability to get into more markets. \n And what I love is that they oftentimes are using our own existing developer platform, which means that they are just incredibly easy for us to integrate with the rest of Cloudflare and decrease the technical risk as we go with M&A. In all 3 of those cases, also, the founders and the team, they're just sort of Cloudflare-like people and they're people that we're so excited and proud to have on the team. And I think you'll hear more about the wins that we have from all those areas over the quarters to come. \nThomas Blakey: Well, that would be great to get more high-margin SASE revenue here. And I'd like to go as a segue there, back to Brent's question on GPU, and I think he gave a great question about the unique architecture of the platform and this kind of multi-tenancy. But just seeing the explosive growth with other DSPs and the approach that folks are taking there, is it fair to characterize this way that CapEx would have to go up relatively significantly if, say, a handful of these applications is being built on your platform will explode to the like of something like a copilot? \nMatthew Prince: Well, I think that what I would look at is CapEx as a percentage of revenue. And I think one of the things that's always been magical about Cloudflare has been that we've been able to invest behind the demand, not ahead of the demand. And so we're really good at rolling out more capacity wherever we need it. And so that would be an amazing problem to have. If we have to -- we -- so it may be that we, on a just pure dollars basis, end up spending more on GPUs. But as a percentage of revenue, we feel very comfortable that we can service these applications very well at the percentage of revenues that it is in our forecast going forward. \nThomas Seifert: What I would want to add here is we -- the efficiency of the architecture is really driving this. We talked about the revenue mix that allows us to invest into GPUs by more and more revenue driven by Zero Trust products. The efficiency that is driven in the hardware architecture is an additional factor that goes into this. We are in the rollout of what we call Generation 12 now of our service architecture. It's a little bit more than 25% total cost of ownership reduction in this new generation. So that is 25% more of CapEx we can deploy towards GPUs. So the levers are just not in one place, they are in many places, and the combination of this is really driving this incredible efficiency. \nThomas Blakey: That's great. Well, maybe we'll look for you breaking out AI or gen AI revenue one of these days, Thomas. \nThomas Seifert: As soon as it is the right thing to do. At the moment, I think we shouldn't get tired that the benefit in driving adoption is significantly more important than driving more revenue in the short term. This is why the efficiency is high is we see so many use cases from 2 million developers being on the platform. This far-sided approach has served us well, and we'll continue with it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. \nAlex Henderson: Great. I wanted to ask a question about your comments about the macro conditions. About 2 years ago, I think, it was you guys gave an early warning that the economy had some risks to it and that you were seeing signs of slowdown. And that actually occurred 6, 9, 12 months later. And so with this commentary on this call, are you suggesting that you're seeing similar kind of characteristics to the conditions? Or is this just a little bit more noise to it, and therefore, you're being prudent, but you just don't have any visibility to whether that's going to happen yet? Can you contrast this event to several years ago when you gave that caution? \nMatthew Prince: Yes, Alex. So I -- 2 years ago, I felt like we had a pretty clear signal that the economy was slowing down. I would say that we don't have as clear of signal today that that's the case. We -- it's -- we see things that worry us, but we also see things that give us some level of optimism. And so I think describing the crystal ball as cloudy is the right thing. What I like though is that we have a crystal ball. We can make investments and we can think through what that future looks like, in part because we just get much more signal than I think the average enterprise SaaS company gets. And I think that, that has served us well. And I think we try not to be surprising in any way. And so as we see -- I would say that there is certainly an uptick in uncertainty and sort of potential downside this quarter over last quarter. But I would not characterize it as the same concerns that I had in Q1 of '20 -- what was that, '22 where we saw what we thought was much, much clearer. So we continue to watch this. Again, I feel like I am proud of how well Thomas and the rest of the team have the ability to take that and keep their hands on the levers of our business and continue to execute. But I'm not -- I think my level of concern is not at the same level that it was in Q1 of 2022, but it is definitely heightened over a lot of what we've seen in more recent quarters. \nAlex Henderson: So if nothing is really spooking you here, I'm still struggling with the guidance and the outlook for the back half of the year. You've given guidance that -- or commentary that you're seeing significant strengthening of your pipeline. You're saying your duration is stable. You're seeing solid closure rates. You're adding more sales capacity. You're winning large customer deals at an accelerating rate. You're spending more on hiring people and productivity. And your sales force is significantly improving. Yet your guidance implies with the first quarter beat and the second quarter are above the Street, the back half is much more conservative. So I guess the question is, is that a function of specific weakness in a particular geography or due to political issues? Or is it just trying to feather in more opportunity for the sales organization to be realigned as Mark comes on and drives things because ultimately, it sounds like the mechanics imply an acceleration not a deceleration. \nMatthew Prince: Yes. Alex, I'll start and then Thomas can give a little bit more color. I would push back on your initial statement, which was that nothing spooks me. A lot spooks me right now. So just because just -- and I want to make it clear, we are in a much more uncertain environment and the signal that we're seeing is that uncertainty is up. In addition to that, I think you're correct that whenever you have a sales leadership change, there is risk that comes with it. And so there's a bit of that. But the primary factor here is that as we look at the signals in the overall macro economy, it is -- it feels like a much more -- it feels like there's much more reason to worry in Q1 than there was in Q4. But that doesn't mean that it was the same, just sound the alarm bells that we were seeing back in Q1 of 2022. \nAlex Henderson: Great. So just essentially derisked it. I appreciate it. \nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. \nTimothy Horan: We saw the hyperscale cloud revenues really accelerate this quarter, the accelerated guidance. And they're actually talking about being kind of capacity constrained. And you're kind of the on-ramp on to those cloud guys. I guess why the disconnect between what they're seeing in guidance versus what you're seeing out there right now. Particularly, you're also in like the fastest-growing segments of serverless and low latency. But I guess what's changed other than your concerns on the macro or anything on the onramp thesis? \nMatthew Prince: Yes. I think that the big thing, Tim, that I'd point to is that they tend to be purely usage-based models. And the good of usage-based models is that they react very quickly, both up and down. And so I think whereas we tend to be much more of a subscription-based model, and the good of that is that it has a lot more stability. But -- and that stability helps you when things are slowing down. So we had significantly faster growth than the hyperscalers in the last few quarters, and we're now around where they are this quarter. And so I think we are a little bit more moderated than some of the more usage-based models. And I think that explains some of it. \n I think the second thing that I'd add is that for some of the products, especially around the AI products, as Thomas said, we're really optimizing around adoption. And while we published pricing and that pricing was extremely well received, in addition to being very, very attractive for us from a margin perspective in the last months, that's something that is still not a place where we are heavily monetizing yet. But again, I think as I listed some of the examples, we see plenty of opportunity there. And we think that when we decide the time is right to turn on some of those monetization, it will help contribute to our top line growth. \nTimothy Horan: And just 2 quick follow-ups. Are you seeing any other competitors coming into what you offer on a global serverless, low-latency basis? And I guess you're implying, at some point, revenue growth should really accelerate here. I mean in a more stable macro environment or more visibility, I mean, everything we've been talking about on this call seems like, [ partners ] have said, incredibly positive. Do you -- and your guide for the second half, down to 26%, just seems like very, very low versus what it potentially could be. I guess do you think these steps will enable you to accelerate in the next couple of years? \nMatthew Prince: So on the competition front, we really don't. We think that we are in a very unique position. We don't see anybody else that is yet rolling out the type of connectivity cloud with true serverless architecture. There are people who are buying some legacy businesses. There are people who sort of talk a good game, but it turns out, when you pull the covers back, don't have very much business in this space at all. And so we are, I think, unique in the position that we're offering. \n I don't think that will stay true forever. Other people will provide services here, but we have a clear lead. We have the richest ecosystem. And I think that what's great about Cloudflare's business is that we have existing, very stable businesses that continue to perform. We have newer businesses for us like our Zero Trust and SASE businesses, which are just accelerating up the S-curve. And then we have a lot of bleeding edge opportunity with things like our Workers' platform. And so Cloudflare is all about stacking S-curves, one behind another, behind another. And so where I think a lot of companies run out of TAM, run out of market, we are able to continue to add and innovate into new areas in a way that I think we'll achieve what we want, which is we think we're going to be one of the truly iconic technology companies and we're investing for that long term, including at times making the choice of optimizing for adoption rather than trying to figure out how we make money from every single customer with every single transaction. And we think that, that's the right formula for building what is an iconic technology company over the long term. \nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Matthew Prince for some closing remarks. \nMatthew Prince: I just want to thank our entire team for executing. I know that in the world right now, there's a lot of scary things going on. There's a lot of tension, and what we do every day of making sure that the Internet continues to function, that it continues to be a force that drives the economy around the world going forward. I can't imagine anything more important to be working on. So thank you for the entire team for delivering yet another terrific quarter. We're getting back to work now, and we'll see you all again next quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Matthew. I know Cloudflare and the team as a Board member for the last 4.5 years. But the thing that surprised me the most getting in the trenches is just how incredible the product is. I know this space, and we are leaps and bounds better than any of our competitors. What also surprised me is how much room for improvement there is for Cloudflare's go-to-market organization. The last year has been about clearing away for a world-class enterprise sales organization to emerge. We've got some great people, great experiences. And gosh, I could see the early results. I'm now planning to step on the gas, building and enabling this team that can take Cloudflare's best-of-breed products to every single enterprise everywhere in the world. I don't see anything stopping us from becoming one of the most strategic key vendors to every Fortune 500 company out there. I couldn't be more excited."

            "name": "Thomas Seifert",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the first quarter. Sales productivity improved year-over-year again this quarter. Sales cycles were similar to last quarter, and our new pipeline attainment exceeded our expectations. The quarter was highlighted by sustained momentum with large customers including our largest new logo win with a major financial institution and continued progress in the public sector, including our largest contract with a new foreign government customers. \n We're also seeing security remain a high priority for our customers given continued geopolitical uncertainty and high-profile cyberattacks, driving demand for our application and network security businesses as well as Cloudflare One. We also maintained our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and act as good stewards of investors' capital. During the first quarter, operating profit more than doubled year-over-year, and we generated strong free cash flow of $35.6 million, driven by a notable uptick in collections on our accounts receivable. \n Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter increased 30% year-over-year to $378.6 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 28% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 35% year-over-year. APAC represented 12% of revenue and increased 22% year-over-year. \n Turning to our customer metrics. In the first quarter, we had about 197,000 paying customers, representing an increase of 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with about 2,900 large customers, representing an increase of 33% year-over-year and an addition of 122 large customers in the quarter. As Matthew mentioned, we were pleased to see revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter increased again to 67% of revenue, up from 62% in the first quarter last year. We also added a record number of net new customers year-over-year across all 3 large customer cohorts, that is those spending more than $100,000, $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. \n Our dollar-based net retention rate was 115% during the first quarter and consistent sequentially. As we mentioned last quarter, there can be some variability in this metric quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to believe the prior decelerating trend in DNR is stabilizing near these levels. \n Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 79.5%, representing an increase of 60 basis points sequentially and an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 8% of revenue in the first quarter as we continue to benefit from our focus on driving great efficiency from our infrastructure and the uniqueness of our platform to onboard new workloads. We expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue in fiscal 2024. \n Turning to operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3% year-over-year to 68% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 9% year-over-year, bringing our total head count to 3,704 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $156.8 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 41% from 42% in the same quarter last year. Over the last 5 quarters, we focused on refining our go-to-market strategies and operations. We are encouraged by the double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity that we again delivered during the first quarter, which continues the upward trend from the trough of early last year from the productivity levels we consistently achieved in 2021 and early 2022. \n We expect this positive trajectory to continue based on the analysis of our pipeline and with the onboarding of Mark Anderson and the other senior go-to-market leaders Matthew referenced earlier. As you've heard us say many times, we are committed to the underlying unit economics of our business and make data-driven decisions to pace hiring. The improvement in sales productivity and other leading indicators of our business give us confidence to invest in additional go-to-market improvements and further expand sales capacity. \n As a result, we intend to accelerate head count additions in the coming quarters as compared to the first quarter. Research and development expenses were $58.7 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% from 18% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $43.2 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% from 12% in the second quarter last year. Operating income was $42.4 million compared to $19.4 million in the same period last year. First quarter operating margin was 11.2%, an increase of 450 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. \n Turning to net income on the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $58.2 million or a diluted net income of $0.16 per share. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $35.6 million in the first quarter or 9% of revenue compared to $13.9 million or 5% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $1.343 billion, representing an increase of 8% sequentially and 40% year-over-year. Current RPO was 70% of total RPO. \n Moving to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the first quarter. However, ongoing mixed macroeconomic data points and heightened geopolitical uncertainty [indiscernible] remind us that we continue to operate in a business environment that remains challenging to predict. As a result, we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024. \n For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $393.5 million to $394.5 million, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $35 million to $36 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 10%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.14, assuming approximately 360 million shares outstanding. \n For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.648 billion to $1.652 billion, representing an increase of 27% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $160 million to $164 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 10% for 2024 and we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.60 to $0.61, assuming approximately 361 million shares outstanding. We expect free cash flow to be relatively consistent with operating profit for the full year 2024, with the first half lower and the second half higher compared with operating profit. \n In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them solve some of the hardest problems that they face when modernizing, transforming and securing their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. Yes. Especially if we compare fourth quarter to this quarter, fourth quarter was a very strong quarter, both in terms of new business as well as in terms of renewal. But what made this quarter even more special from a comparability perspective, as you heard Matthew talked about some very large significant deals, both in the federal as well as in the commercial space. Some of these very large deals are pool of fund deals, and they have a very different shape to them from current RPO and billings perspective. And one indication is RPO, it's up 40% year-over-year, where you see this momentum more neutralized and some of the noise taken away. But without any doubt this business is becoming more complex. And this is then also reflected in some more noise in -- from a quarter-to-quarter perspective. But overall, we are really happy with the performance in the quarter. As you know, conservative is not a word that we use. When we talk about giving guidance, we tend to be thoughtful and prudent about it. And of course, it's a balance of the tailwinds we see, but also the uncertainty that is out there and every major go-to-market transformation. In our case, it's actually more an evolution. There is risk, and it's reflected in our guidance, too. There's not much to add to this. We were at 8% to 9% of revenue with network CapEx in the first quarter. We said the year will be close in the range of 10 to 12, and this includes the rollout of GPU capacity pretty much to every server and every location we have. I think the -- just to underline what Matthew just said, the huge variety of use cases we see and that Matthew talked about when he talked about Workers AI deployment with developers gives us huge insight in how we optimize this capacity, and there's not one card that is good for every inference task. And this ability to optimize our investment mix in GPU capacity to that need based on the huge variety of use cases we see is, I think, an additional big factor that allows us to be so efficient with our CapEx spend. This is, of course, what the goal is. But even if you hire experienced people, there's a ramp-up curve that comes along with it. We are moving up market. We are getting to larger and larger customers and more strategic accounts. They're more complex. There's more overlay. So this balances itself out. We hire trade talent. We see great productivity improvement. But as I said earlier, every transformation or evolution in the go-to-market side comes with potential risk, and we try to be thoughtful when we give guidance that there might be downside implied. What I would want to add here is we -- the efficiency of the architecture is really driving this. We talked about the revenue mix that allows us to invest into GPUs by more and more revenue driven by Zero Trust products. The efficiency that is driven in the hardware architecture is an additional factor that goes into this. We are in the rollout of what we call Generation 12 now of our service architecture. It's a little bit more than 25% total cost of ownership reduction in this new generation. So that is 25% more of CapEx we can deploy towards GPUs. So the levers are just not in one place, they are in many places, and the combination of this is really driving this incredible efficiency. As soon as it is the right thing to do. At the moment, I think we shouldn't get tired that the benefit in driving adoption is significantly more important than driving more revenue in the short term. This is why the efficiency is high is we see so many use cases from 2 million developers being on the platform. This far-sided approach has served us well, and we'll continue with it."

            "name": "Matthew Prince",
            "content": "Thank you, Phil. We had a very strong quarter. We achieved revenue of $378.6 million, up 30% year-over-year. We added 122 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 2,878 large customers, up 33% year-over-year. Revenue contribution from our large customers during the quarter increased to 67%, up from 62% in the first quarter last year. Digging into our largest customers, we added a record number of net new customers year-over-year spending more than $100,000, $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis. We are successfully moving upmarket and becoming a larger and more strategic vendor to more and more of our customers. Our dollar-based net retention held steady quarter-over-quarter at 115%. Our gross margin was 79.5%, again, above our long-term target range of 75% to 77% and up from 78.9% last quarter. We delivered operating profit of $42.4 million, representing an operating margin of 11.2%. Our gross margin and operating margin performance underscore Cloudflare's efficiency and increasing operational excellence. We again meaningfully outperformed on free cash flow, generating $35.6 million during the quarter. We have our hands firmly on the levers of our business. I'm proud of the fact that our team has been able to continue to build our network, service larger and larger customers and launch entirely new categories of products including in the AI space, while remaining disciplined with our CapEx, gross margin, operating margin and cash flow. \n We have an elegant business that works because how all the pieces fit together and leverage our hyper-efficient network infrastructure in a way that we believe no competitors can match. If I reflect back on the history of Cloudflare, it divides fairly neatly into 7-year eras. The first 7 years, 2010 to through 2017, were all about engineering and little else, figuring out if it was even possible to build the revolutionary network we have today. The next 7 were all about product, taking that incredible engineering and packaging it up. As we got greater product, we didn't stop being incredible at engineering. We continue to build on and improve that foundation. Looking forward to the next 7 years, we will continue to be the best in the world in engineering and product, but we'll add to that world-class sales and marketing. \n To that end, just 90 days ago, we announced that Mark Anderson will be joining Cloudflare as our new President of Revenue to accelerate our next phase of growth at scale. He hit the ground running and has been enthusiastically embraced by our team. I thought it made sense for Mark to say a few words on what he's seeing in his first 90 days. Mark? Thanks, Mark. Some of the benefits of a world-class leader are hard to measure in the short term, but I'll give you one that can be clearly measured and that stood out to me. The number of applicants for strategic account and enterprise sales positions increased 56% in March versus February following Mark Anderson's appointment. We're definitely hiring. Across all positions, we had over 350,000 applicants in Q1, up 47% over the same quarter last year. We added several senior go-to-market leaders with proven track records in their areas of expertise, including a new Chief Partner Officer, a new Head of Global Sales and renewals and multiple regional strategic account sales leaders. If you're a sales professional who wants to win with great products and world-class leadership, the word is out, Cloudflare is the place to bet the next stage of your career. Beyond incredible hiring, our sales productivity from existing team members improved year-over-year. Sales cycles were similar to last quarter and new pipeline attainment exceeded our expectations. I don't think Mark can take credit for any of that yet, which is actually very encouraging. We have room for improvement, as he said. But now we have the right leadership and foundation to take our go-to-market efforts to the next level. I feel extremely confident and clear in the long-term opportunity that Cloudflare has in front of us. \n In the short term, however, my crystal ball is less clear. We see a lot of signals based on our privileged position running a good chunk of the Internet. Even without that visibility, if you've been watching the news at all, it's clear that the near-term outlook for the world is uncertain, increasing tensions in the Middle East, no end in sight on the Russia-Ukraine war and potential signs of instability in Asia. It's not at all certain on anything we see that things will get worse. But we do know from even recent history that macro factors can impact short-term sales trends. \n We're fortunate that we're in the cybersecurity space, perhaps one of the few sectors that can actually benefit from increased global tensions. We're already seeing that, especially in our government business, but we also want to acknowledge the risky world we live in; and b, as we always have been, prudent and careful with our investments and our forecast as we look into what is a short-term cloudy crystal ball. That served us well in the past, and I think will prove to be the disciplined approach once again going forward. The short term is uncertain, the long term is bright, and so in the medium term, we're going to keep our hands firmly on the levers of our business and thoughtfully invest in our go-to-market efforts in great engineering and in disruptive new products that deliver incredible value to our customers. That's the winning strategy, especially in uncertain times. \n Speaking of customers, let me share some great wins for the quarter. The National Cyber Security Centre, the U.K.'s technical authority for cyber threats, signed a 3-year contract with Cloudflare to deliver its protective domain name service. PDNS protects over 1,400 U.K. organizations in central government, local government, health care and emergency services from malware and cyber threats. This was a very competitive process with several vendors and a rigorous technical evaluation. We tightly collaborate with Accenture, a partner we're looking forward to working with even more closely on this landmark U.K. public sector win. A leading technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a 3-year, $40 million pool of funds contract, $8.5 million of which are expansion. \n This deal is an example of a strategic platform deal that we're increasingly seeing customers opt for with a rate card for more than 40 Cloudflare products and services. These include Cloudflare One, Magic Transit, R2 as well as Workers AI, which the customer was quick to dive in and start trialing. As a textbook land-and-expand story, this customer first came to us in 2017 for our application security services and has continued to expand over the years with this deal encompassing the vast majority of Cloudflare's platform. \n A Fortune 100 financial services company signed a similar 4-year, $10 million pool of funds deal. This customer represents our largest new logo win with a major financial institution. We successfully completed 6 different proof of concepts and the main business drivers for going with Cloudflare were resilience, the operational efficiency from a single unified platform and our ability to meet data sovereignty requirements with complete flexibility at the country level, a requirement that no other vendor was able to accommodate. We anticipate this deal will serve as a beachhead for us to win more financial service customers looking for the same benefits. \n A large international energy company signed a 5-year, $4.5 million contract. This new customer is going all in with Cloudflare's SASE platform, with 6,000 Zero Trust seats along with CASB, DLP, Browser Isolation, MAGIC WAN and Magic Firewall. Competing against a first-generation Zero Trust vendor, our focus on scalability and efficiency as well as the ability to consolidate several vendors due to the significant value in our overall portfolio were key factors delivering this win. \n A large financial institution in Latin America signed a 2-year, $1.3 million contract for Zero Trust seats for their employees and contractors, along with our application security services. This is a very competitive process with 11 participants. Cloudflare's pace of innovation, speed of deployment, superior performance and integrated platform with DDoS and WAF for agentless access set us apart from the rest. \n A leading digital marketplace signed a 3-year, $880,000 contract for Zero Trust, MAGIC WAN and application security. The company was looking to simplify, optimize and reduce latency in their security architecture and WAN platform. With their incumbent solution, this company found it difficult to roll out consistent security posture where they can manage security and network together. With Cloudflare, this customer is able to consolidate 7 incumbent products onto Cloudflare modernized network, merging network and security solutions on our unified platform with a single control plane. \n A Fortune 100 government-sponsored financial services company signed a 3-year, $3 million contract for DDoS protection with our Magic Transit, Magic Firewall and DNS firewall products. This customer was looking for a solution that was more resilient, performant and better architected than their incumbent solution. With Cloudflare's unified platform, this customer is able to improve attack mitigation outcomes on a single pane of glass and eliminate the need for dedicated teams to run and manage multiple products. Another deal with this customer is already underway. \n A leading construction company signed a 3-year, $720,000 contract for Zero Trust, Magic WAN and Magic Firewall. This customer is looking to shift from a legacy hub-and-spoke architecture, eliminating costly hardware appliances at job sites to a modern, cloud-native SASE model. Cloudflare won against the first-generation Zero Trust vendor due to our superior network, pace of innovation, ease of use and speed of deployment. \n A U.S. government agency signed a 1-year, $800,000 contract for Zero Trust, Magic WAN and R2 object storage. The agency was looking to modernize infrastructure and eliminate a complex network of multiple legacy point solution vendors. Cloudflare displaced a first-generation Zero Trust provider due to our ease of use, speed of deployment and integrated platform with a single control plane. These are all great wins. And again, I think what we're seeing is more and more customers are turning to the complete Cloudflare platform. \n Before I hand it over to Thomas, I wanted to spend a couple of minutes talking about Cloudflare Workers, our developer platform. The last few months were incredible for the entire Workers' ecosystem. First, we crossed over 2 million active developers building applications on Cloudflare Workers. Second, in April, we GA-ed a number of key products like D1, our serverless SQL database; Hyperdrive, which makes any traditional database perform like it's globally distributed; and Workers AI, which allows developers to run and tune AI models across our global network. \n We're ahead of schedule rolling out GPUs across our network and now have them running in more than 150 cities globally, making us what we believe is the most widely distributed AI cloud by a huge margin. Our next generation of servers that begin to roll out in Q2 have GPUs built in by default and will support faster inference and even larger, more complicated models. Developers are building incredible new applications using Workers AI, and we're making it increasingly easy for them. \n We added support for Python, the second most popular programming language generally and the most common language for AI applications. We rolled out our partnership with Hugging Face, making it one-click simple to deploy most of their catalog of models to Cloudflare's network. And we added other bleeding edge models, including releasing Meta's Llama-3 production simultaneously the day it was announced. \n One of my favorite aspects of my job is I feel like I get to see into the future when I talk to developers who are building on Cloudflare Workers. I'm proud that we're delivering the tools they need to build applications that are intelligent, scalable and lightning-fast around the world. Internally and externally, our innovation engine continues to fire on all cylinders. And as I said, I've never been more excited about the future for Cloudflare, the Internet and us users who will get to enjoy the benefits of all of this innovation in so many aspects of our lives. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. Yes. I think we're really proud of our team for our ability to execute there. SASE, for those people who aren't as familiar with, is the forward proxy products that we sell. It helps make sure that employees who are using the Internet online are protected from malware, protected from malicious sites that the networks that you use as part of your business are as secure as possible. We were able to build our SASE platform on top of Cloudflare's existing network. And the advantage of that is that it means that you get a true platform. Not only do you get those forward proxy products, but a lot of times, we're bundling in our reverse proxy products. And that total solution is extremely compelling in the marketplace, and it's something that no other SASE vendor can match. And so I think we are a newer entrant into this space, but we've caught up very quickly. You can see we have improved more in the Gartner rankings, in the Forrester rankings than any other vendor in this space, and companies are taking notice. \n The other thing that I think everybody really loves is most security companies think that performance is sort of a nice to have, not a must have. We never accepted that. And so our SASE platform is significantly better and faster than anyone else. And so anyone who's listening to this if you're frustrated with the VPN that you have to log into, if you're frustrated with whatever service it's providing that, even if it's a new cloud service, if it's slowing you down and making it harder for you to do work, give us a call at Cloudflare because we can actually improve that and make it significantly better. And that's what we're seeing from customer after customer after customer is that our next-generation SASE platform is winning in this space. Yes, Andrew, I -- as I said, one of the most fun parts of my job is getting to see what developers are building. So let me give you a handful of examples off the top of my head and see if any of these are interesting. You can stop me if they get boring. I think one of the largest e-commerce platforms out there is starting to use Workers AI to do image classification and generate keywords for their shops. A start-up in the drone space is taking imagery and turning it into 3D models and using Workers AI to do that. They service around the globe, and so that's interesting. A handful of the public platform companies are using Workers AI for video description, transcribing, translation, all those things as AI. A multinational online food ordering company, every once in a while, a restaurant does submit a picture for one of the dishes. And so they're actually experimenting with Workers AI to generate pictures of the food that you're serving. Hopefully, they disclosed that it's not an actual picture. \n A handful of photo and video editing platforms are using Workers AI or evaluating it in order to do image enhancement and make that better. There's a start-up that's generating songs in whatever language you speak and local languages and they're using Workers AI in order to power their song generation platform. We're thinking about a large consulting companies, public companies, the big gaming company, all of which are actually worried about Shadow AI, and so they're actually using Workers AI gateway in order to understand how their own teams are using Workers. A start-up is using a series of enterprise summarization tools where they can look at a bunch of e-mails and very quickly summarize them into executive reports. There's another start-up that's creating an AI search engine. There's a public company in the financial services space that's doing real-time fraud detection. There are people who are finding ways to -- in the renovation space, how can you imagine, before you hire a contractor, what the space is going to look like in another sense. I mean I'll just go on and on and on with example after example after example. And our team just hands these to us every day, and it's so exciting to see what people are doing in this space and the different ways that they're using it. \n In terms of why, what is it about Cloudflare that's unique? I think there are sort of 3 things that stand out to me about it. The first is just the performance of Cloudflare Workers AI because we are distributed around the world and today, over 150 locations globally, as we serve customers that serve a global audience, we can just give them a much better experience in having to ship all of your code back to some central location. \n The second is that we can actually be significantly more cost effective. If you're using one of the big hyperscale clouds in order to do any sort of AI task, it's up to you to manage efficiency. You have to make sure that you're getting the most out of the GPU that you're renting whereas what we do is much more of a serverless AI model where you only pay for the task that you actually run. So especially in a lot of the start-ups, they're finding that they can just get significant better efficiency, significant better cost if they use our platform in order to deliver that AI experience. And then the third thing is that because we got it distributed globally and because of the fact that we have such a rich ecosystem that we've built, where you can get a soup-to-nuts AI experience, that's allowing people to actually fine-tune their models. \n And so my silly example of this is that if you have an AI that's responding back to a British user and describing what something looks like versus a U.S. user, in the U.K., you want color to be spelled C-O-L-O-U-R. In the U.S., you wanted to be sell C-O-L-O-R, because we can regionally tune that. We can actually correspond all of the local and regional differences all around the world. That's something that you don't get anywhere else. And that, I think, is going to be really important for these inference tasks. They're going to want to be run locally for both the normative and experienced reasons, but also for the regulatory reasons that are out there. So I'm super excited about what we're seeing in the AI space. I'm really proud of our team for being ahead of our rollout. We had to actually physically get gear to over 150 cities worldwide. And we're still on track to, by the end of this year, we think, be able to do AI inference from nearly every location that makes up Cloudflare network. Yes. I think federal is exciting for us. Last year, we achieved FedRAMP certification. That's opened a lot of FedRAMP -- excuse me, of federal deals to us. I think we've always had a great relationship with a lot of the members of the federal government. I think the thing, which is hard to appreciate that, as I talked to our federal customers, is how much they appreciate that when they ask us to help with something, we step up and help. So this year in the United States, obviously, is an election year, we've been running the Athenian Project since 2016, which provides our services at no cost to anyone who is helping administer an election anywhere in the United States. \n We've done similar things around the rest of the world. We've worked with the White House on a number of initiatives, including Project Safe Schools (sic) [ Project Cybersafe Schools ] in order to protect the most vulnerable schools and communities across the country. And that is all the foundation which I think has built an incredible amount of trust and an incredible amount of goodwill in the federal space. And so today, as the world is getting scarier and scarier and we're seeing more and more cyberattacks, the federal -- our federal business, I think, is being driven by the fact that we have great products, the fact that we have the certifications that are required to serve the federal government and the fact that we've built an incredible relationship as being not just a trusted vendor, but a true partner where we have helped make sure that when there's any public institution that is in true need anywhere across the country, we step up and help. And I think that's now turning into more and more business that is also generating significant revenue for us. I'll start and then Thomas may have more to add. I think the thing, which is really magical about Cloudflare's business, which is really elegant, is that it all fits together so well. So for instance, as we sell more of our Zero Trust and SASE products, those are extremely high-margin products, and they don't require a significant additional amount of CapEx. That then frees up our ability to invest that CapEx in other areas, including in the AI space. I think we made some very smart decisions, specifically reserving space and the equipment that we deployed knowing that AI would be part of our story at some point in the future. And so we really wanted to make sure that's the case. That means that as we deploy CapEx, it's literally not shipping an entire server to support AI, but shipping just the GPU cards that go into existing servers that are in the field. That reduces the amount of CapEx that has to be deployed. And again, it works because it is all running on one unified network. The fact that every server across Cloudflare's entire platform is capable of performing any function that we need, that has allowed us an enormous amount of flexibility in how we can deploy things and has helped us. \n The other part is that a lot of the hyperscale players, what they're really doing is they're renting out a full GPU or a full machine, whereas our business is a little bit different. We're selling the actual work that those machines do. What that means is that we can then be much more efficient at figuring out how to allow multi-tenant use of the equipment that we have provided, and we can make sure that the utilization is extremely high. So if -- and again, these are -- I don't know the exact numbers for each of the hyperscalers and they all have different -- slightly different characteristics. But in the average hyperscaler, if they're getting maybe 20% utilization out of a CPU or GPU resources that they've deployed, we can often be many times that in terms of the utilization where in CPUs we're seeing almost 80% utilization. So that efficiency allows us to get more out of every CapEx dollar. \n Finally, I would say that inference is different than training. And so you need different resources for that. You don't need necessarily the most cutting-edge GPUs in order to do inference tasks. And so that has meant that we haven't had to chase down what is a -- GPUs that have limited quantity. It's also meant that we can be much smarter about picking and choosing between different GPU vendors and matching workloads to whoever it is that can provide the best service. And I think over time, that gives us a significant advantage over people who are just trying to rent one particular type of GPU or rent that and let their customers figure out how to be as efficient as possible. Yes. I mean I think we are very fortunate that across the board, we are seen as a place where if you want to be innovative, if you want to invent the future, or if you want to sell really incredible products or help market them or frankly, work on some of the hardest public policy issues or get to work with Thomas on the world's coolest finance team, that you -- that Cloudflare is a place where you can go. And so when you see someone like Mark Anderson, when you see someone like Stephanie Cohen, you see the engineers who are coming to Cloudflare every day. We had 350,000 people apply to work at Cloudflare in Q1 for, I don't know, 250 jobs roughly. That's extraordinary. And that is -- and that's up over what was an extraordinary Q1 of last year, up almost 50% year-over-year. So I'm -- I think that the talent war is real, but we are in a fortunate position where we are winning that war. We have not seen an uptick in any regrettable attrition. It's been -- it's -- I think we're very fortunate to be working on some of the world's hardest problems. And some of the smartest people in the world want to come and help us on this. I'll start and then Thomas can maybe add some more if he has it. I think that -- I think we are still early in the journey of being really great at Enterprise. I think in Mark's comments, he said that our product is great, but our ability to really sell to large enterprises to understand their needs and drive more of a strategic relationship is something that we are continuing to work on. That is -- I think the last 18 months were all about us sort of cleaning up the sales organization. And now with Mark on board, it's all about now how do we get the real professionals on board, where we can become that strategic vendor for literally every large company in the world. There is no large company that doesn't have a need for what it is that we sell. \n What I think is really encouraging is where we have done that, where we have really nailed that. We are becoming one1 of the largest IT vendors for those companies. And some of those are very large companies. I think the fact that we won a very large financial services organization and became a strategic vendor for them, that -- and that, as I said, is a beachhead for us to go in and take much more share. Almost all the financial -- major financial services institutions in the United States use us for something. But I want to say that we're a strategic vendor for many of them yet. We're going to be. And we can do so many things in the networking and security space that they absolutely need. And as we, I think, mature that process, it's great. I can't imagine someone who is better for this role than Mark Anderson. And again, it was not the plan when we added him to our Board 4 years ago, but he's gotten to know us over that period of time. And it's just incredible to see the high caliber of talent who is excited to lean forward and work with him going forward. I think that we get a lot of signal based on where we sit on the Internet. And what I would say right now is that it's not any one thing pointing in any one clear direction. But there's a lot of noise pointing in a number of different directions that give us, I think, reason to be cautious. And I think that, that is in our very nature, is always taking as much signal being data-driven and making sure that we're making investments in a responsible way. And so I think the obvious thing is the geopolitical uncertainty around the world. That absolutely causes changes in buying behavior. \n On the other hand, some of that changes -- those changes in buying behavior have been positive for us as we're seeing, especially in our government business, pick up because of that uncertainty. So there are puts and takes that are out there. What we want to do is just make sure that we are being prudent and responsible and thoughtful as we make investments and as we think through how to handle the responsibility that we have with investors capital and that they've trusted us with. Yes. We're incredibly excited to have the Nefeli team on board. We want to make it -- we think the space that Cloudflare competes in is in the networking and in the security space. And so making it very easy to get traffic on to our network to connect to any other cloud is just a critical aspect and it seemed like something that we were either going to have to build or buy. And we came across the Nefeli team in part because they came in through our own launch pad program, which is a program having customers that -- and start-ups that use Cloudflare's resources and especially our workers' platform in order to build. \n What is powerful about that is we use that same platform to build ourselves. And so when we find great teams working in a space that we think is exciting, building on the same platform, the same platform that our own team uses, that just decreases the risk of any kind of technical integration, any kind of sort of Frankenstein-ing  of your platform that's out there. And so the Nefeli team was really great, and we were excited to announce it. We think that, again, our hurdle rate for acquisitions and M&A remains very, very high. But these -- some of these small acquisitions, where we found great teams working in interesting spaces, has worked incredibly well for us. \n A couple of other examples that are very similar. Baselime that we acquired is, again, giving server observability to our platform. It's one of the #1 things that developers on our platform were looking for. And again, another time where we found someone that is using our own platform in order to build out a great observability platform there. PartyKit, which is a real-time integration service, again, it's just a natural extension of what it is that we're doing. So again, none of these are very large acquisitions, but I think they're extremely strategic. I think they accelerate our ability to get into more markets. \n And what I love is that they oftentimes are using our own existing developer platform, which means that they are just incredibly easy for us to integrate with the rest of Cloudflare and decrease the technical risk as we go with M&A. In all 3 of those cases, also, the founders and the team, they're just sort of Cloudflare-like people and they're people that we're so excited and proud to have on the team. And I think you'll hear more about the wins that we have from all those areas over the quarters to come. Well, I think that what I would look at is CapEx as a percentage of revenue. And I think one of the things that's always been magical about Cloudflare has been that we've been able to invest behind the demand, not ahead of the demand. And so we're really good at rolling out more capacity wherever we need it. And so that would be an amazing problem to have. If we have to -- we -- so it may be that we, on a just pure dollars basis, end up spending more on GPUs. But as a percentage of revenue, we feel very comfortable that we can service these applications very well at the percentage of revenues that it is in our forecast going forward. Yes, Alex. So I -- 2 years ago, I felt like we had a pretty clear signal that the economy was slowing down. I would say that we don't have as clear of signal today that that's the case. We -- it's -- we see things that worry us, but we also see things that give us some level of optimism. And so I think describing the crystal ball as cloudy is the right thing. What I like though is that we have a crystal ball. We can make investments and we can think through what that future looks like, in part because we just get much more signal than I think the average enterprise SaaS company gets. And I think that, that has served us well. And I think we try not to be surprising in any way. And so as we see -- I would say that there is certainly an uptick in uncertainty and sort of potential downside this quarter over last quarter. But I would not characterize it as the same concerns that I had in Q1 of '20 -- what was that, '22 where we saw what we thought was much, much clearer. So we continue to watch this. Again, I feel like I am proud of how well Thomas and the rest of the team have the ability to take that and keep their hands on the levers of our business and continue to execute. But I'm not -- I think my level of concern is not at the same level that it was in Q1 of 2022, but it is definitely heightened over a lot of what we've seen in more recent quarters. Yes. Alex, I'll start and then Thomas can give a little bit more color. I would push back on your initial statement, which was that nothing spooks me. A lot spooks me right now. So just because just -- and I want to make it clear, we are in a much more uncertain environment and the signal that we're seeing is that uncertainty is up. In addition to that, I think you're correct that whenever you have a sales leadership change, there is risk that comes with it. And so there's a bit of that. But the primary factor here is that as we look at the signals in the overall macro economy, it is -- it feels like a much more -- it feels like there's much more reason to worry in Q1 than there was in Q4. But that doesn't mean that it was the same, just sound the alarm bells that we were seeing back in Q1 of 2022. Yes. I think that the big thing, Tim, that I'd point to is that they tend to be purely usage-based models. And the good of usage-based models is that they react very quickly, both up and down. And so I think whereas we tend to be much more of a subscription-based model, and the good of that is that it has a lot more stability. But -- and that stability helps you when things are slowing down. So we had significantly faster growth than the hyperscalers in the last few quarters, and we're now around where they are this quarter. And so I think we are a little bit more moderated than some of the more usage-based models. And I think that explains some of it. \n I think the second thing that I'd add is that for some of the products, especially around the AI products, as Thomas said, we're really optimizing around adoption. And while we published pricing and that pricing was extremely well received, in addition to being very, very attractive for us from a margin perspective in the last months, that's something that is still not a place where we are heavily monetizing yet. But again, I think as I listed some of the examples, we see plenty of opportunity there. And we think that when we decide the time is right to turn on some of those monetization, it will help contribute to our top line growth. So on the competition front, we really don't. We think that we are in a very unique position. We don't see anybody else that is yet rolling out the type of connectivity cloud with true serverless architecture. There are people who are buying some legacy businesses. There are people who sort of talk a good game, but it turns out, when you pull the covers back, don't have very much business in this space at all. And so we are, I think, unique in the position that we're offering. \n I don't think that will stay true forever. Other people will provide services here, but we have a clear lead. We have the richest ecosystem. And I think that what's great about Cloudflare's business is that we have existing, very stable businesses that continue to perform. We have newer businesses for us like our Zero Trust and SASE businesses, which are just accelerating up the S-curve. And then we have a lot of bleeding edge opportunity with things like our Workers' platform. And so Cloudflare is all about stacking S-curves, one behind another, behind another. And so where I think a lot of companies run out of TAM, run out of market, we are able to continue to add and innovate into new areas in a way that I think we'll achieve what we want, which is we think we're going to be one of the truly iconic technology companies and we're investing for that long term, including at times making the choice of optimizing for adoption rather than trying to figure out how we make money from every single customer with every single transaction. And we think that, that's the right formula for building what is an iconic technology company over the long term. I just want to thank our entire team for executing. I know that in the world right now, there's a lot of scary things going on. There's a lot of tension, and what we do every day of making sure that the Internet continues to function, that it continues to be a force that drives the economy around the world going forward. I can't imagine anything more important to be working on. So thank you for the entire team for delivering yet another terrific quarter. We're getting back to work now, and we'll see you all again next quarter. Thank you."
