I'll begin this morning with an overview of fourth quarter and full-year results and drivers of performance and share some thoughts on 2021. Collin will take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $5 billion, 11% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of one fewer business day in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019 and up 10.7% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 13.3% to $881 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $376 million, an increase of 9.9%. Our non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, 16.1% above last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant currency. For the year, net sales were $18.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion year-over-year or 2.4% on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross profit increased 5.6% to $3.2 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 2.6% to $1.4 billion and non-GAAP net income per share increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis to $6.59. 2020 was an extraordinary year. I am very proud of how the CDW team quickly and smartly adapted to help our customers and partners during a challenging time. The diversity of our solutions portfolio and customer end markets served us well in 2020, providing balance and driving our exceptional results. During the year, our team helped customers across the full IT solution stack in the full IT life cycle from client devices to cloud from design to managed services. We executed against our strategy and continued to invest in high growth solutions and services capabilities, including three acquisitions, IGNW, a leading provider of cloud-native service expertise and software development capabilities, and - excuse me, and Southern Dakota Solutions, which expanded our ServiceNow team. Performance for our customer end markets varied. Demand increased in some and decreased in others, but all experienced change or disruption to their technology needs and to their operations last year due to COVID-19. Our value proposition resonated with customers. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and logistical and distribution capabilities to deliver the best outcomes for our customers. This led to meaningful outperformance compared to the US IT market. We emerged from 2020 stronger and even more committed to executing our strategy. Turning to the fourth quarter. We continue to help customers with remote enablement and resource optimization, cost reduction, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. Similar to the third quarter, some customers resumed solutions projects and others started new projects. Performance for our most impacted customer end markets improved, and trends for our more resilient customer end markets remained strong. During the fourth quarter, we continued to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges and support our customers, in particular, for Chromebooks for K-12 customers where demand greatly outstrip supply. Now let's take a deeper look at fourth quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 11% with similar levels of performance for transactions and solutions. In total, there was improvement versus the last two quarters. Customer spend for corporate customers is not uniform. Some customers were doing well and investing in technology, whereas other customers, those who are in challenged industries or geographies who were impacted by spikes and COVID cases were still cautious. Small Business declined mid-single digits, as notebooks returned to growth. Small Business customers tend to be more nimble than corporate customers, which drove the improvement versus the third quarter. The Government team increased net sales 30%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up strong double-digits. During the quarter, our Device as a Service solution for the US Census Bureau was mostly completed. All devices were returned to us for decommissioning, and we started the process to resell the clean units through third-party re-marketers. Our team did an excellent job with this program. It was a multi-year effort to develop and execute this large complex undertaking, moving the nation's once-a-decade population count from paper to digital for the first time. Our services and logistical capabilities and multi-vendor solutions set us apart from the competition. We are unique in what we can deliver to our customers. Outside of the Census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies with remote enablement and device refresh. We also delivered on Department of Defense projects that were awarded at the end of the third quarter. The state and local team delivered strong double-digit growth. IT investments continued to be a priority despite budget pressure. Our team helped customers enable remote capabilities and restart solution projects. Education increased in extraordinary 140%, driven by phenomenal growth in K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access and remote learning, which drove triple-digit growth for notebooks, related accessories and solutions, as customers turn to us for holistic capabilities. Higher education increased low double digits, as schools continued to help students with remote enablement and resumed net comp projects with a focus on creating connected communities to enhance the student experience. Healthcare declined mid-teens, a meaningful improvement compared to the third quarter. Customers continued to be cautious with their spend due to ongoing budget pressure, focusing on key areas like remote enablement, telehealth and support infrastructure. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations was flat on a reported basis. UK net sales increased mid-single digits in constant currency, and Canada net sales decreased low double digits in constant currency. Performance for both markets was driven by strong education demand to enable remote learning and health care spending to address the pandemic, with softer corporate performance. In the UK, there was some pull-in up customer demand before the announcement of the agreement with the EU, as customers prepared for a potential hard exit [ph] Over the last several weeks, the UK team has executed against its well-planned Brexit mitigation strategy and has done a great job helping customers navigate through the complexity of the new agreement. Our fourth quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers across all categories. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth, in particular for our public segment customers, leading to over 30% client device growth. While software was flat, software gross profit increased mid-teens, reflecting continued growth into Software-as-a-Service. Services grew low double digits, driven by device decommission services for the Census project and configuration services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. Transactions increased strong double digits. Solutions declined low single digits, as some customers continued to restore infrastructure and larger project engagement. The team delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in collaboration, infrastructure as a service, security and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue. Let me also share a little more color on our security practice, given its importance to our customers, as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double digits, as customers improved their security framework to respond to increasing threat. Last year, customers spent $2 billion with us on security. Our fourth quarter and full year operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy. They are important drivers of our path and our future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customer's total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I've shared, the balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in current environment. And the final driver of our performance, our three-part strategy for growth is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share, second, enhance our solutions capabilities, and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy and action and how we helped customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped the born-in-the-cloud financial technology company add more agility and flexibility to its operations and technology stack by becoming multi-cloud. The customer initially came to our team requesting help to implement a backup solution for its existing public cloud provider. After a review by our Digital Velocity team, our team uncovered the need for the customer to become multi-cloud with additional capabilities and redundancies. Our team helped the customer build a secure second public cloud environment and address additional needs, including application development, functionality and consumption management. Our team has established CDW as a trusted partner with expensive cloud capabilities to help with research, evaluation, procurement, implementation and management. Our customers are increasingly adopting cloud but are also finding a growing need to become multi-cloud. CDW's cloud expertise and cloud management platform across the multi public clouds are a differentiator in the marketplace. Let me share another story in health care sector. To address COVID, health care customers have turned to CDW to provide care in new settings and in new ways. An independent non-profit health care provider in the US Northeast needed our guidance to enable remote COVID testing and vaccine distribution in numerous outdoor locations. The CDW account manager engaged one of our networking specialists to develop a solution that would deliver the required performance and scale quickly. The solution has since been rolled out to all locations and in next work with the customer on the site's wireless connectivity further leveraging our technical resources and strengthening their relationship. Our team saved the customer time and energy and provided great service as a forward-thinking partner that the customer can trust. The pandemic has created new issues requiring creative solutions and leading customers to rely on us more than ever as an extension of their team. This is the value that CDW brings to our customers. We pair our broad solutions portfolio with our deep technical expertise to deliver the full outcomes that customers need. Finally, the digital divide has created significant learning challenges around the world. Our teams have worked closely with education customers in the US, in the UK and in Canada to tackle this challenge. In the UK, we are working with the London Grid for Learning, a charitable trust dedicated to the advancement of education to provide technology for hundreds of schools across the country. Last quarter, our team developed and provisioned unique turnkey solutions comprised of client devices, accessories, software and services, leveraging our strong logistical and distribution capabilities and deep vendor relationships. There has been tight collaboration with our clients' vendor partner to provide the best possible device availability for the customer due to the current global Chromebook's buy constraint. Our distribution center in the UK has done a tremendous job to deliver over 100,000 units to date to hundreds of schools. CDW is uniquely positioned to deliver for our customers and our vendor partners. This is a great example of our critical role. These examples highlight CDW's three-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the success of investments in cloud, our strong relationships with customers and vendors and the importance of our competitive advantages. I am proud of the way our team continues to deliver. Let me briefly update you now on our COVID response efforts. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have followed three key principles: First, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers, second, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers, and third, support our communities. I'm proud of how the team has managed the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Teams at our distribution and configuration centers have done an outstanding job, maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while adhering to new protocols that safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers who come to work every day. We've also taken deliberate actions to foster collaboration and coworker engagement and to maintain connectivity and productivity to preserve and bolster our culture, even while we are distant. These actions include leveraging new tools and learning and development opportunities, expanded health and well-being programs, increased content from our business resource groups and compensation investment to recognize the team's tremendous efforts and performance. Now let me share some thoughts on 2021. The near-term global health and macroeconomic environment is still uncertain. Our current outlook is for the US IT market to return to growth and grow between 2.5% and 3%. As you know, we hold ourselves accountable for growing faster than the IT market, and we expect our topline in 2021 to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. There are many wildcards, though, including COVID-19 government restrictions and vaccine rollout; policies from the new administration, including stimulus programs and tax changes, and supply constraints, in particular, for Chromebooks. We are encouraged about our Q1 performance to date and how our teams are executing, but we are also cautious about the macro environment. Even though uncertainty continues, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Last year, we went through our rigorous strategic planning process, as we do every three years, and we are now accelerating investment and execution against it. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, to enhance our competitive position and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. This confidence has led our Board of Directors to increase our share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives; and of course, out-execute the competition. Now, Colin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin?\nCollin Kebo: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full year results, capital allocation priorities and initial thoughts on 2021. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on slide nine. Consolidated net sales were $5 billion, up 9.2% on a reported basis and 11% on an average daily sales basis as we had one less selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 7.6% versus the third quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality of a mid-single digit decline, primarily due to how COVID-19 is impacting our channels differently. During this uncertain time, seasonality has been and is expected to continue to be, different than historical experience. Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand writings commentary shared on our last earnings call other than K-12, where demand was even stronger than expected. Pockets of supply constraints continued in the quarter, primarily for lower end client devices such as Chromebooks. Our team did a great job navigating the fluid environment and leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure a healthy share of supply for customers. Gross profit for the quarter was $881 million, an increase of 13.3%. Gross margin was 17.8%, up 70 basis points over last year. The gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Turning to SG&A on slide 10. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 15.9%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs due to higher gross profit and compensation investments in our coworkers to recognize and reward their tremendous efforts and performance in 2020. The acquisition of IGNW, an ongoing investment in Aptris, and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline coworkers, partially offset by continued cost savings measures, including decreased travel and entertainment. Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,982, up two from the third quarter. Year-over-year, coworker count increased 86, driven by an increase of approximately 150 customer-facing coworkers, including IGNW, partially offset by a decrease in non-customer-facing coworker count. GAAP operating income was $332 million, up 17.1%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $376 million, up 9.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%. Moving to slide 11. Interest expense was $37 million, down 2.9%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from the August refinancing. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 12 was 19.2%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $57 million compared to $50 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2%, down 150 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with new regulations for global intangible low tax income and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by lower tax credits. As you can see on slide 14, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.65, up 29.6%. Our non-GAAP net income was $264 million in the quarter, up 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, up 16.1% from last year. Turning to our full year results on slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $18.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. Gross profit was $3.2 billion, up 5.6%. Gross profit margin was 17.4%, up 50 basis points, driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to put 2020 sales and gross profit in context. We have consistently highlighted the power of our diverse portfolio and customer end markets. We pivot to where the growth is, leveraging our competitive advantages to better serve customers and gain share. In 2020, we estimate the US IT market declined low single digits, call it down 2%. CDW net sales grew 440 basis points faster and gross profit grew 760 basis points faster than the 2% market decline. Census contributed 170 basis points of year-over-year net sales growth. Excluding the Census, CDW still delivered meaningful net sales and gross profit growth in excess of market. During the 2009 recession, our net sales premium narrowed as customers paused on hardware purchases, and gross profit margin compressed due to product margin pressure in the competitive environment. In 2020, our portfolio performed differently, partially because of the unique dynamics of the pandemic, but also because of the progress we've made building out the solution and services capabilities our customers value. For example, while US software and services collectively totaled 18% of US net sales in 2020, they accounted for approximately 40% of US gross profit. Returning to the full year P&L. Operating income was $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, up 2.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, down 120 basis points versus last year's rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to new regulations for global intangible low tax income and non-deductible expenses that are not expected to contribute as much of a benefit to the tax rate in 2021. Net income was $789 million and non-GAAP net income was $954 million, up 5.8%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $6.59, up 8%. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 21. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion, and net debt was $2.5 billion. Liquidity further strengthened with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.5 billion. Full year free cash flow was $1.2 billion, as shown on slide 22, this equates to 6.7% of sales, well above our historical free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25%. A portion of the outperformance was driven by timing or one-time items, including mixing into vendors with extended payment terms, the Census, deferred payroll and UK tax payments and the timing of collections from some large customers. We expect the favorable timing to reverse over the next few quarters. Moving to slide 23. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down one day from last year's fourth quarter. DSO and DIO were unchanged from last year, while DPO increased by one day. The increase in DPO was primarily driven by mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. As previously mentioned, we resumed our share buyback program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of stock. For full year 2020, we returned $561 million to shareholders, including $220 million of dividends and $341 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $129 per share. Turning to capital allocation priorities on slide 24. Given our strong liquidity position, our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times. We ended the year at 1.7 times. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we acquired two small ServiceNow solution practices to build on the success from our 2019 acquisition of Aptris. We remain active evaluating targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to move closer to our target net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. At the end of December, we had $338 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As Chris mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.25 billion increase to the share repurchase program in support of our capital allocation priorities. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on slide 25. The current environment continues to be highly uncertain, making it challenging to forecast expectations for IT market growth with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, we are providing a base case for 2021 IT market growth and how we expect CDW's business to perform in that environment. Our base case assumes US IT market growth between 2.5% to 3%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than market. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 50 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. In terms of performance by segment for the year, there continues to be uncertainty among customers across end markets, but here are some drivers to consider. On the commercial side of the business, Corporate and Small Business customers tend to respond quicker to the macroeconomic environment. We saw that last year, Q1 was the strongest quarter, then Q2 experienced the steepest decline with quarterly declines moderating thereafter. We expect the timing and slope of the rebound in 2021 to be closely tied to customer confidence, which will be a function of the macroeconomic environment and success containing the virus. Moving to Public. We expect continued success supporting Department of Defense and civilian agencies. However, Government is not expected to fully make up the loss of the Census project, which contributed a total of approximately 230 basis points of net sales to CDW in 2020. Education growth is expected to be strong earlier in the year, with sales above historical seasonality and then decelerate throughout the year due to overlaps in the unusual seasonality experienced in 2020. Chromebook supply continued to be a wildcard. Healthcare overlaps are tougher in the first half as customer demand spiked at the beginning of the pandemic and then comparison feeds in the second half. The timing and slope of a rebound in 2021 is linked to budget clarity, which we expect to be a function of success containing the virus and potential stimulus support. Finally, our international businesses are more weighted to Corporate customers, so the pace of recovery will be driven by the macro environments in the UK and Canada. Moving down the P&L. Assuming IT market growth of 2.5% to 3%, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range and non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid to high single digits, call it 6.5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the following below the operating line assumptions. One, a modest decline in interest expense to the mid to high 140s, two, a non-GAAP effective tax rate at the low-end of our typical 25.5% to 26.5% range, assuming current tax rates. The low end of the range is approximately 150 basis points higher than 2020's 24% rate, creating a headwind of over 200 basis points on earnings per share growth. Three, contribution from share repurchases with non-GAAP earnings per share growing approximately 200 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Currency is expected to contribute approximately 40 basis points to reported earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization can be found on page 26. Turning to the first quarter. Historically, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline on an average daily sales basis has averaged down approximately 7%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be down high single digits more than historical seasonality, primarily due to Census and Mississippi Department of Education. On a year-over-year average daily sales basis, this equates to mid-single digit growth, reflecting continued education and government strength, improving commercial trends, partially offset by the overlap of the March 2020 work-from-home surge. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be a couple of hundred basis points higher than the full year EPS outlook, as we overlap last year's increase in the credit loss reserve, partially offset by having one fewer selling day, which adversely impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. This is timing, and we will recoup the day in the fourth quarter. January segment trends are generally in line with my commentary on first quarter expectations. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on slide 27. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged to 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. We expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. We believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cree to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each one of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good morning. How much do you think the supply constraints on Chromebooks impacted the December quarter? In other words, how much better would you have done in December? And then, when do you expect those supply constraints to loosen up this year?\nCollin Kebo: Hi, Katy. Good morning. We did carry a higher backlog than normal out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter. In terms of when we expect supply conditions to get better, obviously, very difficult and fluid to call with any precision. But our expectation would be through the course of the first half of the year, we would see supply on the Chromebook side of the business begin to return to normal.\nKaty Huberty: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up. As netted-down revenue increases and drives gross margins higher, how should we think about the flow-through to the operating margin line? Does sales commission fully offset that gross margin expansion? Or should we see some scale benefits and potential operating margin expansion over time?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. I mean, you're right. There is a little bit of a give back on the sales comp line because we pay on gross profit dollars. I think, Katy, from a secular perspective, our expectation is consistent with yours that we would expect netted-down items in software and services to grow faster than the balance of the business. I think we're just a little careful though of trying to understand where we are in the cycle and whether a hardware refresh is coming and if it is coming, how strong it could be. So I think that's something to keep in mind as you think about that netted-down mix and the impact it has on gross margin going forward, at least over the next several quarters. I think the other thing to think through on the margin and then the flow-through to NGOI margin is we did benefit from really an exceptional product margin in 2020. And I think some of that was due to the unique dynamics of the supply environment, as well as the premium that customers were placing on speed. And so I think that's just also another thing to keep in mind as we think about gross margin going forward. And I think those are probably more secular - cyclical than secular, but something to think about.\nKaty Huberty: That's helpful color. Congrats on the quarter.\nCollin Kebo: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Chris, you're guiding fiscal '21 for another year of 200 to 300 basis points outperformance versus the US IT market. And that's despite the year-on-year 200-odd basis points headwind from the Census project. Given all the uncertainty that you've talked about, I mean, maybe for us, can you just give us your thoughts on what are some of the opportunities you have? What is giving you confidence to guide for the full year, that 200 to 300 basis point outperformance? And what - and in that vein, what can the federal - are there other opportunities to offset that headwind from Census? So just your thoughts on what's driving your confidence on the full year?\nChris Leahy: Sure. Thanks, Ruplu. Thanks for being on the call. Yeah, we always hold ourselves accountable for outperforming the market. So on a relative basis, we always expect ourselves to do better. And when you think about the combination of our competitive advantages, you saw them in play really in one of the hardest periods in history in 2020. So we are confident that the advantages that we bring to the market will position us and allow us to continue to outperform a pivot to where our customers need us and grow faster than the market. When I think about headwinds and tailwinds going into 2020, certainly, think about remote work and remote everything. And that has certainly been driving growth in 2020 and should continue to do so into 2021. That we've got some very significant compares, as you all know, because of the first quarter of last year, because of the timing of the education needs the end of this past year in Census. But it will still continue to be a trend, we believe. Everyone will not be going to straight back to work, and we think it will be a work-from-everywhere kind of situation. We also believe that this digital acceleration is just going to continue. And so our strength across the full stack, and when I say full stack, I mean, cloud services, software and hardware plays very well with our customers because customers are always full stack, and they're looking for a full solution. So as they think about combined multi-vendor, multi component solutions, CDW is a great partner for them. And we can take them from the very front end of advising and designing to building, implementing, integrating, orchestrating and managing. And I'll tell you, it seems that 2020 has really propelled customers to look for that value-added one-stop shop trusted IT provider that can do the full spectrum across the whole life cycle. So, we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our customers. On the federal side, I think you asked about specifically the Department of Defense and Civilian, we expect to continue to maintain pretty strong. Look, on the commercial side on Small Business and Corporate, I'll tell you as Colin said, the speed and the slope of any recovery is tied to confidence, which is tied to the macro, which is tied to the virus. It's all tied together. So that's very hard to predict. But we've been staying so close to our customers during 2020 that we feel absolutely confident that we will be well-positioned to help them on their way up and to capture growth as they're growing. On the Government side, stimulus is another wildcard out there. And under the new administration, if we see some stronger stimulus, that should also help to support on the education, healthcare and state and local side.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details there, Chris. That makes sense. Just for my follow-up. In the UK, given the resurgence of COVID-19, have you seen any impact to your operations? And you talked about M&A on the call. Can you just give us your thoughts on any geographic expansion possibility in 2021? Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, sure. In the UK, I'll tell you, I mentioned that we saw a little bit of buy ahead as people - as customers were anticipating possibly a hard Brexit. So we saw some benefit in the fourth quarter. But the good news Ruplu, remember, we put the mitigation strategy in place with our Netherlands entity, and we've really been helping customers utilize that entity in the EU. So while we've gone back into lockdown, it does feel like - it feels like customers are used to working that way and are still buying in the areas where they have needs, like remote work - optimizing remote work, et cetera. So we haven't seen a significant impact any different than we would have seen in 2020. And we're managing this really quite well at this point. In terms of M&A, yeah, look, we never really pinpoint where we're going to be - what we're going to be doing, but you know we're focused on geographic expansion, as well as expanding our capabilities, our technology capabilities. So, we continue to look. We continue to be very active. I doubt there's a deal out there that doesn't get to CDW store to see, but we also have our screens that we need to adhere to, which are - the cultural and operating match, the financial match and the strategic match. So we'll continue to look. We're excited about this [indiscernible] we did this year that continue to grow our cloud native and ServiceNow capabilities. And frankly, we're seeing the real benefit from those in terms of traction with our sales organization and deeper connections with our customers because we're really at the front end of that IT supply chain, if you will, helping them to devise solutions and then fulfilling. So those have been real positive winners for CDW and our customers.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Congrats on the strong results.\nChris Leahy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a really good print [ph] here. I guess, two for me as well. First off, when I think about this calendar '21 revenue guide, 4.5% to 6%, give or take, I'd love to understand how does that stack up between transactional and solutions? What does that SKU look like? And then - I guess, how do you do PCs in that narrative for /21?\nChris Leahy: Yeah, good morning. It's really interesting - rather, I'm sorry, it's really interesting. I would tell you that 2021 is almost a harder year to determine what sits underneath that IT market rate of growth. There's a wide dispersion of forecast out there across various technologies. And what I would say is, I don't think anybody really knows precisely. What we plan to do is what we do best, which is pivot where our customers need us. And whether that be in the client hardware, refresh area, whether it be in building out cloud capabilities, we're able to go in either direction. And we're just staying very close to our customers working with them literally day-by-day, week-by-week and supporting them in their technology needs. Certainly, technology is more essential than ever. We don't see any of the trends slowing down, frankly. We might see some things prolonged as a result of the pandemic, and the vaccine don't go as we all hope. But at the end of the day, it's a mix, and it's really quite hard to tell. I know that's not a great answer to the question of what it comprises, but it's very hard to know given the unprecedented uncertainty that we still have. I think sometimes, I think people felt in some ways we've come through 2020, and now we're in 2021. And it's sunrise and glory ahead. And I think we really have to be cautious and conscious of where we sit in the vaccine rollout and new strains coming up, and we just have to be very methodical in listening to our customers and taking care of them, which we're very good at doing.\nAmit Daryanani: That's really fair. And then I guess on the cloud spend, Chris, you talked a few times about that business being up double-digits, and I think you said you expect this to continue. Is the shift to cloud driving new customers to CDW that haven't engaged with you before and they need to help to get to the cloud? Or is it more existing customers that are just migrating from on to off-premise? And in that latter scenario, how does that play out through your P&L? Is that a good thing for CDW's revenue and profitability? Or it's [Indiscernible] impact?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. On the first question, Amit, I'd say both. We are - you know, we certainly mean more heavily into penetrating current customers as you saw, but we are bringing in new customers with our cloud capabilities and our Digital Velocity and ServiceNow processes in particular. Again, as I mentioned earlier, they're really at the front end of that discussion advisory. And that's where we're able to bring a great deal of value to the customer and the planning, particularly in a world where things are changing so quickly and plans that had been expected and in place four, five, 12 months ago are moving, and we're very well-positioned to help them with that. So it's both customers, new and existing. And we do expect to continue to see growth there. I would note that on the - you asked about existing customers and migrating to the cloud. One of the interesting things that I know you're aware of, that it's not just migrating to the cloud, but it's also some customers who are already cloud and becoming multi-cloud. So multi public cloud, other customers who are - have some public cloud capabilities that they need to almost mirror that on-prem. So it's the whole - I'll call it the cloud environment, the whole ecosystem that our teams are able to support customers with now. Again, which is a real advantage because it's bringing the customer the best for the customer and not just some narrow product category that we sell. In terms of the impact on the P&L, I think Collin is going to jump in here.\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. Good morning, Amit. I mean, because most of it gets netted down, it obviously has the lift on gross margin and operating margin. I think if you look at it on gross profit divided by what the customer is actually spending, I would say cloud is very much like our entire portfolio. There are some things in it that are higher margin. Security would be a good example of that. A lot of it's delivered via the cloud. And there are other things that are more commodity like in terms of cloud offerings and would have lower margins. So, in terms of the absolute amount of profit, it's really a function of how margin-rich the particular offering is, which is typically rooted in value from the - perceived value from the customer, as well as then the services that we can wrap around at another value we can bring by consumption.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Morning. Chris, you alluded to the strategic planning process and accelerating investments alongside that. As I look at the fiscal '21 early outline, it looks like operating margin is going to be flattish year-over-year. CapEx is going to be above the rule of thumb. So just hoping if we could get a little bit more color on the nature of these implied investments, and how we can think about gauging success or expected return over time?\nChris Leahy: Sure. Good morning, Adam. Yes, let me step back on the strategic process. You know, we do this every three years. And our overarching strategy hasn't changed, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. I would say what we do is we really hone where we're focusing our energy and investments to evolve the business, as technology evolves. And where we're focusing now, are those areas in strategic services and solutions that our customers need. You heard me mention full stack is a way that we go to market. And investments in the capabilities across that full stack, such as cloud solutions, cloud services, software solutions and services, in particular, security and then obviously, our hardware. I think about a couple of recent acquisitions, Scalar, and IGNW, as excellent examples of that strategy in action where we invested in cloud and DevOps capabilities and ServiceNow capabilities, and those are the areas that customers are needing advisers. The other area that you can think about that we're investing in is our talent and digital in particular. So our technology, our own technology, we kind of put the mirror on ourselves and made some decisions about what we need as an organization. And we're investing in our own technical capabilities, but also those digital tools that we've talked about in the past for sellers. I think you've heard us talk about AMANDA [ph] We have a number of other tools in the pipeline that allow our sellers in our digital platform, our e-commerce platform to work for our customer in a really integrated, seamless intelligent way. And that's what we're going for. And then obviously, we're also reviewing our operating model as we always do, but even what was more custom-wide, I'd say now to really remove those things that we - that are inefficiencies and recoup where we can and then re-imagine critical elements for a digital world and then reinvest back in the business. So investing in technology, also investing in talent. We talked last quarter about a reduction in our workforce, but a reduction was also to open up capacity for those rules and capabilities that we need, and we have been investing in people there. So technology, people and digital is where you see the investment, as well as capabilities behind those high growth areas.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. It makes sense. And maybe this is a follow-up for Colin, more in near term. You talked about how seasonality is expected to continue to be different than historical for the next few quarters and modeling has gotten tougher for us. You've historically talked about a first half, second half split of 48 to 52. Is there any way that we could maybe think about 2021 in those terms?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. Adam, we elected not to provide thoughts on that, just given the highly uncertain environment, both on the demand and the supply side, frankly. I mean, some of my comments in the prepared remarks were slope of recovery tied to economy and virus, which I think is inherently uncertain and the supply environment is uncertain. So at this point, no perspective on that. Obviously, when we get on the call next quarter, we can provide more thoughts on that.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Cabral: Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to dig into more of the on-premise hardware side of the business. Just curious if you could give a little bit more color on what you're seeing across categories like servers, storage, NetComm? And just how we should think about that business and the potential for some refresh activity heading into 2021?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Good morning, Matt. Yeah, I'll go back to the comments I made earlier, which is, it's hard to know the timing and slope of when we might see server storage in particular pickup. For example, in the Corporate space, we think about timing around when customers are really getting back to the office, which probably won't be through the second half of the year. We are seeing some pickup in areas like higher Ed as example, where they're really focused on a connected community. So they've really extended what that connected campus looks like. But until we start to see, I think a strength in recovery, which, of course, is related to the virus, we're pretty cautious around on-prem solutions. We also haven't obviously been able to get into locations. We still haven't been able to get into too many locations to help our customers there. So I would just say, look, a refresh will be coming. It's hard to know when in 2021 or beyond that will be.\nMatt Cabral: Got it. And then on the commercial side of the business, just looking at the fourth quarter, is it - an improvement in this trajectory in Small Business, a little bit more of a modest uptick in Corporate. Just wondering if you can compare and contrast a little bit what you're seeing across those two customer types? And how we should think about the pace of recovery, particularly for Corporate as we head into 2021?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Matt, I think, you know, and we said this before Small Businesses just tend to be more nimble. And so at the beginning of 2021 - 2020, excuse me, they went - they slowed down more quickly and they've come back up more quickly. So I think that's just the nature of Small Businesses. On the Corporate side, it's really - we referenced it as kind of multiple layers and mosaics, and it's to say that we're really seeing the same thing. It depends by geography. It depends by industry, even individual customers within segments, winners and losers, so to speak. So it's really a mix across geo industry and individual customers. I will say that we did see some budget flush at the end of the year, which felt like a good thing. But again, until we see the macroeconomics uncertainty subside and we see more customer confidence, which, of course, is driven by the success in stemming the virus, I think we're still going to be a little cautious on Corporate. On the other hand, look, when things do normalize, we would expect Corporate and Small Business similar to what we saw in 2009 and '10 to really pick up again, and we'll be well-prepared to help them do that.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Yang with Citi.\nTim Yang: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a question on Corporate and Small Business recovery as well. Chris, on slide six, you show that your sub-sector recovery cadence in financial crisis, and I think it took only 1.5 to 2 years for Corporate and Small Business to be back to pre-crisis level. For 2021 recovery, do you expect Corporate and Small Business to recover faster or slower than financial crisis, given we might have more stimulus package, but also there are COVID uncertainties?\nChris Leahy: Yes. No, these are great questions. I wish I had a better crystal ball to answer them. It's just hard to say, the unique dynamics of this downturn and the pandemic have really, I think, made it harder to predict and I think less comparable to what we saw in 2008, '09 and '10. And as Collin said in his prepared remarks, the speed and the slope of the recovery is really in every way related to the success containing the virus. So if we can get that under control and we can stem the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and I think we'll see it recover more quickly and maybe with a very healthy slope given the importance of technology. If we don't see that, I think we're going to see more muted growth over a longer period of time. Certainly, the stimulus is yet another wildcard, which can help in the areas that we've mentioned, education, state and local, et cetera, and can of course help get that positive momentum going with the consumer, which ultimately impacts the businesses. But I just think the dynamics of this environment and the pandemic make it incredibly difficult to predict timing and flow. Again, the beautiful thing is the diversity of our end markets allows us to make sure that we are where the growth is and able to support our customers wherever they need us better than anyone.\nTim Yang: Got it. That's very helpful. You mentioned K-12 demand strength and your education sector Q4 performance was much better than normal seasonality. Can you maybe just talk about how sustainable the demand is? And how should we think about the full year growth for the sector?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Well, I would say a couple of things about K-12. It's really important to understand that what was happening here was a great focus on equity and access [ph] for students and student success. And therefore, schools were looking to get full holistic outcomes solutions to their schools with a lot of speed. And not a lot of providers could do that because they needed to get in the hands of the students quite quickly. And so when you look at the tremendous success our team had in K-12, it is because of the capabilities that they're able to bring together and literally get turnkey solutions to the schools in a timely fashion. And it's because of the relationships we have with our vendors to make sure we're getting a healthy proportion of the supply out there, which was really constrained. So I would say a couple of things. Number one, the timing, the seasonality was different because of the great urgency schools have. Number two, our execution was just extraordinary. And I want to say that loud and clear because our teams did an extraordinary job. We have some backlog going into the first quarter of the next year, which will certainly benefit us in the first quarter. And then one would expect that going into the back half of next year, we'll get back to more, I guess, normal seasonality in K-12. But it's a confluence of both the demand and our capabilities and an unbelievable execution by the team.\nTim Yang: Very helpful.\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. Thanks, Tim. I just want to add a little bit more color on Q4 and build on Chris' comments. I mean we did see extraordinary demand. And I think everybody knows we benefited from Census. But we also had that really large offering with Mississippi Department of Education that Chris talked about on previous earnings calls. Just to dimensionalize the magnitude of those two offerings. If you excluded those from Q4 results, we would have grown our average daily sales in the neighborhood of a 6% to 7% range. So even excluding those two big deals, we still had a meaningful contribution from the education part of the market.\nTim Yang: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Patrick Jackson [ph] on for Shannon. I wanted to ask what you're seeing during sort of the year from health care customers, as budgets continue to shift and customers focus on security and software spend, while also considering time lines for investment in virtual care solutions, as there seems to be heightened demand for new offerings, as you referenced in your work with the non-profit health care provider. Then I have a quick follow-up.\nChris Leahy: Yeah. I agree with everything you said there, so not to repeat it. I'd say what - we're pleased with the improvement in health care this past quarter and continuing to be encouraged by first quarter performance so far. The real wildcard with health care is budget. And more than any of the segments, I think that tied to the virus is successfully containing it. It impacts the healthcare segment. Long-term certainly, there is opportunity in vital and in virtual care and all the components of it. On the 2021, to me, it's going to be a bit of a wildcard year with health care because of the pandemic. They are really just fluctuating back and forth between the urgent care, reductions in elective care, their revenue streams, et cetera. So we'll just have to see how it plays out in 2021, but the areas that you've identified yet are areas that they are focused on.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. And then you also referenced customers spent $2 billion with the company on security during 2020. I just wanted to ask where you're seeing security investments primarily being targeted. And do you expect securities spend to grow faster than the total IT market in 2021? Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, sure. Security is across the full stack. So from the hybrid infrastructure, all the way out to the digital experience and endpoint devices. So we're seeing it across the full stack hardware and software in particular. We certainly provide some services reps around those, but it's across the full stack. Right now, given the remote enablement going on, there is I would say, increased focus on endpoint devices and all things endpoint security. But that's not to diminish the security focus on the full data center as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thanks. And good morning. Chris, I wanted to ask concerning your comments about work from home and remote working and working from everywhere, as you put it. Obviously, we've seen a very strong first wave of investments. But we're hearing from other solution providers about a potential second wave as customers go back and upgrade the hardware, but also infrastructure, as you said, endpoints and then also security. Are you having those conversations with customers yet? And are you working with customers and see that as an opportunity?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Matt, yes, we are. And again, I'd say there are different flavors of what customers are doing. We have a healthy dose of customers who are - and someone like CDW, not so much waiting, seeing, but planning in a very flexible, adaptable optionality type kind of way. So they're not clear on whether they are going back at the end of the year or whether they are going to go back 50% et cetera. So I guess what I'm saying is we've got customers some who already are back in the office, may be 20% of our customers and we've obviously helping them setup in the office et cetera. But others are still planning for what their workforce ought to look like. I mean, I'm sure you hear the types of things that companies are saying they need to be in-person for now - collaboration, innovation, acculturation, these are things companies are saying, we need to be in the office for that. So we're helping them to design spaces that are more suitable for that. If in fact customers decide 80% of the workforce can work from anywhere, we are absolutely and necessarily talking with them about what the blueprint for that looks like in terms of 80% work, 20% in the office or alternatively kind of a different kind of office environment where everybody is coming into the office at different times for different types of work. I mean, it's a really interesting time right now because I don't - well, while there was a lot of talk about where this would settle out, the hard work really begins in the planning and what that looks like and how you create efficiency and productivity for your workforce. And we're right in the throes of that. And I think we're going to see a number of flavors, frankly. So we'll be - we're helping customers with all kinds of flavors.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thanks for that. And I wanted to ask another question regarding client devices. I know you talked about the double-digit strength across most of your end markets. Last year, we've seen a strong PC upgrade cycle for going on three-years now. How should we be thinking about that number this year, particularly both on the Corporate side and in the Public sector?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. I think, look, with client devices, look, we have some headwinds and some tailwinds certainly going into 2021. And you named one of them. I mean, refresh is something that might be on our side. We've talked about devices that were from 2017, 2018. Also the need for more devices depending on where organizations end up in terms of long-term remote and bolstering those and refreshing those at some point, extending those. New use cases, we've been talking about this for quite a long time as companies are evolving their business models, think retailers, for example, contactless purchasing. We think new use cases will be a tailwind for client devices. And again, thinking about what comes in from the stimulus package that will be really interesting to see how our state and local education health care organizations can take advantage of it. Look, for CDW, we've got some big overlaps, we've talked about that we'll have to overcome, and we'll have to keep an eye on the economy and employment. But look, there are - again, there are winners out there who are hiring and investing heavily in technology. And that's a positive also for client devices.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. Regarding the comment about the security software, $2 billion in customer spending. Is that a gross number or netted-down number?\nChris Leahy: That's a gross number. That's customer spend. So that's what customers spend with us.\nMatt Sheerin: And that's really what you recognized because of the netted-down, right?\nCollin Kebo: No, no, no. The gross is what customers are spending with us. We're recognizing fewer dollars in that in revenue because a lot of that is getting netted-down because it's software assurance and Software as a Service.\nMatt Sheerin: Exactly. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nCollin Kebo: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Trevor filling in for Keith. How broad were the supply chain constraints across the portfolio? Were Chromebooks the only products affected? Or were there others?\nCollin Kebo: Chromebooks were the primary area of constraints. We did see some tightness in some of the other lower end notebooks and continue to see, I would say, pockets of dislocation on collaboration of hardware, webcams and things like that. But I would say those things are - were gradually getting better, but Chromebooks by far were the biggest source of constraints.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. And a quick follow-up. Would you say the supply chain issues during the quarter got better or got worse as the quarter progress?\nCollin Kebo: I would say that's a difficult question to answer because we were chasing a moving target. And what I mean by that is, I think we were pleasantly surprised by our ability to procure supply in Chromebooks. We were also pleasantly surprised by the amount of demand. So on an absolute basis, I think the supply was a little bit better, but it still came in short of what demand was because demand was just so much than expected.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, and congrats on the quarter.\nCollin Kebo: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there are no questions. I would now like to hand the call back over to Chris Leahy, President and CEO.\nChris Leahy: Thank you. And thank you all. I want to recognize before we head off the tremendous, tremendous dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all of CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. And thank you to our investors and analysts participating in this call. We appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of fourth quarter and full-year results and drivers of performance and share some thoughts on 2021. Collin will take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $5 billion, 11% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of one fewer business day in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019 and up 10.7% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 13.3% to $881 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $376 million, an increase of 9.9%. Our non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, 16.1% above last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant currency. For the year, net sales were $18.5 billion, up nearly $0.5 billion year-over-year or 2.4% on a reported and constant currency basis. Gross profit increased 5.6% to $3.2 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 2.6% to $1.4 billion and non-GAAP net income per share increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis to $6.59. 2020 was an extraordinary year. I am very proud of how the CDW team quickly and smartly adapted to help our customers and partners during a challenging time. The diversity of our solutions portfolio and customer end markets served us well in 2020, providing balance and driving our exceptional results. During the year, our team helped customers across the full IT solution stack in the full IT life cycle from client devices to cloud from design to managed services. We executed against our strategy and continued to invest in high growth solutions and services capabilities, including three acquisitions, IGNW, a leading provider of cloud-native service expertise and software development capabilities, and - excuse me, and Southern Dakota Solutions, which expanded our ServiceNow team. Performance for our customer end markets varied. Demand increased in some and decreased in others, but all experienced change or disruption to their technology needs and to their operations last year due to COVID-19. Our value proposition resonated with customers. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and logistical and distribution capabilities to deliver the best outcomes for our customers. This led to meaningful outperformance compared to the US IT market. We emerged from 2020 stronger and even more committed to executing our strategy. Turning to the fourth quarter. We continue to help customers with remote enablement and resource optimization, cost reduction, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. Similar to the third quarter, some customers resumed solutions projects and others started new projects. Performance for our most impacted customer end markets improved, and trends for our more resilient customer end markets remained strong. During the fourth quarter, we continued to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges and support our customers, in particular, for Chromebooks for K-12 customers where demand greatly outstrip supply. Now let's take a deeper look at fourth quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 11% with similar levels of performance for transactions and solutions. In total, there was improvement versus the last two quarters. Customer spend for corporate customers is not uniform. Some customers were doing well and investing in technology, whereas other customers, those who are in challenged industries or geographies who were impacted by spikes and COVID cases were still cautious. Small Business declined mid-single digits, as notebooks returned to growth. Small Business customers tend to be more nimble than corporate customers, which drove the improvement versus the third quarter. The Government team increased net sales 30%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up strong double-digits. During the quarter, our Device as a Service solution for the US Census Bureau was mostly completed. All devices were returned to us for decommissioning, and we started the process to resell the clean units through third-party re-marketers. Our team did an excellent job with this program. It was a multi-year effort to develop and execute this large complex undertaking, moving the nation's once-a-decade population count from paper to digital for the first time. Our services and logistical capabilities and multi-vendor solutions set us apart from the competition. We are unique in what we can deliver to our customers. Outside of the Census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies with remote enablement and device refresh. We also delivered on Department of Defense projects that were awarded at the end of the third quarter. The state and local team delivered strong double-digit growth. IT investments continued to be a priority despite budget pressure. Our team helped customers enable remote capabilities and restart solution projects. Education increased in extraordinary 140%, driven by phenomenal growth in K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access and remote learning, which drove triple-digit growth for notebooks, related accessories and solutions, as customers turn to us for holistic capabilities. Higher education increased low double digits, as schools continued to help students with remote enablement and resumed net comp projects with a focus on creating connected communities to enhance the student experience. Healthcare declined mid-teens, a meaningful improvement compared to the third quarter. Customers continued to be cautious with their spend due to ongoing budget pressure, focusing on key areas like remote enablement, telehealth and support infrastructure. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations was flat on a reported basis. UK net sales increased mid-single digits in constant currency, and Canada net sales decreased low double digits in constant currency. Performance for both markets was driven by strong education demand to enable remote learning and health care spending to address the pandemic, with softer corporate performance. In the UK, there was some pull-in up customer demand before the announcement of the agreement with the EU, as customers prepared for a potential hard exit [ph] Over the last several weeks, the UK team has executed against its well-planned Brexit mitigation strategy and has done a great job helping customers navigate through the complexity of the new agreement. Our fourth quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers across all categories. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth, in particular for our public segment customers, leading to over 30% client device growth. While software was flat, software gross profit increased mid-teens, reflecting continued growth into Software-as-a-Service. Services grew low double digits, driven by device decommission services for the Census project and configuration services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. Transactions increased strong double digits. Solutions declined low single digits, as some customers continued to restore infrastructure and larger project engagement. The team delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in collaboration, infrastructure as a service, security and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue. Let me also share a little more color on our security practice, given its importance to our customers, as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double digits, as customers improved their security framework to respond to increasing threat. Last year, customers spent $2 billion with us on security. Our fourth quarter and full year operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy. They are important drivers of our path and our future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customer's total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I've shared, the balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in current environment. And the final driver of our performance, our three-part strategy for growth is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share, second, enhance our solutions capabilities, and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy and action and how we helped customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped the born-in-the-cloud financial technology company add more agility and flexibility to its operations and technology stack by becoming multi-cloud. The customer initially came to our team requesting help to implement a backup solution for its existing public cloud provider. After a review by our Digital Velocity team, our team uncovered the need for the customer to become multi-cloud with additional capabilities and redundancies. Our team helped the customer build a secure second public cloud environment and address additional needs, including application development, functionality and consumption management. Our team has established CDW as a trusted partner with expensive cloud capabilities to help with research, evaluation, procurement, implementation and management. Our customers are increasingly adopting cloud but are also finding a growing need to become multi-cloud. CDW's cloud expertise and cloud management platform across the multi public clouds are a differentiator in the marketplace. Let me share another story in health care sector. To address COVID, health care customers have turned to CDW to provide care in new settings and in new ways. An independent non-profit health care provider in the US Northeast needed our guidance to enable remote COVID testing and vaccine distribution in numerous outdoor locations. The CDW account manager engaged one of our networking specialists to develop a solution that would deliver the required performance and scale quickly. The solution has since been rolled out to all locations and in next work with the customer on the site's wireless connectivity further leveraging our technical resources and strengthening their relationship. Our team saved the customer time and energy and provided great service as a forward-thinking partner that the customer can trust. The pandemic has created new issues requiring creative solutions and leading customers to rely on us more than ever as an extension of their team. This is the value that CDW brings to our customers. We pair our broad solutions portfolio with our deep technical expertise to deliver the full outcomes that customers need. Finally, the digital divide has created significant learning challenges around the world. Our teams have worked closely with education customers in the US, in the UK and in Canada to tackle this challenge. In the UK, we are working with the London Grid for Learning, a charitable trust dedicated to the advancement of education to provide technology for hundreds of schools across the country. Last quarter, our team developed and provisioned unique turnkey solutions comprised of client devices, accessories, software and services, leveraging our strong logistical and distribution capabilities and deep vendor relationships. There has been tight collaboration with our clients' vendor partner to provide the best possible device availability for the customer due to the current global Chromebook's buy constraint. Our distribution center in the UK has done a tremendous job to deliver over 100,000 units to date to hundreds of schools. CDW is uniquely positioned to deliver for our customers and our vendor partners. This is a great example of our critical role. These examples highlight CDW's three-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the success of investments in cloud, our strong relationships with customers and vendors and the importance of our competitive advantages. I am proud of the way our team continues to deliver. Let me briefly update you now on our COVID response efforts. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have followed three key principles: First, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers, second, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers, and third, support our communities. I'm proud of how the team has managed the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Teams at our distribution and configuration centers have done an outstanding job, maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while adhering to new protocols that safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers who come to work every day. We've also taken deliberate actions to foster collaboration and coworker engagement and to maintain connectivity and productivity to preserve and bolster our culture, even while we are distant. These actions include leveraging new tools and learning and development opportunities, expanded health and well-being programs, increased content from our business resource groups and compensation investment to recognize the team's tremendous efforts and performance. Now let me share some thoughts on 2021. The near-term global health and macroeconomic environment is still uncertain. Our current outlook is for the US IT market to return to growth and grow between 2.5% and 3%. As you know, we hold ourselves accountable for growing faster than the IT market, and we expect our topline in 2021 to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. There are many wildcards, though, including COVID-19 government restrictions and vaccine rollout; policies from the new administration, including stimulus programs and tax changes, and supply constraints, in particular, for Chromebooks. We are encouraged about our Q1 performance to date and how our teams are executing, but we are also cautious about the macro environment. Even though uncertainty continues, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Last year, we went through our rigorous strategic planning process, as we do every three years, and we are now accelerating investment and execution against it. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, to enhance our competitive position and to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. This confidence has led our Board of Directors to increase our share repurchase authorization by $1.25 billion. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives; and of course, out-execute the competition. Now, Colin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin? Sure. Thanks, Ruplu. Thanks for being on the call. Yeah, we always hold ourselves accountable for outperforming the market. So on a relative basis, we always expect ourselves to do better. And when you think about the combination of our competitive advantages, you saw them in play really in one of the hardest periods in history in 2020. So we are confident that the advantages that we bring to the market will position us and allow us to continue to outperform a pivot to where our customers need us and grow faster than the market. When I think about headwinds and tailwinds going into 2020, certainly, think about remote work and remote everything. And that has certainly been driving growth in 2020 and should continue to do so into 2021. That we've got some very significant compares, as you all know, because of the first quarter of last year, because of the timing of the education needs the end of this past year in Census. But it will still continue to be a trend, we believe. Everyone will not be going to straight back to work, and we think it will be a work-from-everywhere kind of situation. We also believe that this digital acceleration is just going to continue. And so our strength across the full stack, and when I say full stack, I mean, cloud services, software and hardware plays very well with our customers because customers are always full stack, and they're looking for a full solution. So as they think about combined multi-vendor, multi component solutions, CDW is a great partner for them. And we can take them from the very front end of advising and designing to building, implementing, integrating, orchestrating and managing. And I'll tell you, it seems that 2020 has really propelled customers to look for that value-added one-stop shop trusted IT provider that can do the full spectrum across the whole life cycle. So, we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our customers. On the federal side, I think you asked about specifically the Department of Defense and Civilian, we expect to continue to maintain pretty strong. Look, on the commercial side on Small Business and Corporate, I'll tell you as Colin said, the speed and the slope of any recovery is tied to confidence, which is tied to the macro, which is tied to the virus. It's all tied together. So that's very hard to predict. But we've been staying so close to our customers during 2020 that we feel absolutely confident that we will be well-positioned to help them on their way up and to capture growth as they're growing. On the Government side, stimulus is another wildcard out there. And under the new administration, if we see some stronger stimulus, that should also help to support on the education, healthcare and state and local side. Yeah, sure. In the UK, I'll tell you, I mentioned that we saw a little bit of buy ahead as people - as customers were anticipating possibly a hard Brexit. So we saw some benefit in the fourth quarter. But the good news Ruplu, remember, we put the mitigation strategy in place with our Netherlands entity, and we've really been helping customers utilize that entity in the EU. So while we've gone back into lockdown, it does feel like - it feels like customers are used to working that way and are still buying in the areas where they have needs, like remote work - optimizing remote work, et cetera. So we haven't seen a significant impact any different than we would have seen in 2020. And we're managing this really quite well at this point. In terms of M&A, yeah, look, we never really pinpoint where we're going to be - what we're going to be doing, but you know we're focused on geographic expansion, as well as expanding our capabilities, our technology capabilities. So, we continue to look. We continue to be very active. I doubt there's a deal out there that doesn't get to CDW store to see, but we also have our screens that we need to adhere to, which are - the cultural and operating match, the financial match and the strategic match. So we'll continue to look. We're excited about this [indiscernible] we did this year that continue to grow our cloud native and ServiceNow capabilities. And frankly, we're seeing the real benefit from those in terms of traction with our sales organization and deeper connections with our customers because we're really at the front end of that IT supply chain, if you will, helping them to devise solutions and then fulfilling. So those have been real positive winners for CDW and our customers. Thank you. Yeah, good morning. It's really interesting - rather, I'm sorry, it's really interesting. I would tell you that 2021 is almost a harder year to determine what sits underneath that IT market rate of growth. There's a wide dispersion of forecast out there across various technologies. And what I would say is, I don't think anybody really knows precisely. What we plan to do is what we do best, which is pivot where our customers need us. And whether that be in the client hardware, refresh area, whether it be in building out cloud capabilities, we're able to go in either direction. And we're just staying very close to our customers working with them literally day-by-day, week-by-week and supporting them in their technology needs. Certainly, technology is more essential than ever. We don't see any of the trends slowing down, frankly. We might see some things prolonged as a result of the pandemic, and the vaccine don't go as we all hope. But at the end of the day, it's a mix, and it's really quite hard to tell. I know that's not a great answer to the question of what it comprises, but it's very hard to know given the unprecedented uncertainty that we still have. I think sometimes, I think people felt in some ways we've come through 2020, and now we're in 2021. And it's sunrise and glory ahead. And I think we really have to be cautious and conscious of where we sit in the vaccine rollout and new strains coming up, and we just have to be very methodical in listening to our customers and taking care of them, which we're very good at doing. Yeah. On the first question, Amit, I'd say both. We are - you know, we certainly mean more heavily into penetrating current customers as you saw, but we are bringing in new customers with our cloud capabilities and our Digital Velocity and ServiceNow processes in particular. Again, as I mentioned earlier, they're really at the front end of that discussion advisory. And that's where we're able to bring a great deal of value to the customer and the planning, particularly in a world where things are changing so quickly and plans that had been expected and in place four, five, 12 months ago are moving, and we're very well-positioned to help them with that. So it's both customers, new and existing. And we do expect to continue to see growth there. I would note that on the - you asked about existing customers and migrating to the cloud. One of the interesting things that I know you're aware of, that it's not just migrating to the cloud, but it's also some customers who are already cloud and becoming multi-cloud. So multi public cloud, other customers who are - have some public cloud capabilities that they need to almost mirror that on-prem. So it's the whole - I'll call it the cloud environment, the whole ecosystem that our teams are able to support customers with now. Again, which is a real advantage because it's bringing the customer the best for the customer and not just some narrow product category that we sell. In terms of the impact on the P&L, I think Collin is going to jump in here. Sure. Good morning, Adam. Yes, let me step back on the strategic process. You know, we do this every three years. And our overarching strategy hasn't changed, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. I would say what we do is we really hone where we're focusing our energy and investments to evolve the business, as technology evolves. And where we're focusing now, are those areas in strategic services and solutions that our customers need. You heard me mention full stack is a way that we go to market. And investments in the capabilities across that full stack, such as cloud solutions, cloud services, software solutions and services, in particular, security and then obviously, our hardware. I think about a couple of recent acquisitions, Scalar, and IGNW, as excellent examples of that strategy in action where we invested in cloud and DevOps capabilities and ServiceNow capabilities, and those are the areas that customers are needing advisers. The other area that you can think about that we're investing in is our talent and digital in particular. So our technology, our own technology, we kind of put the mirror on ourselves and made some decisions about what we need as an organization. And we're investing in our own technical capabilities, but also those digital tools that we've talked about in the past for sellers. I think you've heard us talk about AMANDA [ph] We have a number of other tools in the pipeline that allow our sellers in our digital platform, our e-commerce platform to work for our customer in a really integrated, seamless intelligent way. And that's what we're going for. And then obviously, we're also reviewing our operating model as we always do, but even what was more custom-wide, I'd say now to really remove those things that we - that are inefficiencies and recoup where we can and then re-imagine critical elements for a digital world and then reinvest back in the business. So investing in technology, also investing in talent. We talked last quarter about a reduction in our workforce, but a reduction was also to open up capacity for those rules and capabilities that we need, and we have been investing in people there. So technology, people and digital is where you see the investment, as well as capabilities behind those high growth areas. Yeah. Good morning, Matt. Yeah, I'll go back to the comments I made earlier, which is, it's hard to know the timing and slope of when we might see server storage in particular pickup. For example, in the Corporate space, we think about timing around when customers are really getting back to the office, which probably won't be through the second half of the year. We are seeing some pickup in areas like higher Ed as example, where they're really focused on a connected community. So they've really extended what that connected campus looks like. But until we start to see, I think a strength in recovery, which, of course, is related to the virus, we're pretty cautious around on-prem solutions. We also haven't obviously been able to get into locations. We still haven't been able to get into too many locations to help our customers there. So I would just say, look, a refresh will be coming. It's hard to know when in 2021 or beyond that will be. Yeah. Matt, I think, you know, and we said this before Small Businesses just tend to be more nimble. And so at the beginning of 2021 - 2020, excuse me, they went - they slowed down more quickly and they've come back up more quickly. So I think that's just the nature of Small Businesses. On the Corporate side, it's really - we referenced it as kind of multiple layers and mosaics, and it's to say that we're really seeing the same thing. It depends by geography. It depends by industry, even individual customers within segments, winners and losers, so to speak. So it's really a mix across geo industry and individual customers. I will say that we did see some budget flush at the end of the year, which felt like a good thing. But again, until we see the macroeconomics uncertainty subside and we see more customer confidence, which, of course, is driven by the success in stemming the virus, I think we're still going to be a little cautious on Corporate. On the other hand, look, when things do normalize, we would expect Corporate and Small Business similar to what we saw in 2009 and '10 to really pick up again, and we'll be well-prepared to help them do that. Yes. No, these are great questions. I wish I had a better crystal ball to answer them. It's just hard to say, the unique dynamics of this downturn and the pandemic have really, I think, made it harder to predict and I think less comparable to what we saw in 2008, '09 and '10. And as Collin said in his prepared remarks, the speed and the slope of the recovery is really in every way related to the success containing the virus. So if we can get that under control and we can stem the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and I think we'll see it recover more quickly and maybe with a very healthy slope given the importance of technology. If we don't see that, I think we're going to see more muted growth over a longer period of time. Certainly, the stimulus is yet another wildcard, which can help in the areas that we've mentioned, education, state and local, et cetera, and can of course help get that positive momentum going with the consumer, which ultimately impacts the businesses. But I just think the dynamics of this environment and the pandemic make it incredibly difficult to predict timing and flow. Again, the beautiful thing is the diversity of our end markets allows us to make sure that we are where the growth is and able to support our customers wherever they need us better than anyone. Yes. Well, I would say a couple of things about K-12. It's really important to understand that what was happening here was a great focus on equity and access [ph] for students and student success. And therefore, schools were looking to get full holistic outcomes solutions to their schools with a lot of speed. And not a lot of providers could do that because they needed to get in the hands of the students quite quickly. And so when you look at the tremendous success our team had in K-12, it is because of the capabilities that they're able to bring together and literally get turnkey solutions to the schools in a timely fashion. And it's because of the relationships we have with our vendors to make sure we're getting a healthy proportion of the supply out there, which was really constrained. So I would say a couple of things. Number one, the timing, the seasonality was different because of the great urgency schools have. Number two, our execution was just extraordinary. And I want to say that loud and clear because our teams did an extraordinary job. We have some backlog going into the first quarter of the next year, which will certainly benefit us in the first quarter. And then one would expect that going into the back half of next year, we'll get back to more, I guess, normal seasonality in K-12. But it's a confluence of both the demand and our capabilities and an unbelievable execution by the team. Yeah. I agree with everything you said there, so not to repeat it. I'd say what - we're pleased with the improvement in health care this past quarter and continuing to be encouraged by first quarter performance so far. The real wildcard with health care is budget. And more than any of the segments, I think that tied to the virus is successfully containing it. It impacts the healthcare segment. Long-term certainly, there is opportunity in vital and in virtual care and all the components of it. On the 2021, to me, it's going to be a bit of a wildcard year with health care because of the pandemic. They are really just fluctuating back and forth between the urgent care, reductions in elective care, their revenue streams, et cetera. So we'll just have to see how it plays out in 2021, but the areas that you've identified yet are areas that they are focused on. Yeah, sure. Security is across the full stack. So from the hybrid infrastructure, all the way out to the digital experience and endpoint devices. So we're seeing it across the full stack hardware and software in particular. We certainly provide some services reps around those, but it's across the full stack. Right now, given the remote enablement going on, there is I would say, increased focus on endpoint devices and all things endpoint security. But that's not to diminish the security focus on the full data center as well. Yeah. Yes. Matt, yes, we are. And again, I'd say there are different flavors of what customers are doing. We have a healthy dose of customers who are - and someone like CDW, not so much waiting, seeing, but planning in a very flexible, adaptable optionality type kind of way. So they're not clear on whether they are going back at the end of the year or whether they are going to go back 50% et cetera. So I guess what I'm saying is we've got customers some who already are back in the office, may be 20% of our customers and we've obviously helping them setup in the office et cetera. But others are still planning for what their workforce ought to look like. I mean, I'm sure you hear the types of things that companies are saying they need to be in-person for now - collaboration, innovation, acculturation, these are things companies are saying, we need to be in the office for that. So we're helping them to design spaces that are more suitable for that. If in fact customers decide 80% of the workforce can work from anywhere, we are absolutely and necessarily talking with them about what the blueprint for that looks like in terms of 80% work, 20% in the office or alternatively kind of a different kind of office environment where everybody is coming into the office at different times for different types of work. I mean, it's a really interesting time right now because I don't - well, while there was a lot of talk about where this would settle out, the hard work really begins in the planning and what that looks like and how you create efficiency and productivity for your workforce. And we're right in the throes of that. And I think we're going to see a number of flavors, frankly. So we'll be - we're helping customers with all kinds of flavors. Yeah. I think, look, with client devices, look, we have some headwinds and some tailwinds certainly going into 2021. And you named one of them. I mean, refresh is something that might be on our side. We've talked about devices that were from 2017, 2018. Also the need for more devices depending on where organizations end up in terms of long-term remote and bolstering those and refreshing those at some point, extending those. New use cases, we've been talking about this for quite a long time as companies are evolving their business models, think retailers, for example, contactless purchasing. We think new use cases will be a tailwind for client devices. And again, thinking about what comes in from the stimulus package that will be really interesting to see how our state and local education health care organizations can take advantage of it. Look, for CDW, we've got some big overlaps, we've talked about that we'll have to overcome, and we'll have to keep an eye on the economy and employment. But look, there are - again, there are winners out there who are hiring and investing heavily in technology. And that's a positive also for client devices. That's a gross number. That's customer spend. So that's what customers spend with us. Thank you. And thank you all. I want to recognize before we head off the tremendous, tremendous dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all of CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. And thank you to our investors and analysts participating in this call. We appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Take care."

            "name": "Collin Kebo",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full year results, capital allocation priorities and initial thoughts on 2021. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on slide nine. Consolidated net sales were $5 billion, up 9.2% on a reported basis and 11% on an average daily sales basis as we had one less selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 7.6% versus the third quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality of a mid-single digit decline, primarily due to how COVID-19 is impacting our channels differently. During this uncertain time, seasonality has been and is expected to continue to be, different than historical experience. Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand writings commentary shared on our last earnings call other than K-12, where demand was even stronger than expected. Pockets of supply constraints continued in the quarter, primarily for lower end client devices such as Chromebooks. Our team did a great job navigating the fluid environment and leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure a healthy share of supply for customers. Gross profit for the quarter was $881 million, an increase of 13.3%. Gross margin was 17.8%, up 70 basis points over last year. The gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Turning to SG&A on slide 10. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 15.9%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs due to higher gross profit and compensation investments in our coworkers to recognize and reward their tremendous efforts and performance in 2020. The acquisition of IGNW, an ongoing investment in Aptris, and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline coworkers, partially offset by continued cost savings measures, including decreased travel and entertainment. Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was 9,982, up two from the third quarter. Year-over-year, coworker count increased 86, driven by an increase of approximately 150 customer-facing coworkers, including IGNW, partially offset by a decrease in non-customer-facing coworker count. GAAP operating income was $332 million, up 17.1%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $376 million, up 9.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%. Moving to slide 11. Interest expense was $37 million, down 2.9%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from the August refinancing. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 12 was 19.2%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $57 million compared to $50 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.2%, down 150 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to tax benefits associated with new regulations for global intangible low tax income and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by lower tax credits. As you can see on slide 14, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.65, up 29.6%. Our non-GAAP net income was $264 million in the quarter, up 15%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.82, up 16.1% from last year. Turning to our full year results on slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $18.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. Gross profit was $3.2 billion, up 5.6%. Gross profit margin was 17.4%, up 50 basis points, driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to put 2020 sales and gross profit in context. We have consistently highlighted the power of our diverse portfolio and customer end markets. We pivot to where the growth is, leveraging our competitive advantages to better serve customers and gain share. In 2020, we estimate the US IT market declined low single digits, call it down 2%. CDW net sales grew 440 basis points faster and gross profit grew 760 basis points faster than the 2% market decline. Census contributed 170 basis points of year-over-year net sales growth. Excluding the Census, CDW still delivered meaningful net sales and gross profit growth in excess of market. During the 2009 recession, our net sales premium narrowed as customers paused on hardware purchases, and gross profit margin compressed due to product margin pressure in the competitive environment. In 2020, our portfolio performed differently, partially because of the unique dynamics of the pandemic, but also because of the progress we've made building out the solution and services capabilities our customers value. For example, while US software and services collectively totaled 18% of US net sales in 2020, they accounted for approximately 40% of US gross profit. Returning to the full year P&L. Operating income was $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, up 2.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, down 120 basis points versus last year's rate. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to new regulations for global intangible low tax income and non-deductible expenses that are not expected to contribute as much of a benefit to the tax rate in 2021. Net income was $789 million and non-GAAP net income was $954 million, up 5.8%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $6.59, up 8%. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 21. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion, and net debt was $2.5 billion. Liquidity further strengthened with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.5 billion. Full year free cash flow was $1.2 billion, as shown on slide 22, this equates to 6.7% of sales, well above our historical free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25%. A portion of the outperformance was driven by timing or one-time items, including mixing into vendors with extended payment terms, the Census, deferred payroll and UK tax payments and the timing of collections from some large customers. We expect the favorable timing to reverse over the next few quarters. Moving to slide 23. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down one day from last year's fourth quarter. DSO and DIO were unchanged from last year, while DPO increased by one day. The increase in DPO was primarily driven by mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. As previously mentioned, we resumed our share buyback program in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of stock. For full year 2020, we returned $561 million to shareholders, including $220 million of dividends and $341 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $129 per share. Turning to capital allocation priorities on slide 24. Given our strong liquidity position, our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times. We ended the year at 1.7 times. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we acquired two small ServiceNow solution practices to build on the success from our 2019 acquisition of Aptris. We remain active evaluating targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to move closer to our target net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. At the end of December, we had $338 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As Chris mentioned, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.25 billion increase to the share repurchase program in support of our capital allocation priorities. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on slide 25. The current environment continues to be highly uncertain, making it challenging to forecast expectations for IT market growth with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, we are providing a base case for 2021 IT market growth and how we expect CDW's business to perform in that environment. Our base case assumes US IT market growth between 2.5% to 3%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 200 to 300 basis points faster than market. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 50 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. In terms of performance by segment for the year, there continues to be uncertainty among customers across end markets, but here are some drivers to consider. On the commercial side of the business, Corporate and Small Business customers tend to respond quicker to the macroeconomic environment. We saw that last year, Q1 was the strongest quarter, then Q2 experienced the steepest decline with quarterly declines moderating thereafter. We expect the timing and slope of the rebound in 2021 to be closely tied to customer confidence, which will be a function of the macroeconomic environment and success containing the virus. Moving to Public. We expect continued success supporting Department of Defense and civilian agencies. However, Government is not expected to fully make up the loss of the Census project, which contributed a total of approximately 230 basis points of net sales to CDW in 2020. Education growth is expected to be strong earlier in the year, with sales above historical seasonality and then decelerate throughout the year due to overlaps in the unusual seasonality experienced in 2020. Chromebook supply continued to be a wildcard. Healthcare overlaps are tougher in the first half as customer demand spiked at the beginning of the pandemic and then comparison feeds in the second half. The timing and slope of a rebound in 2021 is linked to budget clarity, which we expect to be a function of success containing the virus and potential stimulus support. Finally, our international businesses are more weighted to Corporate customers, so the pace of recovery will be driven by the macro environments in the UK and Canada. Moving down the P&L. Assuming IT market growth of 2.5% to 3%, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range and non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid to high single digits, call it 6.5% to 7% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the following below the operating line assumptions. One, a modest decline in interest expense to the mid to high 140s, two, a non-GAAP effective tax rate at the low-end of our typical 25.5% to 26.5% range, assuming current tax rates. The low end of the range is approximately 150 basis points higher than 2020's 24% rate, creating a headwind of over 200 basis points on earnings per share growth. Three, contribution from share repurchases with non-GAAP earnings per share growing approximately 200 basis points faster than non-GAAP net income. Currency is expected to contribute approximately 40 basis points to reported earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization can be found on page 26. Turning to the first quarter. Historically, the Q4 to Q1 sequential decline on an average daily sales basis has averaged down approximately 7%. We expect this year's first quarter sequential decline to be down high single digits more than historical seasonality, primarily due to Census and Mississippi Department of Education. On a year-over-year average daily sales basis, this equates to mid-single digit growth, reflecting continued education and government strength, improving commercial trends, partially offset by the overlap of the March 2020 work-from-home surge. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be a couple of hundred basis points higher than the full year EPS outlook, as we overlap last year's increase in the credit loss reserve, partially offset by having one fewer selling day, which adversely impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points. This is timing, and we will recoup the day in the fourth quarter. January segment trends are generally in line with my commentary on first quarter expectations. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on slide 27. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged to 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. We expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. We believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cree to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each one of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you. Hi, Katy. Good morning. We did carry a higher backlog than normal out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter. In terms of when we expect supply conditions to get better, obviously, very difficult and fluid to call with any precision. But our expectation would be through the course of the first half of the year, we would see supply on the Chromebook side of the business begin to return to normal. Yeah. I mean, you're right. There is a little bit of a give back on the sales comp line because we pay on gross profit dollars. I think, Katy, from a secular perspective, our expectation is consistent with yours that we would expect netted-down items in software and services to grow faster than the balance of the business. I think we're just a little careful though of trying to understand where we are in the cycle and whether a hardware refresh is coming and if it is coming, how strong it could be. So I think that's something to keep in mind as you think about that netted-down mix and the impact it has on gross margin going forward, at least over the next several quarters. I think the other thing to think through on the margin and then the flow-through to NGOI margin is we did benefit from really an exceptional product margin in 2020. And I think some of that was due to the unique dynamics of the supply environment, as well as the premium that customers were placing on speed. And so I think that's just also another thing to keep in mind as we think about gross margin going forward. And I think those are probably more secular - cyclical than secular, but something to think about. Thank you. Yeah. Good morning, Amit. I mean, because most of it gets netted down, it obviously has the lift on gross margin and operating margin. I think if you look at it on gross profit divided by what the customer is actually spending, I would say cloud is very much like our entire portfolio. There are some things in it that are higher margin. Security would be a good example of that. A lot of it's delivered via the cloud. And there are other things that are more commodity like in terms of cloud offerings and would have lower margins. So, in terms of the absolute amount of profit, it's really a function of how margin-rich the particular offering is, which is typically rooted in value from the - perceived value from the customer, as well as then the services that we can wrap around at another value we can bring by consumption. Yeah. Adam, we elected not to provide thoughts on that, just given the highly uncertain environment, both on the demand and the supply side, frankly. I mean, some of my comments in the prepared remarks were slope of recovery tied to economy and virus, which I think is inherently uncertain and the supply environment is uncertain. So at this point, no perspective on that. Obviously, when we get on the call next quarter, we can provide more thoughts on that. Yeah. Thanks, Tim. I just want to add a little bit more color on Q4 and build on Chris' comments. I mean we did see extraordinary demand. And I think everybody knows we benefited from Census. But we also had that really large offering with Mississippi Department of Education that Chris talked about on previous earnings calls. Just to dimensionalize the magnitude of those two offerings. If you excluded those from Q4 results, we would have grown our average daily sales in the neighborhood of a 6% to 7% range. So even excluding those two big deals, we still had a meaningful contribution from the education part of the market. No, no, no. The gross is what customers are spending with us. We're recognizing fewer dollars in that in revenue because a lot of that is getting netted-down because it's software assurance and Software as a Service. Okay. Chromebooks were the primary area of constraints. We did see some tightness in some of the other lower end notebooks and continue to see, I would say, pockets of dislocation on collaboration of hardware, webcams and things like that. But I would say those things are - were gradually getting better, but Chromebooks by far were the biggest source of constraints. I would say that's a difficult question to answer because we were chasing a moving target. And what I mean by that is, I think we were pleasantly surprised by our ability to procure supply in Chromebooks. We were also pleasantly surprised by the amount of demand. So on an absolute basis, I think the supply was a little bit better, but it still came in short of what demand was because demand was just so much than expected. Thank you."

With that, I may turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of third quarter results and drivers of performance. I'll provide our perspectives on the current macro environment, its impact on our customer end market and how we are responding. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We'll move quickly through the prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.  For the third quarter net sales were $4.8 billion, 3.1% below last year and down 3.3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $386 million, an increase of 1.5%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.83, 8% above last year on a reported basis and up 7.7% in constant currency. The quarter demonstrated the balance and strength of CDW's business model. The diversity of our customer end markets served as well. For our most impacted customer end market the rate of decline stabilized and generally improved in the quarter. Trends for a more resilient customer end markets continue to be strong.  Our value proposition really resonated with customers this quarter. There was a flight to quality as customers start to de-risk projects in their technology investments. Our teams are trusted strategic partners to our customers. We compete on value and advice, not on the price. We helped customers this quarter across a spectrum of IP priorities. Customers were focused on remote enablement, optimization, cost reduction, security, and leveraging technology for better customer and employee engagement through digital transformation, with an increasing focus on cloud. Customer demand for software-as-a-service increased almost 50% quarter-over-quarter. Customers leveraged our cloud solutions capabilities further bolstered by our acquisition of IGNW at the beginning of the quarter. Our solutions business strengthened this quarter as some customers resumed projects that had been put on hold earlier in the year and others started new projects.  During the third quarter, we continue to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. We successfully secured supply in high demand categories and managed to longer lead times for others. Now let's take a deeper look at the customer end market performance. Corporate declined 13%, markedly better than May and June. Solutions strengthened increasing low single digits year-over-year. The significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in solutions reflected customers restarting infrastructure and project engagement. Transactional projects were down double digit as spending on remote enablement moderated. Small Business also declined 13%, a considerable improvement versus the second quarter. Most product categories declined less this quarter as small business customers remained focused on remote enablement, security, cost management, and optimization.  The government team increased net sales high single digit. Federal delivered another strong quarter with net sales up mid-single digits. During the quarter our device-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau contributed less incremental growth than other quarters since the majority of last year's revenue was recognized in the third quarter. We are in the final phase of the project. Data collection has ended and devices are returning to us for decommissioning. Our team has done an excellent job navigating the complexity of this program from the very start.  Outside of the census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies to promote enablement and device refresh. Some Department of Defense solution projects got pushed to future quarters dampening performance. The state and local team deliver high single-digit growth. IT investments continue to be a priority for public safety. In some cases budget was reallocated to support technology initiatives.  Our team helps customers enable remote capabilities, enhanced security and optimize technology assets. Education increased over 30% with excellent growth in both K-12 and Higher Ed. In K-12, customers continue to focus on equity and access for students. K-12 growth is driven by strong notebook results and related accessories, security and software as well as cloud solutions to support remote learning. Higher ed performance strengthen this quarter as schools turned to us to leverage our extensive logistics capability to optimize technology to teach in new formats. Healthcare declined about 25% as budget pressures continued to impact spending. Customers are spending where they have to in areas like security and software. Otherwise, projects are still on hold during this quarter.  Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, decreased 8% on a reported basis. U.K. net sales declined high single digits in constant currency. U.K. corporate and public channels declined as government support programs ramped down during the quarter. Canada net sales decreased low double digits in constant currency, an improvement compared to second quarter performance and some corporate projects came off hold and education remains strong driven by remote learning needs. As you can see, our third quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base. It also benefited from our deep and broad product portfolio. We were able to meet the varied and shifting demands of our customers. U.S. hardware was downloading the single digits, the client devices declining 2% due to desktop performance. [Indiscernible] is still strong driven by our public sector. Software increased low single digits and software gross profit increased strong double digits reflecting the impact of mixing into software as a service. Services grew high single digits driven by strong professional services. Transactions were down slightly on top of last year's mid-teensgrowth. Solutions declined low single digit, a significant improvement from last quarter's double digit decline as some customers restarted infrastructure and larger project engagement.  We again delivered strong growth in our Cloud practice. Cloud customers spend increased double digits across all customer end markets driven by robust growth in security, collaboration, infrastructure as a service, and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue with.  Security also continues to be a top priority for customers. Security customers spend grew strong double digits this quarter as customers improve their security frameworks to respond to the increasing threats.  Our third quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio customer end market, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. There are important drivers of our past and future performance. Let me review each.  As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels; corporate, small business, government, education and healthcare. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets including federal governments, state and local governments, K-12 and higher education, providing a deep industry knowledge and insights into our customers' objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our U.K. and Canadian operation. The diversity of our customer end market serve us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Next, our offerings are broad and deep. With over 100,000 products, services and solutions from more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well-positioned to meet our customers total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I shared, the balance of our customer end markets in our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment.  And the final driver of our performance our three-part strategy for growth which is first to acquire new customers and capture share, second, to enhance our solutions capabilities. And third, to expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deploy and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Today's environment strengthens our commitment to executing our strategy so we will emerge stronger than ever after this crisis.  Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers this quarter. Our K-12 team was extraordinarily busy this quarter. One reason was the award of a contract from the Mississippi Department of Education to support its Equity in Distance Learning program. This is one of the largest education technology initiatives in the United States in the last decade, funded via the CARES Act. It will help close the technology gap and support all public school districts in the state by providing students and teachers with secure devices and accessories backed by our services. The team leveraged our logistical excellence, our broad services capabilities and our strong vendor partner relationship to procure and deploy the devices in a supply-constrained environment, all done within a very compressed time frame given the urgency. This is a great example of how our teams align with their customers' missions and deliver creative solutions and differentiated value. Digital transformation in particular cloud adoption and integration is a top priority for many of our customers. Cloud creates complexity, especially if customers integrate their infrastructure balancing applications on-prem and in the cloud. Our team worked with a large retailer to develop its future state business strategy for its on-premise and cloud platform to operate as one. This is a great example of where our services and products and solutions portfolio combined for the best outcome for our customers. It also demonstrates the value IGNW brings to CDW and how we are leveraging its cloud native service expertise. Another customer in our corporate channel had a problem with this incumbent primary IT partner, which was exacerbated due to the pandemic. The IT director urgently turned to the CDW account manager to help with the company's employees to work from home when the other partner failed to deliver. The account manager responded quickly and exceeded expectations, which has since resulted in the customer moving all of its IT business to CDW. Our team has also helped the customer to develop a strong collaboration platform and is helping with a variety of initiatives including lowering IT costs, increasing flexibility of its on-premise backup storage, evaluating cloud options, shoring up its security, and augmenting its IT staff and CDW resources. Our work here represents another example of how customers turn to us for a high level of customer service, expertise across the full IT lifecycle and thought leadership.  These examples highlight CDW's three-part strategy for growth and how IT is crucial to achieving our customer's objectives. This quarter demonstrated the importance of our competitive advantages, the success of past investments in cloud and security and our trusted partner relationships with customers. I'm proud of the way our teams continues to execute and deliver. Let me now update you on our efforts to manage COVID-19's impact on our business. We remain focused on three key principles, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers, serve the mission driven needs of our customers, and support our communities. Our office coworkers are still working from home and the team is settled well into the new way of working. We expect most coworkers will be working from home until the start of next summer. Coworker engagement, productivity and collaboration are strong testament to the strength and resiliency of our culture. We are planning for when and how to return to the office and where and how our coworkers will work in the future. We will remain agile in this unpredictable environment. All distribution and configuration centers are operational and we maintain precautionary measures as advised by public health authorities. These teams have done an exceptional job maintaining a high level of customer service we are known for while taking the necessary precautions. Let's now turn to the fourth quarter. The macroeconomic outlook for the near term and for the foreseeable future remains uncertain. Wildcards include the duration and severity of COVID-19, tomorrow's U.S. elections, additional stimulus programs, supply disruptions and UK-EU trade negotiations. Therefore, we are not providing 2020 target. Q4 to-date writings trends for our corporate channel are in line with Q3. Writings trends have improved for our small business channel.  Public strength continues to be driven by education and governance offset by healthcare. We are encouraged about our performance and how our teams are executing. That said, we are also cautious about the macro environment. There are a lot of unknowns and factors that we do not control. This is just the time of unprecedented uncertainty.  Our customers continue to be in various phases of responding to the macro environment. Some customers remain focused on remote enablement and operational continuity. Others are moving forward with organizational efficiency and optimization. And other customers are investing behind digital transformation including cloud. It's important to remember that cloud is not an endpoint. Cloud is the element of our customers IT environment and it adds complexity which is a core to our value proposition. Our teams help our customers with a full IT solution stack and full IT lifecycle. We will continue to be trusted partners to help our customers smartly deploy their IT resources, adopt modern software and infrastructure patterns and practices, and solve some of their toughest challenges. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years to come. We have confidence that we have the right strategy in place. The increase to our dividend and restarting of our share buybacks that we announced today demonstrate the confidence that our board of directors and I have CDW's strategy and future performance. The investments we have made including investments to support our cloud and security practices will enable us to continue to meet our customers' needs. We will help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape and adopt new technologies. While there is uncertainty in the near term, we believe we are making the right moves for long-term success. We are committed to investing in our three-part growth strategy including the capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity, and enhance our competitive position. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best. Leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and now execute our competition. Now, Colin will share more details on our financial performance. Colin?\nCollin Kebo: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our third quarter results, liquidity position and capital allocation priorities. Turning to our third quarter P&L on slide 9, consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion down 3.1% on a reported and average daily sales basis. In constant currency, consolidated net sales declined by 3.3%. On an average daily sales basis, Sequential Sales increased 8.9% versus the second quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality primarily due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on second quarter results. Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand and writings commentary shared on our last earnings call. Pockets of supply dislocation continued in the quarter, and we leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure the IT products and solutions. Our customers needed for remote enablement, operations continuity and resource optimization. Gross profit for the quarter was $826 million, an increase of 1.1%. Gross margin was 17.4%, up 80 basis points over last year. The better than expected gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues primarily software as a service, which more than offset mixing into public. Turning to SG&A on Slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A increased 0.7%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs from the acquisitions of Aptris and IGNW and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline co-workers partially offset by continued savings, measures including decreased travel and entertainment and hiring restrictions. In September to ensure the alignment of our cost structure and resources to best position CDW for future growth, we've reduced our workforce by approximately 2%. Our realignment measures enable us to continue to evolve with customers' most important priorities ensuring capacity in high demand areas to support future growth and to continue investing in the business to emerge stronger from the crisis. We recorded a charge of $8.5 million which you can see in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on Slide 10. Co-worker count at the end of the quarter was 9,980 down 68 from the second quarter reflecting the realignment measures and restrictions on hiring and backfills, partially offset by IGNW. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 137, primarily driven by the Aptris and IGNW acquisitions. GAAP operating income was $380 million, down 0.9%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $386 million, up 1.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.1%. Moving to Slide 11. Interest expense was $40 million, down 5.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate on the term loan.\n2020: To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation, which is shown on Slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%, down 250 basis points versus last year's rate. The rate decrease is primarily related to a one time impact of state tax refunds and reduced global intangible low tax income and non-deductible expenses due to recent IRS regulations. As you can see on Slide 14, with third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.33, down 2.6%. Our non-GAAP net income was $265 million in the quarter, up 6.2% compared to last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.83, up 8% from last year. Turning to year-to-date results on Slides 15 through 20, revenue was $13.5 billion, an increase of 0.1% on a reported basis and down 0.4% on an average daily sales basis, as we got one extra selling day in the first quarter of 2020. The extra selling day will reverse in Q4 when we have one fewer selling day compared to prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, year-to-date consolidated net sales were down 0.3% from prior year. Gross profit was $2.3 billion, up 3% and gross profit margin was 17.2%, up 40 basis points. Operating income was $847 million and non-GAAP operating income was $1 billion, up 0.2%. Net income was $550 million and non-GAAP net income was $691 million, up 2.6%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $4.77, up 5.2%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 21. As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $1.25 billion and net debt was $2.7 billion. Liquidity continues to be strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.2 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow was $837 million, as shown on Slide 22. This is higher than normal seasonality and above last year's $590 million, primarily due to higher cash profit and lower investment in working capital this year. A portion of the better than normal seasonality is working capital timing that we expect to reverse over the next few quarters. Moving to Slide 23. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down one day from last year's third quarter. While cash collections were solid in the quarter, DSO increased five days driven by the strength of netted down items such as software-as-a-service, mixing into some larger public customers who can take longer to pay and certain commercial customers extending payments. DPO increased six days driven by the strengthen in netted down items and mixing into vendors with extended payment terms. In the quarter, we returned $54 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and did not repurchase any stock. Turning to capital allocation priorities on Slide 24, as Chris noted, we announced earlier today that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share to be paid on December 10 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 25. This represents 5.3% increase over the current dividend. We also announced that we will be resuming share repurchases this quarter. The dividend and share repurchase actions reflect our strong liquidity position, net leverage below the target range and the free cash flow generation capability of the business.  The decision to return capital to shareholders, that's consistent with our capital allocation priorities, which are, first, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. The annual dividend of $1.60 is approximately 25% of trailing 12 month non-GAAP net income through September. The Q4 2020 dividend marks the seventh consecutive year of increases with since our initial public offering in 2013 with the dividend growing at a compound annual growth rate of 38 percent from its initial level. We will continue targeting a 25% payoff ratio going forward growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 1.8 times below the low end of the range.  Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisition. We closed IGNW at the beginning of the third quarter and remained active in evaluating targets and will seek to be opportunistic in this environment. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating and cultural fit and financial return.  Fourth, as I previously mentioned, we are doing our share repurchase program. Going forward we expect to move closer to our target net leverage range to a combination of organic investments, M&A, and/or returning greater than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. As we always do, and particularly in this uncertain environment, we'll closely the macro-economic environment, our liquidity, working capital and leverage and adjust as needed.  Lastly, on the topic of capital, we intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We believe it's important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that will allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position.  We previously withdrew our 2020 targets and will not be providing an updated financial outlook. But consistent with the last three quarters, I wanted to provide insights into what we're seeing roughly one month into the fourth quarter from a demand, supply and operating perspective. On the demand side, activity continues to be mixed across customer end markets. In corporate, October writings declined in line with the level of Q3 writing declines. In small business, October writings improved from Q3 levels. And in public, October writings were up year-over-year driven by continued strength in education and government partially offset by declines in healthcare. While encouraging, as Chris mentioned, we believe it's premature to extrapolate October writings over the balance of the quarter given the wildcard, the COVID-19, the election, stimulus, and supply. We expect commercial customers to continue to be cautious. As I previously mentioned, we have one fewer selling day in the fourth quarter which adversely impacts quarterly profit growth by approximately 200 basis points.  On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a food environment with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. Notebook supplies particularly lower-end devices, such as Chromebooks are tight. Also, freight challenges may develop as we get closer to the holidays. On the operating front, all distribution centers continue to be operational. Finally, I want to provide an update on the device-as-a-service solution to the U.S. Census Bureau. The contribution to third quarter net sales was in line with expectations as we had deployed all of the devices into the field. The contribution to incremental growth was less than preceding quarters since the majority of last year's revenue was recognized in the third quarter. As Chris mentioned, data collection for the U.S. Census has ended and we're in the final phases of the project.  Devices are returning to us for decommissioning. From a financial perspective, this year, we now expect the census to contribute up to approximately 180 basis points of incremental net sales growth over 2019. On an absolute basis, we currently expect the census to contribute over 230 basis points of net sales in 2020. The collection and decommissioning timing remain fluid, so we could see some net sales shift into the first quarter of 2021.  That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Jaclyn to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tim Yang from Citi. Your line is open.\nTim Yang: Hi, thanks for taking the question. In the past three years your Q4 gross margin was higher than Q3. What do you think about Q4 this year? I think your mix should be better on quarter-on-quarter basis given the recovery. So, your gross margin should be better sequentially. Is that -- like what do you think about the gross margin for Q4 this year?\nCollin Kebo: Good morning, Tim. Thanks for joining the call. We're not going to provide guidance on the Q4 outlook. I guess, what I would just share on your observation is that historically Q3 has been a seasonally high sales quarter driven by strength in education and government which tend to have lower gross margin. So, I think what's happening historically is coming off of that seasonally high quarter where we mix into government and education you come off of that into Q4 and that's why you would've seen the gross margin pick up historically. I think that given what's happening in the marketplace right now particularly in education, all bets are off on normal seasonality. So I would just offer the response.\nTim Yang: Got you. And then regarding your Q4 corporate and SMB writing commentaries, I think you mentioned a decline seeing with your last quarter and the last quarter, I think that the decline was roughly leaping down -- you think year-to-year basis. You obviously -- merchant companies mentioned that projects are coming back. I was wondering, like, why you're not seeing that increments in U.S. SMB and corporate business. Is that more just conservatives -- conservatism or it's just like you're -- your visibility is not quite improving compared to last quarter? Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Hi Tim, it's Chris. Good morning. And, yeah, I don't think that we saw a nice increase in our solutions project based business. We have mentioned in the last call that customers had continued to pause on moving forward. They were in planning stages. We did see more customers both in our corporate space and small business space start to move forward on infrastructure projects, for example, in larger projects. I would say, you know, on the corporate side there's still caution and they're not quite as nimble as the small business organizations generally have a lot more kind of bureaucracy and approval to get through. So that seems to be going a little slower but certainly we're seeing some pick up in both of those segments. Operator  Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani for Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess, I have two as well. Just firstly, just clarify the writing discussion. I think what you guys characterize this as from the corporate side things are about stable or they are about what they were in the June -- in the September quarter so far. And in SMB started to improve the pace of decline has tried to ease up. I'm wanting to make sure I got that right. And then any sense on how transactional versus solutions is trending from a writings basis so far?\nChris Leahy: Amit, it's Chris. Yes, you read that right. You got that exactly right on the writings the way we described it. But we're not spreading out writings for solutions versus transaction.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. I guess, maybe I would ask you a different one then. If you could talk about what percent of your gross profit dollars today in the September quarter are agency based or weaker in nature and as you do longer term it would be really helpful to understand, what is the growth side look like for that gross profit dollar bucket versus the overall company? And then what are the components within this agency and recurring revenue stream that you have?\nCollin Kebo: Good morning, Amit. Yeah, netted down items were approximately 30% of total growth profit dollars in the quarter which is when the higher numbers we've seen and that mainly reflects the strong mix into cloud specifically software-as-a-service that both Chris and I talked about in our prepared comments. Included in that bucket is cloud security software and other software offerings that net down warranties, those would be the primary things that you would see in that bucket.  In terms of, you know, how that trends over time I think, you know, we would expect customers to continue moving into cloud and to -- you know, we expect strong demand for security software. So I think we would expect solid growth in that bucket. I think the wild card again in terms of where it goes and what happens to the hardware part of the business. Obviously, that's been a little bit more challenged in the COVID environment. In the preceding three years, it was very strong. So, I think exactly where that mix goes is probably more a function of how hardware gross profit trends over the next couple of quarters and years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start on the decision to resume share repurchases and how we should read into that. You still have over 2 billion in liquidity. You're low below your optimal leverage levels and, you know, previous discussions before COVID you were not precluding yourself from a larger sized acquisition, $1 billion plus type of an acquisition. So, I guess, the question would be, wondering if you could maybe share your latest stocks on M&A landscape and how that's evolved?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Sure, Adam. Well, you know the decision to restart our buybacks is a real reflection on both our confidence in our strategy and performance of U.S. going forward in addition, obviously to our strong free cash flow and liquidity position. On M&A in particular, I'll repeat what I've said over the last few quarters, we are actively looking to invest prudently to supplement high growth technology areas. You've seen us do a couple of acquisitions recently, in service now capabilities and cloud native capabilities, both of which has been taken up -- had been taken up very well by our sales organization, and really solidifying our advisor position with our customers. Those are the types of acquisitions we'll continue to look at and do look at. I would tell you, Adam, that there -- that the market itself feels a little [indiscernible]. Organizations are out, open to discussion now more than I'd say they were a couple months ago, but as you know our lenses. We look for those that fit our capabilities, our strategic capabilities, our culture, and operating model, and then ultimately makes financial sense.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. That's helpful to me. Maybe just as a follow up, I wanted to ask on some aspects, I think, if I have it right, you previously talked about letting attrition run its course. Looks like demand is, kind of, turning the corner a little bit, EBITDA margin was very healthy in the quarter. So I just wanted some more color on why reduce the workforce. I know, it's not a significant number in and of itself, but a little bit unusual for CDW to do that, so maybe more color did expectations for future growth change. What -- why would you ever take that? Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Adam, it's a great question. And you're right. Those are hard decisions for CDW in particular. It's just the second time in our history that we've produced the workforce, and reduced it by -- that by 2%. But really, this is all about ensuring alignment of our cost structure and resources to best position us for the future. So we really need to ensure we've got the resources to continue to evolve with customers in their most important priorities. We wanted to make sure that there's capacity in the high demand areas to support the future growth and continue investing in those more emerging areas. So while we have cutbacks some positions, we also are hiring in those areas that we think are critical to our future growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Cabral from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatt Cabral: Chris, you mentioned a lot of moving pieces out there from a macro standpoint in prepared remarks and clearly spent a year that's below trend from an IT spending point of view. I guess, just thinking about looking forward curious if you think customers are sitting now at this point with a meaningful amount of pent-up demand as we head into next year as to maybe help turn things around, or if there's a risk of this more sluggish demand environment continues as we start getting into the next year?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Good morning, Matt. I think is it possible to have both, I would say yes to both. Why do I say that? Because, I think, until this medical problem is resolved, it's going to have -- it'd be very difficult to have a closer trajectory of the economic environment and that has an impact obviously on uncertainty and actions that our customers are taking. So it's just murky, and that murkiness makes it very difficult to project. I certainly think that we have two things. We have pent up demand and we have customers who are frankly pressing advance, if you will, buying technology and implementing technology at a higher pace to press their advantage.  But as far as pent-up demand, I think, the real question becomes when our customer is feeling -- when are they feeling comfortable enough to make larger investments and I just think that's incredibly difficult to predict. What we're doing is staying closer to customers, if you've heard us talk about the complete spectrum of IT that we're providing and we're just making sure that they get what they need, when they need it better than anyone else in the industry can do it. But it's hard for me to predict the future, given the murky nature of this current outlook.\nMatt Cabral: And then looking by vertical education was clearly the standout in the quarter. Why don't talk a little bit more about just what you're seeing there and how sustainable you think those headwinds are just particularly relative to the ability to actually get enough supply to meet demand going forward?\nChris Leahy:\n -- :\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to ask a high level question first. As we see new restrictions and lockdown measures in Europe, can you just give us your thoughts on that? And also, how many -- what percent of your workforce is now working from home? And do you think CDW is in a better position to handle if there's a resurgence in COVID and lockdowns?\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Ruplu. Thank you. Good to hear from you. Yeah, I think that we have to be cautious in all the locations where we start to see more restrictions and lockdown. And for a couple of reasons and for a couple of segments, I think, in the U.K., as you know, we have some government stimulus money that is rolling off and that is tending to have an impact that we're seeing. Add to that lockdowns and the economic commercial impact that has, we do worry about that.  That said, we still have customers, as I said before, who are digitally advanced and really pressing their advantage and absolutely moving forward with some larger projects. Across the U.S., I would also say that cautiously if you look over the last week or so and the trajectory an uptick in cases is worrisome as different states potentially are moving backwards in their restrictions and lockdown. So look, as I said, I'm so encouraged by the team and the execution and the performance of this team. But I'm highly cautious about the excess exogenous factors that we can impact.  As far as work from home, look, the team settled in. This is a performance-oriented organization and they -- everybody went home, we got ourselves set up and we're off to the races. I think our co-worker services and sales leadership a huge kudos for figuring out very quickly creatively to drive productivity, connectivity, and human touch both across our sales organizations and with our customers. And they've been doing just great.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Great. Thanks for that. And appreciate all the color there. Chris, I wanted to ask you also on the device-as-a-service project, now that the census project is coming to an end. What's the plan for those devices and can you reuse them in some other program? And how do you see the device-as-a-service business going over the next couple of years? Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Good morning, Ruplu. I'm going to take that one. Yeah, so we are winding up the device-as-a-service offering to the census, those devices are coming back to CDW for decommissioning. And what we will do then is turn around and resell those to our remarketer and we have plans in place to go ahead and execute against that.  In terms of devices and services and offering, I think that will continue to be an opportunity for CDW. Clearly, we have competitive advantages in our ability to bundle integrated solutions across multiple vendors, integrating services, as well as our logistics capabilities. And I think what we're doing for the State of Mississippi Department of Education is just another flavor of our ability to deliver that value to customers. And in a world where being able to work productively, remotely from anywhere is becoming increasingly important, I think that's going to be an important part of our growth drivers going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much and good morning. I'm wondering about the customer demand for SaaS. And specifically -- or actually just netted down revenue in general, how much of this revenue is coming from sort of application versus utilization of the cloud for data storage and processing? I'm just trying to figure out where our customers are in their cloud progression, and then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, Shannon, I guess, let me start where customers are in their cloud progression and I would say that it's a full spectrum. We don\u2019t break all applications versus consumption usage in those numbers. But I would just tell you that we have customers that are across the full spectrum. Small customers fully on cloud, high consumption, medium and large customers who are dealing with heavily cloud-oriented applications but on-prem legacy obligations such as on working the cloud and we're working this in terms of modernizing their data center infrastructure to create one cloud environment, if you will, between their public on-prem private and on-prem legacy work. So it's really hard I think to say where customers stand because they're on quite a spectrum but what I can say is they are all moving to some form of cloud environment. And when I say cloud environment, I don\u2019t mean landing in the cloud because, you know, the cloud is not a place. It's more an operating system. It's a pattern, not a place and it delivers an experience, not a destination.  So what we see ourselves involved in is the planning and design accelerated by this accelerated digital environment to determine what that cloud environment works for a customer taking into consideration not just the benefits of a cloud-like environment that agility, susceptibility, scalability but also the cost issues and the legacy technology that they have to deal with. So I'm sorry that's a long-winded answer but we're selling the spectrum. We're helping customers with the spectrum and our comprehensive suite of capabilities allows us to do that wherever a customer is on their cloud journey.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe on a segment basis, can you talk about where customers are versus, like, new projects versus continuing to work remote enablement and continuity. I know you mentioned with education, you think it's going to kind of wind up by the end of this year and then or at least hopefully get -- you know, be done pretty much by then. But SMB and maybe enterprise, are you seeing customers still really focused on just making sure their employees have end devices and connectivity or do you feel like that\u2019s kind of done and now people are moving back to, I don't know, prior investments or new opportunities? Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, Shannon, it's a mix across segments. If you look at corporate, for example, we had seen the work-from-home moderated a bit and what I mean by that is the -- you know, the notebook devices and the rush to get everybody working from home. I suspect in that segment, for example, we're going to have to see what work in the future looks like and when and how customers start going back to the office and then they make their decisions, you would expect to take off then in terms of things that help optimize either to work from home or the work in the office now or the hybrid place that they land. But it has moderated a bit in the corporate space.  Small business, we continue to see strength in work from home. Now, that could be in some part because small business were a little later to get there than maybe the larger businesses. And so it's really, it's really different across segments.  Healthcare really rushed to the front end, they were obviously a high priority from an allocation perspective for us and others. And so that's moderated in the healthcare space as well. So we're really seeing education, K through 12, higher ed, as the primary drivers of continuing work from home, as well as federal. I would say that the government space as well as been continuing to be fairly robust in work from home support. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley, your line is open. \nKaty Huberty: Colin, as we think about the census project wrapping up over the next quarter and one less selling day, is it possible that the revenue declines doesn't improve in the fourth quarter or do the improved SMB writings create a tailwind that we continue to see a lesser decline trajectory like what you use on the third quarter \nCollin Kebo: Yeah, Katy, we're not going to give a specific guide on fourth quarter sales. So what I would say is we do have one fewer day, we report sales on an average daily sales basis. So that would normalize for that. The 200 basis points is really a comment about the impact it has on the bottom half of the P&L, as we get a little bit of deleverage year-over-year.  As it relates to the census, I would expect the census to provide solid contribution to the fourth quarter; it is going to provide a benefit. Again, as we look at last year's overlap, most of it was in the third quarter. So it will contribute incrementally year-over-year. And then, I think, as it relates to the comments on writing, we are back to the wild cards and I think particularly on the commercial side of the business, how those customers choose to react to the election, and what impact the virus and potential additional shutdowns has on their spending plans as we come into the end of the year.\nKaty Huberty: Okay. Thank you. And then just on third quarter margins, you mentioned that product margins were better in the quarter, in addition to the mix shift in netted down revenue. Can you just talk about what drove the better product margins? Is that a mix shift away from client and starting to see some growth again in some of the infrastructure areas like servers and computers?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. Katy, I would say it was a combination of things. There was some mix within products, so, for example, desktops were pretty soft as notebook has become the form factor of choice, desktops tend to have low margin. So that helped the product margin a little bit. But I would say that this pandemic and economic shock is a little bit unique compared to other recessions or slowdowns that we've been through. I think one thing that's different is you have supply-demand imbalance occurring at the same time. And so that supply imbalance, I think, has provided a bit of cushion on the margin.  And then I think that the second thing that's unique is just how important technology is to being a part of the solution here and customers focus on getting things done with partners they trust, and that can manifest itself in speed, level of service, logistics capabilities, but I think what we're seeing is customers just want it done, they want it done quickly, and they want it done right. And maybe we're not going to go through another round of bids through the procurement department or whatever it is, and that that has played into, I think, some of the product margin durability that we saw in what you might think would be a period of compassion on the on the product margin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatthew Sheerin: Chris, in your commentary, you mentioned some customer engagements including some new customer wins due to your capabilities. Can you just talk about that competitive environment? Are you seeing the acceleration of new customer wins due to that, and due to the fact that customers need more help?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Good morning, Matt. You know, I won't repeat everything that Collin just said, but when I think about what customers feel today, technology is more critical, technology is more complex, and they need a comprehensive solutions to the issues they're trying to solve. And so with a valued trusted partner like CDW, they're more inclined to start leaning into CDW versus, for example, local vendors. So what we're seeing out there as well as a competitive environment, certainly from a pricing perspective, the value that CDW brings to their -- to customers would become more important. I mentioned their de-risking their investments. They want to ensure that they are getting the full suite -- comprehensive suite of advice, because of the complexity of choice that they're facing, and the stakes are high that they get technology right and get it to work for them.  So the value that CDW brings is resonating very well in this environment. We are seeing new customers and winning new customers and growing those customers frankly, pretty quickly. And we're also seeing vendor move -- a quicker move to vendor consolidation, that's always been a value is brought to customers but it's -- that's ticked up significantly in the environment that we're in across all of our segments, frankly.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I just wanted to ask again on the client devices, particularly on the commercial side where you talked about it being down. You did have some commentary about trends you're seeing. But I just wanted to see if you're seeing basically that upgrade cycle we saw last year and obviously crept into this year due to work from home. Are you just seeing signs that that's sort of ending and you're going to be faced -- facing some tough year-over-your comps in next couple of quarters on the client device side?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Matt, what I'd say is, look, we get -- when we were coming into this year, we thought we were in the late innings of client device, refreshing growth is moderating. Now what picked it up early this year, work from home, obviously, learned from home, we're seeing new cases in the digital world, think of retail organizations, et cetera. And certainly, we might start to see some more pickup and refresh from the 2017 period. But yes, you're right, the overlaps that we're facing from the growth of last year and that pull forward at the beginning of this year and the education et cetera, as I said. And then you layer on that just the economic environment employment, it's hard to say what to expect going into next year.  That said, work from home does have a lot of requirements to make it work effectively. So we continue to help customers even in the mid large space with their security needs, for example, with their collaboration needs, with their productivity suites that they're working through. So even if we don't see notebooks as robust right now, it's the whole solution, work from solution, including the accessories and the services and the collaboration, et cetera.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. Hey, I want to explore the supply constraints challenges in the quarter. I think it's well-known one of the challenges getting the Chromebooks in the door. But pressing for rather the commentary, did you see that's easing at all during the end of the quarter? And then are there other areas of this analogy is that you see having also some supply constraints that can help out in the fourth quarter?\nCollin Kebo: Good morning, Keith. Yeah, I think the constraints within Chromebooks are well-documented. I don't know that I would say it eased as we exited the quarter, I think it's going to be tight for a while here. Now, obviously, our scale and the fact that we work with multiple OEMs will hopefully help us manage through that and get at least our fair share, as Chris has talked about earlier.  In terms of notebooks in general, I would say again, high demand. And we're just seeing longer lead times than normal. We are hearing about component shortages for things that go into Chromebooks and Notebooks, things like panels.  In terms of other parts of the market, I would say on the solution side of the business the supply environment is maybe a little bit better than it was a quarter or two ago. In other areas where we see pockets of dislocation or delays with the other remote, more mission critical categories, like collaboration, hardware, headsets and webcams.\nKeith Housum: Got you. Is it possible to quantify what the supply shortage is perhaps costing business in third quarter?\nCollin Kebo: Boy, it would be really difficult to put a number on that. I mean, I could say our backlog is up meaningfully in the Notebook category over where it's running -- where it's run historically.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Paul Coster from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nPaul Coster: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering, Chris, if you could just elaborate a little bit on the uncertainty you're seeing. I think we all understand the weather and when part of it, but I'm wondering that how is this part of the uncertainty as well, given that COVID seems to have been an accelerant, as you've described, of change in digitalization, in particular, how many of your customers just feel unsure of what to invest in, given the change to their processes and sort of infrastructure paradigm?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. That's a great question. I think here's how I would answer it. Their -- projects that many customers had into, they're rethinking what those little like now, infrastructure projects, for example, in particular. The good news is we've got that capability to sit down and work through that design with them. And in last quarter's earnings call, I mentioned that that had ticked up. We thought we were starting to sit down and help customers design for a new world. Every customer understands the criticality of technology and the need to get it right and how different it is today than it was literally just 12 months ago, the acceleration of digital, not a new trend, but an acceleration. So we see that as an opportunity to help our customers get the other side of this stronger than ever. \nleaner:\nPaul Coster: Got you, and one quick follow up for Collin. The -- can you, sort of, quantify the revenue headwind associated with the netting down effects of the cloud revenue with the cloud contracts?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. I mean, Paul, what I would say is we have historically seen netted down items growing faster than full revenue items. So in normal periods of time, I would say that impact has 200 basis points impact, so a little bit more than that, given the acceleration of it.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Christine Leahy, CEO. Please go ahead.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Jaclyn. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the continued challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to recognize the remarkable dedication of all of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all of our CDW stakeholders. They continuously impress me and reaffirmed my conviction that we will emerge stronger from this. Thank you. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of third quarter results and drivers of performance. I'll provide our perspectives on the current macro environment, its impact on our customer end market and how we are responding. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We'll move quickly through the prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.  For the third quarter net sales were $4.8 billion, 3.1% below last year and down 3.3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $386 million, an increase of 1.5%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.83, 8% above last year on a reported basis and up 7.7% in constant currency. The quarter demonstrated the balance and strength of CDW's business model. The diversity of our customer end markets served as well. For our most impacted customer end market the rate of decline stabilized and generally improved in the quarter. Trends for a more resilient customer end markets continue to be strong.  Our value proposition really resonated with customers this quarter. There was a flight to quality as customers start to de-risk projects in their technology investments. Our teams are trusted strategic partners to our customers. We compete on value and advice, not on the price. We helped customers this quarter across a spectrum of IP priorities. Customers were focused on remote enablement, optimization, cost reduction, security, and leveraging technology for better customer and employee engagement through digital transformation, with an increasing focus on cloud. Customer demand for software-as-a-service increased almost 50% quarter-over-quarter. Customers leveraged our cloud solutions capabilities further bolstered by our acquisition of IGNW at the beginning of the quarter. Our solutions business strengthened this quarter as some customers resumed projects that had been put on hold earlier in the year and others started new projects.  During the third quarter, we continue to leverage our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. We successfully secured supply in high demand categories and managed to longer lead times for others. Now let's take a deeper look at the customer end market performance. Corporate declined 13%, markedly better than May and June. Solutions strengthened increasing low single digits year-over-year. The significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in solutions reflected customers restarting infrastructure and project engagement. Transactional projects were down double digit as spending on remote enablement moderated. Small Business also declined 13%, a considerable improvement versus the second quarter. Most product categories declined less this quarter as small business customers remained focused on remote enablement, security, cost management, and optimization.  The government team increased net sales high single digit. Federal delivered another strong quarter with net sales up mid-single digits. During the quarter our device-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau contributed less incremental growth than other quarters since the majority of last year's revenue was recognized in the third quarter. We are in the final phase of the project. Data collection has ended and devices are returning to us for decommissioning. Our team has done an excellent job navigating the complexity of this program from the very start.  Outside of the census project, the federal team continued to help civilian agencies to promote enablement and device refresh. Some Department of Defense solution projects got pushed to future quarters dampening performance. The state and local team deliver high single-digit growth. IT investments continue to be a priority for public safety. In some cases budget was reallocated to support technology initiatives.  Our team helps customers enable remote capabilities, enhanced security and optimize technology assets. Education increased over 30% with excellent growth in both K-12 and Higher Ed. In K-12, customers continue to focus on equity and access for students. K-12 growth is driven by strong notebook results and related accessories, security and software as well as cloud solutions to support remote learning. Higher ed performance strengthen this quarter as schools turned to us to leverage our extensive logistics capability to optimize technology to teach in new formats. Healthcare declined about 25% as budget pressures continued to impact spending. Customers are spending where they have to in areas like security and software. Otherwise, projects are still on hold during this quarter.  Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, decreased 8% on a reported basis. U.K. net sales declined high single digits in constant currency. U.K. corporate and public channels declined as government support programs ramped down during the quarter. Canada net sales decreased low double digits in constant currency, an improvement compared to second quarter performance and some corporate projects came off hold and education remains strong driven by remote learning needs. As you can see, our third quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base. It also benefited from our deep and broad product portfolio. We were able to meet the varied and shifting demands of our customers. U.S. hardware was downloading the single digits, the client devices declining 2% due to desktop performance. [Indiscernible] is still strong driven by our public sector. Software increased low single digits and software gross profit increased strong double digits reflecting the impact of mixing into software as a service. Services grew high single digits driven by strong professional services. Transactions were down slightly on top of last year's mid-teensgrowth. Solutions declined low single digit, a significant improvement from last quarter's double digit decline as some customers restarted infrastructure and larger project engagement.  We again delivered strong growth in our Cloud practice. Cloud customers spend increased double digits across all customer end markets driven by robust growth in security, collaboration, infrastructure as a service, and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue with.  Security also continues to be a top priority for customers. Security customers spend grew strong double digits this quarter as customers improve their security frameworks to respond to the increasing threats.  Our third quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio customer end market, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. There are important drivers of our past and future performance. Let me review each.  As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels; corporate, small business, government, education and healthcare. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets including federal governments, state and local governments, K-12 and higher education, providing a deep industry knowledge and insights into our customers' objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our U.K. and Canadian operation. The diversity of our customer end market serve us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Next, our offerings are broad and deep. With over 100,000 products, services and solutions from more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well-positioned to meet our customers total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. As I shared, the balance of our customer end markets in our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment.  And the final driver of our performance our three-part strategy for growth which is first to acquire new customers and capture share, second, to enhance our solutions capabilities. And third, to expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deploy and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Today's environment strengthens our commitment to executing our strategy so we will emerge stronger than ever after this crisis.  Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers this quarter. Our K-12 team was extraordinarily busy this quarter. One reason was the award of a contract from the Mississippi Department of Education to support its Equity in Distance Learning program. This is one of the largest education technology initiatives in the United States in the last decade, funded via the CARES Act. It will help close the technology gap and support all public school districts in the state by providing students and teachers with secure devices and accessories backed by our services. The team leveraged our logistical excellence, our broad services capabilities and our strong vendor partner relationship to procure and deploy the devices in a supply-constrained environment, all done within a very compressed time frame given the urgency. This is a great example of how our teams align with their customers' missions and deliver creative solutions and differentiated value. Digital transformation in particular cloud adoption and integration is a top priority for many of our customers. Cloud creates complexity, especially if customers integrate their infrastructure balancing applications on-prem and in the cloud. Our team worked with a large retailer to develop its future state business strategy for its on-premise and cloud platform to operate as one. This is a great example of where our services and products and solutions portfolio combined for the best outcome for our customers. It also demonstrates the value IGNW brings to CDW and how we are leveraging its cloud native service expertise. Another customer in our corporate channel had a problem with this incumbent primary IT partner, which was exacerbated due to the pandemic. The IT director urgently turned to the CDW account manager to help with the company's employees to work from home when the other partner failed to deliver. The account manager responded quickly and exceeded expectations, which has since resulted in the customer moving all of its IT business to CDW. Our team has also helped the customer to develop a strong collaboration platform and is helping with a variety of initiatives including lowering IT costs, increasing flexibility of its on-premise backup storage, evaluating cloud options, shoring up its security, and augmenting its IT staff and CDW resources. Our work here represents another example of how customers turn to us for a high level of customer service, expertise across the full IT lifecycle and thought leadership.  These examples highlight CDW's three-part strategy for growth and how IT is crucial to achieving our customer's objectives. This quarter demonstrated the importance of our competitive advantages, the success of past investments in cloud and security and our trusted partner relationships with customers. I'm proud of the way our teams continues to execute and deliver. Let me now update you on our efforts to manage COVID-19's impact on our business. We remain focused on three key principles, safeguard the health and well-being of our coworkers, serve the mission driven needs of our customers, and support our communities. Our office coworkers are still working from home and the team is settled well into the new way of working. We expect most coworkers will be working from home until the start of next summer. Coworker engagement, productivity and collaboration are strong testament to the strength and resiliency of our culture. We are planning for when and how to return to the office and where and how our coworkers will work in the future. We will remain agile in this unpredictable environment. All distribution and configuration centers are operational and we maintain precautionary measures as advised by public health authorities. These teams have done an exceptional job maintaining a high level of customer service we are known for while taking the necessary precautions. Let's now turn to the fourth quarter. The macroeconomic outlook for the near term and for the foreseeable future remains uncertain. Wildcards include the duration and severity of COVID-19, tomorrow's U.S. elections, additional stimulus programs, supply disruptions and UK-EU trade negotiations. Therefore, we are not providing 2020 target. Q4 to-date writings trends for our corporate channel are in line with Q3. Writings trends have improved for our small business channel.  Public strength continues to be driven by education and governance offset by healthcare. We are encouraged about our performance and how our teams are executing. That said, we are also cautious about the macro environment. There are a lot of unknowns and factors that we do not control. This is just the time of unprecedented uncertainty.  Our customers continue to be in various phases of responding to the macro environment. Some customers remain focused on remote enablement and operational continuity. Others are moving forward with organizational efficiency and optimization. And other customers are investing behind digital transformation including cloud. It's important to remember that cloud is not an endpoint. Cloud is the element of our customers IT environment and it adds complexity which is a core to our value proposition. Our teams help our customers with a full IT solution stack and full IT lifecycle. We will continue to be trusted partners to help our customers smartly deploy their IT resources, adopt modern software and infrastructure patterns and practices, and solve some of their toughest challenges. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years to come. We have confidence that we have the right strategy in place. The increase to our dividend and restarting of our share buybacks that we announced today demonstrate the confidence that our board of directors and I have CDW's strategy and future performance. The investments we have made including investments to support our cloud and security practices will enable us to continue to meet our customers' needs. We will help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape and adopt new technologies. While there is uncertainty in the near term, we believe we are making the right moves for long-term success. We are committed to investing in our three-part growth strategy including the capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity, and enhance our competitive position. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best. Leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and now execute our competition. Now, Colin will share more details on our financial performance. Colin? Hi Tim, it's Chris. Good morning. And, yeah, I don't think that we saw a nice increase in our solutions project based business. We have mentioned in the last call that customers had continued to pause on moving forward. They were in planning stages. We did see more customers both in our corporate space and small business space start to move forward on infrastructure projects, for example, in larger projects. I would say, you know, on the corporate side there's still caution and they're not quite as nimble as the small business organizations generally have a lot more kind of bureaucracy and approval to get through. So that seems to be going a little slower but certainly we're seeing some pick up in both of those segments. Operator  Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani for Evercore. Your line is open. Amit, it's Chris. Yes, you read that right. You got that exactly right on the writings the way we described it. But we're not spreading out writings for solutions versus transaction. Yeah. Sure, Adam. Well, you know the decision to restart our buybacks is a real reflection on both our confidence in our strategy and performance of U.S. going forward in addition, obviously to our strong free cash flow and liquidity position. On M&A in particular, I'll repeat what I've said over the last few quarters, we are actively looking to invest prudently to supplement high growth technology areas. You've seen us do a couple of acquisitions recently, in service now capabilities and cloud native capabilities, both of which has been taken up -- had been taken up very well by our sales organization, and really solidifying our advisor position with our customers. Those are the types of acquisitions we'll continue to look at and do look at. I would tell you, Adam, that there -- that the market itself feels a little [indiscernible]. Organizations are out, open to discussion now more than I'd say they were a couple months ago, but as you know our lenses. We look for those that fit our capabilities, our strategic capabilities, our culture, and operating model, and then ultimately makes financial sense. Yeah. Adam, it's a great question. And you're right. Those are hard decisions for CDW in particular. It's just the second time in our history that we've produced the workforce, and reduced it by -- that by 2%. But really, this is all about ensuring alignment of our cost structure and resources to best position us for the future. So we really need to ensure we've got the resources to continue to evolve with customers in their most important priorities. We wanted to make sure that there's capacity in the high demand areas to support the future growth and continue investing in those more emerging areas. So while we have cutbacks some positions, we also are hiring in those areas that we think are critical to our future growth. Yeah. Good morning, Matt. I think is it possible to have both, I would say yes to both. Why do I say that? Because, I think, until this medical problem is resolved, it's going to have -- it'd be very difficult to have a closer trajectory of the economic environment and that has an impact obviously on uncertainty and actions that our customers are taking. So it's just murky, and that murkiness makes it very difficult to project. I certainly think that we have two things. We have pent up demand and we have customers who are frankly pressing advance, if you will, buying technology and implementing technology at a higher pace to press their advantage.  But as far as pent-up demand, I think, the real question becomes when our customer is feeling -- when are they feeling comfortable enough to make larger investments and I just think that's incredibly difficult to predict. What we're doing is staying closer to customers, if you've heard us talk about the complete spectrum of IT that we're providing and we're just making sure that they get what they need, when they need it better than anyone else in the industry can do it. But it's hard for me to predict the future, given the murky nature of this current outlook. --:Operator: Your next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is open. Good morning, Ruplu. Thank you. Good to hear from you. Yeah, I think that we have to be cautious in all the locations where we start to see more restrictions and lockdown. And for a couple of reasons and for a couple of segments, I think, in the U.K., as you know, we have some government stimulus money that is rolling off and that is tending to have an impact that we're seeing. Add to that lockdowns and the economic commercial impact that has, we do worry about that.  That said, we still have customers, as I said before, who are digitally advanced and really pressing their advantage and absolutely moving forward with some larger projects. Across the U.S., I would also say that cautiously if you look over the last week or so and the trajectory an uptick in cases is worrisome as different states potentially are moving backwards in their restrictions and lockdown. So look, as I said, I'm so encouraged by the team and the execution and the performance of this team. But I'm highly cautious about the excess exogenous factors that we can impact.  As far as work from home, look, the team settled in. This is a performance-oriented organization and they -- everybody went home, we got ourselves set up and we're off to the races. I think our co-worker services and sales leadership a huge kudos for figuring out very quickly creatively to drive productivity, connectivity, and human touch both across our sales organizations and with our customers. And they've been doing just great. Yeah, Shannon, I guess, let me start where customers are in their cloud progression and I would say that it's a full spectrum. We don't break all applications versus consumption usage in those numbers. But I would just tell you that we have customers that are across the full spectrum. Small customers fully on cloud, high consumption, medium and large customers who are dealing with heavily cloud-oriented applications but on-prem legacy obligations such as on working the cloud and we're working this in terms of modernizing their data center infrastructure to create one cloud environment, if you will, between their public on-prem private and on-prem legacy work. So it's really hard I think to say where customers stand because they're on quite a spectrum but what I can say is they are all moving to some form of cloud environment. And when I say cloud environment, I don't mean landing in the cloud because, you know, the cloud is not a place. It's more an operating system. It's a pattern, not a place and it delivers an experience, not a destination.  So what we see ourselves involved in is the planning and design accelerated by this accelerated digital environment to determine what that cloud environment works for a customer taking into consideration not just the benefits of a cloud-like environment that agility, susceptibility, scalability but also the cost issues and the legacy technology that they have to deal with. So I'm sorry that's a long-winded answer but we're selling the spectrum. We're helping customers with the spectrum and our comprehensive suite of capabilities allows us to do that wherever a customer is on their cloud journey. Yeah, Shannon, it's a mix across segments. If you look at corporate, for example, we had seen the work-from-home moderated a bit and what I mean by that is the -- you know, the notebook devices and the rush to get everybody working from home. I suspect in that segment, for example, we're going to have to see what work in the future looks like and when and how customers start going back to the office and then they make their decisions, you would expect to take off then in terms of things that help optimize either to work from home or the work in the office now or the hybrid place that they land. But it has moderated a bit in the corporate space.  Small business, we continue to see strength in work from home. Now, that could be in some part because small business were a little later to get there than maybe the larger businesses. And so it's really, it's really different across segments.  Healthcare really rushed to the front end, they were obviously a high priority from an allocation perspective for us and others. And so that's moderated in the healthcare space as well. So we're really seeing education, K through 12, higher ed, as the primary drivers of continuing work from home, as well as federal. I would say that the government space as well as been continuing to be fairly robust in work from home support. Yes. Good morning, Matt. You know, I won't repeat everything that Collin just said, but when I think about what customers feel today, technology is more critical, technology is more complex, and they need a comprehensive solutions to the issues they're trying to solve. And so with a valued trusted partner like CDW, they're more inclined to start leaning into CDW versus, for example, local vendors. So what we're seeing out there as well as a competitive environment, certainly from a pricing perspective, the value that CDW brings to their -- to customers would become more important. I mentioned their de-risking their investments. They want to ensure that they are getting the full suite -- comprehensive suite of advice, because of the complexity of choice that they're facing, and the stakes are high that they get technology right and get it to work for them.  So the value that CDW brings is resonating very well in this environment. We are seeing new customers and winning new customers and growing those customers frankly, pretty quickly. And we're also seeing vendor move -- a quicker move to vendor consolidation, that's always been a value is brought to customers but it's -- that's ticked up significantly in the environment that we're in across all of our segments, frankly. Yeah. Matt, what I'd say is, look, we get -- when we were coming into this year, we thought we were in the late innings of client device, refreshing growth is moderating. Now what picked it up early this year, work from home, obviously, learned from home, we're seeing new cases in the digital world, think of retail organizations, et cetera. And certainly, we might start to see some more pickup and refresh from the 2017 period. But yes, you're right, the overlaps that we're facing from the growth of last year and that pull forward at the beginning of this year and the education et cetera, as I said. And then you layer on that just the economic environment employment, it's hard to say what to expect going into next year.  That said, work from home does have a lot of requirements to make it work effectively. So we continue to help customers even in the mid large space with their security needs, for example, with their collaboration needs, with their productivity suites that they're working through. So even if we don't see notebooks as robust right now, it's the whole solution, work from solution, including the accessories and the services and the collaboration, et cetera. Yeah. That's a great question. I think here's how I would answer it. Their -- projects that many customers had into, they're rethinking what those little like now, infrastructure projects, for example, in particular. The good news is we've got that capability to sit down and work through that design with them. And in last quarter's earnings call, I mentioned that that had ticked up. We thought we were starting to sit down and help customers design for a new world. Every customer understands the criticality of technology and the need to get it right and how different it is today than it was literally just 12 months ago, the acceleration of digital, not a new trend, but an acceleration. So we see that as an opportunity to help our customers get the other side of this stronger than ever. Thank you, Jaclyn. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the continued challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to recognize the remarkable dedication of all of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all of our CDW stakeholders. They continuously impress me and reaffirmed my conviction that we will emerge stronger from this. Thank you. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Take care."

            "name": "Collin Kebo",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our third quarter results, liquidity position and capital allocation priorities. Turning to our third quarter P&L on slide 9, consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion down 3.1% on a reported and average daily sales basis. In constant currency, consolidated net sales declined by 3.3%. On an average daily sales basis, Sequential Sales increased 8.9% versus the second quarter. This was higher than historical seasonality primarily due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on second quarter results. Our customer channels generally performed consistent with the demand and writings commentary shared on our last earnings call. Pockets of supply dislocation continued in the quarter, and we leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure the IT products and solutions. Our customers needed for remote enablement, operations continuity and resource optimization. Gross profit for the quarter was $826 million, an increase of 1.1%. Gross margin was 17.4%, up 80 basis points over last year. The better than expected gross margin expansion was driven by product margin and mixing into netted down revenues primarily software as a service, which more than offset mixing into public. Turning to SG&A on Slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A increased 0.7%. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll costs from the acquisitions of Aptris and IGNW and COVID-19 expenses to safeguard and compensate frontline co-workers partially offset by continued savings, measures including decreased travel and entertainment and hiring restrictions. In September to ensure the alignment of our cost structure and resources to best position CDW for future growth, we've reduced our workforce by approximately 2%. Our realignment measures enable us to continue to evolve with customers' most important priorities ensuring capacity in high demand areas to support future growth and to continue investing in the business to emerge stronger from the crisis. We recorded a charge of $8.5 million which you can see in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on Slide 10. Co-worker count at the end of the quarter was 9,980 down 68 from the second quarter reflecting the realignment measures and restrictions on hiring and backfills, partially offset by IGNW. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 137, primarily driven by the Aptris and IGNW acquisitions. GAAP operating income was $380 million, down 0.9%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $386 million, up 1.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.1%. Moving to Slide 11. Interest expense was $40 million, down 5.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate on the term loan. Good morning, Tim. Thanks for joining the call. We're not going to provide guidance on the Q4 outlook. I guess, what I would just share on your observation is that historically Q3 has been a seasonally high sales quarter driven by strength in education and government which tend to have lower gross margin. So, I think what's happening historically is coming off of that seasonally high quarter where we mix into government and education you come off of that into Q4 and that's why you would've seen the gross margin pick up historically. I think that given what's happening in the marketplace right now particularly in education, all bets are off on normal seasonality. So I would just offer the response. Good morning, Amit. Yeah, netted down items were approximately 30% of total growth profit dollars in the quarter which is when the higher numbers we've seen and that mainly reflects the strong mix into cloud specifically software-as-a-service that both Chris and I talked about in our prepared comments. Included in that bucket is cloud security software and other software offerings that net down warranties, those would be the primary things that you would see in that bucket.  In terms of, you know, how that trends over time I think, you know, we would expect customers to continue moving into cloud and to -- you know, we expect strong demand for security software. So I think we would expect solid growth in that bucket. I think the wild card again in terms of where it goes and what happens to the hardware part of the business. Obviously, that's been a little bit more challenged in the COVID environment. In the preceding three years, it was very strong. So, I think exactly where that mix goes is probably more a function of how hardware gross profit trends over the next couple of quarters and years. Good morning, Ruplu. I'm going to take that one. Yeah, so we are winding up the device-as-a-service offering to the census, those devices are coming back to CDW for decommissioning. And what we will do then is turn around and resell those to our remarketer and we have plans in place to go ahead and execute against that.  In terms of devices and services and offering, I think that will continue to be an opportunity for CDW. Clearly, we have competitive advantages in our ability to bundle integrated solutions across multiple vendors, integrating services, as well as our logistics capabilities. And I think what we're doing for the State of Mississippi Department of Education is just another flavor of our ability to deliver that value to customers. And in a world where being able to work productively, remotely from anywhere is becoming increasingly important, I think that's going to be an important part of our growth drivers going forward. Yeah, Katy, we're not going to give a specific guide on fourth quarter sales. So what I would say is we do have one fewer day, we report sales on an average daily sales basis. So that would normalize for that. The 200 basis points is really a comment about the impact it has on the bottom half of the P&L, as we get a little bit of deleverage year-over-year.  As it relates to the census, I would expect the census to provide solid contribution to the fourth quarter; it is going to provide a benefit. Again, as we look at last year's overlap, most of it was in the third quarter. So it will contribute incrementally year-over-year. And then, I think, as it relates to the comments on writing, we are back to the wild cards and I think particularly on the commercial side of the business, how those customers choose to react to the election, and what impact the virus and potential additional shutdowns has on their spending plans as we come into the end of the year. Yeah. Katy, I would say it was a combination of things. There was some mix within products, so, for example, desktops were pretty soft as notebook has become the form factor of choice, desktops tend to have low margin. So that helped the product margin a little bit. But I would say that this pandemic and economic shock is a little bit unique compared to other recessions or slowdowns that we've been through. I think one thing that's different is you have supply-demand imbalance occurring at the same time. And so that supply imbalance, I think, has provided a bit of cushion on the margin.  And then I think that the second thing that's unique is just how important technology is to being a part of the solution here and customers focus on getting things done with partners they trust, and that can manifest itself in speed, level of service, logistics capabilities, but I think what we're seeing is customers just want it done, they want it done quickly, and they want it done right. And maybe we're not going to go through another round of bids through the procurement department or whatever it is, and that that has played into, I think, some of the product margin durability that we saw in what you might think would be a period of compassion on the on the product margin. Good morning, Keith. Yeah, I think the constraints within Chromebooks are well-documented. I don't know that I would say it eased as we exited the quarter, I think it's going to be tight for a while here. Now, obviously, our scale and the fact that we work with multiple OEMs will hopefully help us manage through that and get at least our fair share, as Chris has talked about earlier.  In terms of notebooks in general, I would say again, high demand. And we're just seeing longer lead times than normal. We are hearing about component shortages for things that go into Chromebooks and Notebooks, things like panels.  In terms of other parts of the market, I would say on the solution side of the business the supply environment is maybe a little bit better than it was a quarter or two ago. In other areas where we see pockets of dislocation or delays with the other remote, more mission critical categories, like collaboration, hardware, headsets and webcams. Boy, it would be really difficult to put a number on that. I mean, I could say our backlog is up meaningfully in the Notebook category over where it's running -- where it's run historically. Yeah. I mean, Paul, what I would say is we have historically seen netted down items growing faster than full revenue items. So in normal periods of time, I would say that impact has 200 basis points impact, so a little bit more than that, given the acceleration of it."

Please note that all references to growth rates or dollar amount increases in our remarks today are versus the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. In addition, all references to growth rates for hardware, software and services today represent U.S. net sales only, and do not include the results from CDW UK or Canada. A replay this webcast will be posted to our website later today. I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW, and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of second quarter results and drivers of performance. I'll provide our perspectives on the current macro environment, its impact on our customers and market and how we are responding. Collin, will then take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. For the second quarter net sales were $4.4 billion, 5.7% below last year and down 5.3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $338 million, a decrease of 5.6%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.56, 2.6% below last year on a reported basis and down 2.3% in constant currency. For the quarter net sales performance varied by month and by customer end market. As we shared on our last earnings call, we entered April with a healthy backlog of remote workforce enablement solution, which contributed to strong performance in April. As the quarter progressed, for some of our customer end markets projects were postponed and demand declined, as the economic toll of the crisis impacted customer spend. In other customer end markets, IT investment was prioritized and remained healthy. During the quarter, we helped customers across a spectrum of IT priorities, remote enablement, business and operations continuity and security remain top customer focus areas to manage remote environments at scale, and to prepare to work and learn from home in some capacity for longer. Customers also focus on initiatives to reduce cost, optimize resources, and leverage technology for better customer and employee experiences through digital transformation. CDW teams orchestrated turnkey solutions from our broad portfolio of clients' devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security, software and cloud offering to help customers build these capabilities and achieve their goals. At the end of the first quarter, we had strategic stocking positions in the key remote enablement categories to meet expected customer demand. During the second quarter, we continue to leverage our distribution centers extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationship and strong balance sheet and liquidity position, to successfully navigate supply challenges. We continue to procure supply in key remote enablement categories, and managed through longer lead times for others. Now let's take a deeper look at customer end market performance. Corporate and small business both declined double digit. As you know these channels include our small and medium business customers. The unique nature of the COVID-19 crisis has posed greater challenges for some small and medium businesses. Intra quarter net sales results decelerated each month as softer writing impacted subsequent month performance. During the quarter, corporate and small business customers spend was prioritized on three areas. First, remote work enablement and new use cases, driving notebook and mobile device spend. Second, infrastructure support and optimization which resulted in strong growth in cloud offering, and several software categories including security, network management and virtualization. And third, maximizing of past IT purchases and reduction in expenses through extended maintenance contracts and shorter commitments for new contracting licenses. The government team increased net sales 24%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up almost 50%. During the quarter our devices of service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau contributed meaningfully to our federal results. Field operations to collect data from non-responders has started. This solution will continue to be a meaningful contributor to federal net sales for the remainder of 2020. Excluding Census' results, federal was up healthy double digit. Growth was driven by civilian projects and demonstrated the team's great work delivering CDW's value proposition to multiple agencies. The team delivered strong transactional growth with almost 100% growth in notebooks, and double digit growth in enterprise storage, video, collaboration, hardware and security software. The state and local team delivered low single digit growth driven by double digit transactional growth that enabled remote work capabilities, including notebooks and collaboration hardware, software to enhance security and optimize technology assets and investments to accelerate e-government initiatives. Education increased 13% with strong double digit growth in K-12, and a mid-single digit decline in higher ed. In K-12, customers continue to focus on equity and access for students. K-12 growth was primarily driven by strong Chromebook results, as our team helped school districts prepare to start classes later this month or early next month in a variety of teaching format. Higher ed performance reflected the uncertainty that universities and colleges are facing. IT spending on remote enablement, such as notebooks and collaboration tools was strong. It was offset by delayed infrastructure projects due to budget concerns. Healthcare declined low double digits, with strong April results, followed by net sales declines in May and June, as COVID-related response efforts took priority and budget pressure intensified. Our team continue to work closely with healthcare customers on expanded virtual care capabilities, as healthcare delivery in the U.S. fundamentally changes. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations decreased 8% on a reported. The UK team delivered high single digit growth in constant currency with strong public sector demand, driven by healthcare customers and more muted corporate customer demand. Canada net sales decreased double digits in constant currency due to a higher mix of small business customers, who have been more impacted by COVID-19, and pressure on the oil and gas industry in Alberta. As you can see, our second quarter performance was varied across customer end market. This also drew a various performance across our major product and services categories. U.S. hardware was down mid-single digit. However, client devices grew almost 6%. Software declined low double digits and services grew mid-single digits. Transactions declined low single digits on top of last year's mid-teens growth. Solutions declined low double digits as some customers deprioritized infrastructure and larger project engagement. We delivered strong growth in our cloud offerings. Customers spend increased double digit, driven by strong growth in analytics, collaboration, data storage and recovery, compute and security. We expect strong customer demand for cloud offerings to continue. On July 1, we acquired IGNW, a leading provider of cloud native services expertise and software development capabilities. IGNW is a leader in digital velocity solutions, including advisory, consulting and development services, and has been a partner of CDW since 2018. IGNW presents an exciting growth opportunity for our business, our customers, our partners and our co-workers. It brings the right talent and strategic capabilities we want to deliver to our customers. We are pleased to welcome IGNW's approximately 170 co-workers to the CDW family. This is a great example of our continued investment in our cloud capabilities. M&A is an important part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDWs strategic capabilities. During our 35 plus year history, CDW had a successful track record of evolving customer needs in the IT industry, in part through acquisition. Our second quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end market, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. Let me take a moment to review each. First, our balanced portfolio customer end market. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels that each generated annual net sales of more than $1.5 billion in 2019. Corporate, small business, government, education and healthcare. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including federal government, state and local government, K-12 and higher education, providing us insights into our customers' objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered over $2 billion of net sales in 2019. The diversity of our customer end market serves us well, when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. This balance is especially relevant in the current environment. Next, our offerings are broad and deep, with over 100,000 products, services and solutions, from more than 1,000 vendor partners. We are well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT, and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. For example, in response to the current environment, customers have turned to us for return to work technology solutions beyond our traditional offerings, including enhanced video surveillance, temperature scanners and device sanitizing solutions. We now offer a full suite of IT enabled solutions to meet these demands. Our teams have productized different solutions for our various customer end markets. This is a great example of our thought leadership and ability to pivot to growth opportunities. And the final driver of our performance or three part strategy for growth, which is to first acquire new customers and capture share. Second, enhance our solutions capabilities. And third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want in need today and in the future. Today's environment doesn't impact our commitment to executing our strategy. In fact, it strengthens our resolve so we will emerge stronger than ever. So let me share a few examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers this quarter. A financial services company turned to our team to mobilize its employees to work from home. Only 30% of its workforce had worked from home capability. The customer delegated an emergency blanket purchase order for $3.5 million for our team to have full responsibility to develop the right solution across client devices, remote access, security and it's data centers. We leveraged our long standing relationships with the customer to get it right, and with our vendor partners to get supply. A large corporation was challenged with improving productivity for its remote employees. The customer needed to provide employees with additional IT equipment consistent with corporate standards, but did not have the systems in place to identify which employees required equipment, to place thousands of orders or to deliver the equipment to the employees homes. The customer returned to us due to our robust e-commerce platform and extensive logistics capabilities. Our team created a digital catalogue that integrated CDW and the customers' e-procurement system, making a complicated process simple. Through this project, we expanded the partners and products we sold to the customer. Our team did such a great job that the customer cancelled RFP midstream to award us another meaningful engagement. Another example of a 5,000 students school district in Ohio, turned to us to create a complete remote learning environment for its students. Our teams helped the district with client devices, and developed a collaboration platform for its teachers and students in the cloud. This is one of many examples from the quarter, where our teams helped customers with cloud collaboration tools. These examples also show how quickly solutions need to be implemented in this environment. Customers turn to us for expertise, thought leadership and a high level of customer service. We won a ServiceNow engagement for a leading medical school after two weeks sales cycle, less than half the typical cycle time, because of our past experience with this customer and our ability to deliver in a compressed timeframe. These examples highlight CDW's three part strategy for growth including CDW as a trusted advisor, and how IT is crucial to achieving our customers' objectives. I now want to update you on our efforts to manage COVID-19's impact on our business. As I shared previously, we have a cross functional response team in place. The team has three key principles, safeguard the health and well-being of our co-workers, serve the mission driven needs of our customers and support our communities. Our office co-workers are still working from home. We have excellent capabilities in the culture of collaboration, so co-worker engagement and productivity have been strong. We continue to evaluate when and how to return to the office and where and how our customers will work -- our co-workers will work in the future. All distribution and configuration centers are operational, and we maintain precautionary measures advised by public health authorities, including social distancing, segmented shifts, personal protective equipment, enhanced facility cleaning, and temperature scanners. These teams have done an exceptional job maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while taking the necessary precautions. During the quarter, more of our sellers and technical specialists began to reengage in-person with customers. We have taken proactive measures to keep the worker safe in these settings as well. Our teams have done a great job of adapting to virtual channels to ensure we reach our customers, and we continue to develop our co-workers. For example, our marketing and events transitioned from in-person to virtual, so customers could continue to learn from our technical experts. Also during the quarter, our sales and technical teams completed over 20,000 hours of training and earned over 400 certification, almost doubled last year's activity. Our marketing and events and co-worker services teams have done an excellent job adapting to the environment. They demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our culture, a culture we believe is important competitively to us. Let's turn now to the balance of the year. The economic outlook for the foreseeable future remains uncertain, as the duration and severity of COVID-19 are unknown and also uneven. Therefore, we are not providing 2020 targets. We continue to watch closely the near-term impact of COVID-19 on our customer end market. For Q3 to-date writing, the rate of decline has stabilized for our most impacted customer end market, and trends for more resilient customer end market continue. While encouraging, we believe it's premature to call this a trend as weekly writing do fluctuate. Customers are in various phases of responding to the macro environment. Some customers remain focused on remote enablement and operational continuity, others are moving forward with organizational efficiency and optimization, and other customers are investing behind digital transformation, including cloud migration and automation strategies. Our teams can help with all phases and will continue to be trusted partners to our customers, to help them smartly deploy their IQ resources and solve some of their toughest challenges. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors in the economy, and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy in place. We will help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape and adopt new technology. We are committed to investing in our three part growth strategy, including the capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity, and enhance our competitive position. We will also keep a watchful eye on the impact of COVID-19, the macro environment and other unpredictable variables, such as potential supply disruptions, trade policies, and upcoming U.S. elections. CDW will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers, address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out execute our competition. Now, Colin will share some more details on our financial performance. Collin?\nCollin Kebo: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our second quarter results, liquidity position and capital allocation priorities. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 9, consolidated net sales were $4.4 billion down 5.7% on a reported and average daily sales basis. In constant currency, consolidated net sales declined by 5.3%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 0.5% versus the first quarter. As expected, this was lower than historical seasonality due to the first quarter stronger than normal seasonality, and the ongoing impact of COVID-19. As Chris mentioned, our customer channels generally perform consistent with the demand and writings commentary shared on our last earnings call. April sales benefited from the carryover of strong demand in March, whereas May and June sales were impacted by lower demand in certain customer end markets. Pockets of supply dislocation continued in the quarter. And we leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure the IT products and solutions our customers needed, for remote enablement, operations continuity and resource optimization. Gross profit for the quarter was $747 million, a decline of 3.4%. Gross margin was 17.1%, up 40 basis points over last year, driven by product margin and by the mix of netted down revenues primarily software as a service. Turning to SG&A on Slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A decreased 1.5%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales payroll consistent with lower gross profit, reduced performance based compensation and cost savings measures including decreased travel and entertainment and ongoing productivity and efficiency efforts. The June 30, credit loss reserve balance decreased modestly versus the March 31, balance reflecting our customer collection experience in the quarter, a lower receivable balance at June quarter end and expectations for future collections. While we are generally pleased with second quarter's bad debt experience, we recognized that much economic uncertainty exists and remain cautious on year to go credit loss expectations. These expense reductions were partially offset by approximately $7 million of COVID-19 expenses, primarily to safeguard and compensate frontline co-workers. As we always do, we are closely monitoring our cost structure relative to the demand environment. Co-worker count at the end of the second quarter was 10,048, down 56 from the first quarter, reflecting restrictions on hiring and backfilling attrition that we put in place in April. Year-over-year co-worker count increased 265, with approximately 120 of the increase from the Atheros acquisition last fall, and the remaining from organic co-worker investments. Our recently completed acquisition of IGNW adds approximately 170 co-workers, most of whom are customer facing technical co-workers. GAAP operating income was $283 million down 5.6%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance was $338 million down 5.6%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%. Moving to Slide 11, interest expense was $40 million, down 1.8%. The incremental interest from the $600 million notes issued in April was offset by savings from a lower LIBOR rate on the term loan. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 12 was 22.9% in the quarter, compared to 24.7% last year. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $65 million last year. The rate decrease is primarily related to higher excess tax benefits and equity based compensation in 2020. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation, which is shown on Slide 13. For the quarter our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.9%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate. As you can see on Slide 14, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $144 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.31 down 1.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $225 million in the quarter, down 5.2% compared to last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.56 down 2.6% from last year. Turning to first-half results on Slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $8.8 billion, an increase of 1.9% on a reported basis and 1.1% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one extra selling day in the first-half of 2020. The extra selling day will reverse in Q4 when we have one fewer selling day compared to prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, first-half consolidated net sales were 1.5% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.5 billion up 4% and gross profit margin was 17.2% up 40 basis points. Non-GAAP operating income was $642 million for the first-half of 2020, down 0.5%. Net income was $357 million and non-GAAP net income was $425 million, up 0.5%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.94 up 3.4%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 21. Liquidity continues to be a top priority in the current environment. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $958 million and net debt was $2.9 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was roughly $2 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $468 million, as shown on Slide 22. This is higher than normal seasonality and above last year's $407 million, primarily due to tax payment timing. Last year, we made cash tax payments on April 15 and June 15. And this year, the comparable payments were made on July 15, after the end of the second quarter. Moving to Slide 23, the three month average cash conversion cycle is 25 days, up nine days from last year's second quarter. While cash collections were solid in the quarter, DSO increased seven days as we mix it into some larger public customers who can take longer to pay, and we have seen certain commercial customers extending payments. DIO increased four days, as we continue to invest in inventory to help our customers manage their IT projects with greater certainty of product availability. One of our greatest assets is our long-term customer relationships, and we know it's important to be there for customers during challenging times, like we were during the great recession. We will continue to balance managing customer\u2019s working capital needs, while appropriately managing risk. In the quarter, we returned $54 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and did not repurchase any stock. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 24, as I mentioned earlier, we remain focused on liquidity and our capital priorities remain the same as last quarter. Our priorities are, first, continue to pay the dividend. Today, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per common share, reflecting CDW\u2019s strong liquidity position in competence and the cash flow generation capability of the business. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We remained comfortable with the current target net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times for several reasons. One, we have no debt maturities in 2020 and just $57 million due in 2021. Two, the weighted average interest rate on the debt portfolio was 3.6%, so cash interest is manageable. And three, our debt capital structure is covenant like. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2 times below the low end of our target range. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of IGNW which closed after quarter end is a good example of this. IGNW is not expected to have a material impact on CDW's 2020 net sales and non-GAAP earnings per share. We remain actively evaluating targets and will seek to be opportunistic in this environment. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating in cultural fit and financial return, all within the context of liquidity at that point in time. Fourth, as I previously noted our share repurchase program remain suspended to enhance liquidity. The decision on when to resume stock buybacks continues to depend on several considerations, including the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and working capital, leverage and other potential uses of cash, such as M&A. Lastly on the topic of capital, we intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We have a CapEx like model, historically running around half a point of sales or slightly more. We believe it's important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity, and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. We previously withdrew our 2020 targets and will not be providing an updated financial outlook, but consistent with last quarter, I want to provide insights into what we're seeing roughly one month into the third quarter from a demand, supply and operating perspective. On the demand side, activity continues to be mixed across customer end markets. In corporate and small business, looking back to the second quarter for a moment, the year-over-year decline in writings peaked at over 20% in May or June depending on the channel. Consequently, preliminary July sales are down double-digits in both channels. July writings are down year-over-year with the declines less negative than the peak levels of May or June. While encouraging, as Chris mentioned, we believe it's premature to call this a trend as weekly writings have been volatile, and we expect commercial customers will be sensitive to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases and the potential economic implications. In public, preliminary July sales and July writings are up year-over-year, driven by continued strength in K-12 and parts of government, partially offset by healthcare where both preliminary sales and writings continue to be down. Our international businesses are generally seeing similar customer trends to last quarter. We expect to continue to mix into public channels, which could add some headwind to gross margin in the back-half of the year. On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a fluid environment with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. Notebook supply, particularly lower end devices such as Chromebooks is tight. We are also experiencing extended lead times in certain networking and server products. We are in constant contact with our vendor partners, whose manufacturing operations are generally back up and running. Free challenges have moderated, but we are still seeing some pricing surcharges and price increases on certain products, which we are generally passing along to customers. On the operating front, all distribution centers continue to be operational. Finally, I want to provide an update on the devices of service solution to the U.S. Census Bureau. The contribution to second quarter net sales was in line with expectations. We have now deployed all of the devices into the field. The period for which the devices will be used remains fluid, and we could see some net sales shift among the next three quarters. The team has done an outstanding job managing through a challenging environment to help the Census Bureau deliver its mission. From a financial perspective, this year, we now expect the Census to contribute up to approximately 160 basis points of incremental net sales growth over 2019. On an absolute basis, we currently expect the Census to contribute over 200 basis points of net sales in 2020. We will continue to provide updates on the Census as we progress through the second-half of 2020. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Jake to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start with a strategic question. I think about CDW's competitive advantage is at scale, we obviously saw strong cash flow in the quarter. And those things seem to be a major potential weapon in this environment, where the long tail of competitors in your fragmented industry are struggling. So, the question is how are you thinking about options to potentially play a little offense, while others are on defense? And maybe if you could specifically tie this into your goal to acquire new customers and update that on the quarter that would be helpful.\nChris Leahy: Sure. Good morning, Adam. Yes, we've accelerated. I think I mentioned this on the last call, we see this as an opportunity and we've accelerated our acquisition programs. If you look across the breadth of our competitive advantages, customers right now are looking for those who have the expertise to help, and I'll just say it very simply, figure it out. The world is moving very quickly. The mandate to evolve and transform from the digital perspective are moving quickly. The access to cash is not what it used to be. And so having a provider that has the scale can get the supply, has the relationship with the vendor partners, and equally has the spectrum of solutions and experts, who can help design and plan and move quickly to get from solution design and development to implementation has been very important, particularly for those customers that I mentioned, who are going on the offense, and who are accelerating their own strategies and digital needs. So, we are being aggressive in helping the customers that are in our base now. But we're equally being aggressive about finding customers, who are in need. The financial situation that we sit in the financial strength, the strength of our balance sheet has also been very important to customers, who want to ensure that they're working with an organization that is large and credible and is around for the long-term?\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. And a as a follow-up maybe Collin. And I just had a question operationally. Operating profit dollar decline essentially match the revenue decline. So there was very little decremental detrimental margin here. I know the variable cost structure probably helps, but portions of the business were down significantly. So, maybe you could just touch on the performance in the quarter and how we can think about decremental margin moving forward?\nCollin Kebo: Yes. Adam, there were -- if I understand your question, I think it was, why wasn't there more deleverage? There were a couple things that helped us in the quarter that I touched on in my prepared remarks. One was on the credit loss reserve. We ended up not booking any bad debt expense in the quarter. We just drew down against the reserve that we had previously established, and in fact, released a little bit of it just because of receivables balance had wound down. The second thing that happened in the quarter is we did true-up our performance based compensation accruals, based on full year estimates, and we took a half a year's benefit in the second quarter. So, I wouldn't expect those two things to continue as we move through the balance of the year.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you. Chris, you talked about the pace of decline and writing stabilizing so far in the third quarter. Just wondering, if you could spend a little bit more on that comment? And just how we should think about the timing lag between writing translating into shipment or revenue trends? And maybe more broadly, just hitting on the health of IT budget at this point as we're thinking about the balance of the year.\nChris Leahy: Hi, Matt. Sure. I'm pausing for a bit because, it's such a tapestry out there of customers. We have obviously diversified customer end markets. And even within the end markets very diversified customer base. So, if you take corporate for example, across industry across geography, and different areas are getting hit differently, so different geographies. You guys know oil and gas in the south suffering a little some of those customers. You've got tech in the West, not suffering as much. You've got the virus resurgence in some areas, and the concerns about retreating back to stay-at-home orders. So, there's a number of layers that various customers are dealing with. And what I would say is it's hard to paint a picture, a single picture of where IT budgets are going. That said, we are having robust conversations with all of our customers, those that are spending today and those who are planning tomorrow. So, how budgets work? It's really going to be a reflection on the economy in this health crisis, which we continue to believe is just unpredictable. There's not a lot of visibility there. That said and back to your writings question, we watch writings daily and weekly. And we've had a couple of weeks of stability, as I said. But it can also be a little bit volatile. So, we watch it very carefully, that will typically turn into revenue in the next 30 to 60 days is how we think about the impact of the timing. But what I would leave you with is, technology is the top of everybody's minds. And for those customers that are focused on just surviving, they've got rent to pay, they've got payroll to pay. They're not going to be paying for IT right now. But we are talking with those customers about what's to come in the next quarter and beyond.\nMatt Cabral: Got it. And then, I think I heard in the prepared remarks solutions are down double digits. Just wondering if you dig a little bit more into the categories underneath there, and talk about where you're seeing the biggest headwinds. I guess I'm curious, your perspective on how much is just near-term projects being deferred versus maybe customers starting to reevaluate their broader on-premise footprint as cloud adoption is starting to pick-up a little bit?\nChris Leahy: Yes, that's a fair question. I think, at a high level, Matt, what we've seen is a real refocus on the urgency of remote work, optimizing employees working remotely, really bolstering those capabilities over the last couple of quarters. At the same time, we absolutely are seeing acceleration in discussions towards cloud and moving towards the cloud. In terms of on-prem, we've said and we'll say it again, that we believe that there's going to be a hybrid world out there. It continues to be a hybrid world. And we're having those kinds of conversations with our customers. So, assessing options for cloud, what to migrate, how to migrate, what cloud vendors to choose. The good news is we've got the ability to help our customers through cloud deployments, and then manage once they're up and running. But we still think there's going to be a lot of on-prem opportunity going forward. It's going to be more of a multi cloud hybrid cloud situation.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good morning guys. I have just two questions as well. First off maybe on the gross margin performance, it was fairly impressive given the discussion we just had on solutions and the frontline devices did well. So could you maybe walk through kind of what drove the gross margin upside year-over-year, if it's sustainable as we go forward?\nCollin Kebo: Sure. Amit, I can start on that one. Product margin held up pretty well, and we did get some benefit from mixing into software as a service. On the product margin within there, I would say in a supply constrained environment in particular categories, the margins can be a little bit firmer. And then within products, there's mix. So, for example, desktops happened to be weak in the quarter, they tend to be lower margin. So, within that product, we did see some lower margin. I think in terms of the outlook, as always difficult to predict because there are a lot of moving factors. I did say in my prepared comments that I do think that we will mix more into public as we move into the back-half of the year. Q3 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for both government and education. And given what's happening in education today, I would expect it to be quite strong. And then, where we do see a little bit more firmness on the commercial side of the business tends to be in the larger, better capitalized customers, which tend to have a little thinner margin. So, we were pleased with margin performance in the quarter, just cautious as we think about it over the back-half of the year.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's helpful. And then, I was hoping to get your perspective on client devices of PCs, I guess, as you go into the back-half of the year, I think, you guys mentioned it was up 6% in June, if I'm not mistaken. And of the industry data centers suggest that this may remain somewhat stronger for a couple of more quarters. So, I'd just love to understand how you guys think about the segment in the back-half? And if you were indeed able to meet all the demand within client devices for the June quarter.\nChris Leahy: Yes. So Amit, the client device obviously was very strong and we did take strategic inventory position, so that we were able to meet demand as we moved through the first and the second quarter. Look, as we said before, pre-COVID we thought we were kind of in the late innings around PC refresh and the Win10 upgrade. And so that will continue. So, if we think about going forward, certainly work from home, we think will be a trend [Indiscernible]. It will be -- we think, fundamentally how people work in the office and at home will be a lasting and durable change. How people learn from home will be a durable change, and those will be opportunities for client. And we've got devices that were out there past three, four years ago now, 2017, where there might be refresh opportunities there. Obviously, the economic environment and employment would have an impact on that. But we've always said, we've expected moderated growth. And I think that we're looking at the same way going forward. I'm sorry, Collin, did you want to add something?\nCollin Kebo: Yes, the only thing I was going to add is, and I think you know this. When you look at industry data points, you just need to make sure you're comparing apples to apples at what point in the supply chain you're measuring. So, I think some of those industry sources are OEM shipments into the channel and distributors and retailers and others like that. So, there's a little bit of the lag in that. Obviously, we saw very strong growth in client devices in the first quarter and in April as we shift against our backlog. So some of these shipments you're seeing are effectively replenishing lower levels of inventory further downstream in the supply chain that had been pretty well depleted.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. That\u2019s really a fair point. Sorry, go ahead.\nChris Leahy: Yes. Amit, I was just going to say, in the supply chain, we are seeing some delays, particularly in the lower end Chromebook space. So that will make its way through the supply chain over the next few months. But that's happening as well.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate you're not providing guidance for the year. But do you expect the same business model mechanics to play out in terms of growing 200 to 300 basis points faster than the market? Our survey work points to maybe 4% to 5% declines for the year. Is that also the ballpark of what you see in the data? And then I have a follow-up?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Katy, I\u2019ll start. I think what we see is there a variety of data points around GDP and IT growth. What I would say is we do expect ourselves -- we do hold ourselves accountable to outgrow the market by a meaningful amount. As you know, typically when we have a more robust environment and we are selling more hardware, which we recognize at the topline, that's when we tend to outgrow by the 200 to 300, sometimes higher basis points. When it's in an environment that's more like the one we're in recessionary and customers are doing things like extending the useful life of their assets, with warranties that net down and other things that are netted down, we will continue to outpace the market, but typically it's by a slightly lower margin, 100 to 200, 250 basis points.\nKaty Huberty: Do you have a view as -- do you survey your customers and have a view as to what you think the IT spending decline will look like this year?\nChris Leahy: We don't have a collective view that we're sharing. There are so many data points out there that are so desperate. I mean there's such a wide variation that we're listening to our customers and just taking every opportunity to help serve them and grow our business where we can, and support our customers so that they can grow coming out of this recession.\nKaty Huberty: Okay. That makes sense. And then just one other clarification. When you referenced some early stability in writings in July, when you say stable, is that -- do you mean flat year-on-year? Or you mean the rate of decline is stable from what you saw in the June quarter or the month of June?\nCollin Kebo: Just to clarify, I think what I was trying to do in my comments was particularly the commercial side of the business in corporate and small business give an indication of the peak decline we saw in the second quarter. So in May or June, those writings declined over 20% in both corporate and small business. What we're seeing in the month of July is that they are not as negative as those peak declines we saw earlier. So, it's a relative to what we had been seeing in the business statement.\nKaty Huberty: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Chris, I just wanted to clarify, are the trends that you're seeing in corporate and small business customers -- is that playing out as you had expected 90 days ago? Or are the trends better or worse than you expected? And any change to your outlook for the next couple of quarters?\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Ruplu. Thanks for the question. And I would say the trends are playing out, as we expected and as we shared with you. You remember last recession 2009, we talked through what we saw there. And it was a faster reaction by our small and medium sized businesses. In particular, they reacted more quickly to the economic downturn. And that is what we saw here. Now we have, as I mentioned, a diversified customer base even within small and corporate. And so, even within that, we saw some of the customers in certain industries, hospitality and things like that, who were suffering a little more, others who were actually being very aggressive in their strategies. The other thing is when you think about, as I mentioned, the uniqueness of what we're going through with the virus, and the fits and starts if you will, in different geographies, that's also tending to have an impact on our customers. But all of that said, I'd say that the trends played out as we expected. Look, small business channels are going to be impacted by economics, and they're going to focus on what they need to do to survive first and then invest for the future. So, what I'd say is it's really affirms our business diversification strategy, and provide optimism and the competence of our business model. If you think about what we were able to deliver, our free cash flow through the year is at $470 million. We've paid our dividend. We're continuing to invest in the evolution of CDW going forward. We've got other customer segments that are going very strong, given the demand in the market. And I'm really proud of how the team is managing through this.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details on that, Chris. I appreciate it. One question for you Collin, how should we think about SG&A as a percentage of sales going forward? Right now, you mentioned you've got reduced performance based comp and travel is less and you've enacted cost savings measures. But as lockdowns get relaxed, how should we think about SG&A? Can you hold the line? Or should we expect OpEx to trend upwards? Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. I mean, we're not going to provide a specific guide on SG&A. As you know, we do have a variable cost structure. So there are elements of it, variable sales compensation that will move with our gross profit. And then we have put hiring restrictions in place and continue to let attrition run, so that'll add a little bit of variability. And then we've taken other cost savings measures. And the other point I would make Ruplu is, we are not managing to a short-term SG&A target here, as I think we've been communicating pretty consistently. We do think that this is an opportunity to invest and get stronger in this. And so, we're going to take a balanced approach and that we are going to continue to invest both in CapEx and OpEx. But having said all that, we are mindful of the demand environment, and we\u2019ll take a balanced approach and ensure we have an appropriate cost structure.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details and congrats on the quarter.\nCollin Kebo: Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. My first is just regarding what you\u2019re seeing in terms of extended maintenance sort of contract terms? Can you give us some perspective on how the magnitude of this. And maybe if you can go back to other times when the economy has been under pressure, if you kind of talk about how this compares. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. We are seeing customers, particularly those who are looking to save cash move into shorter duration maintenance contracts, as opposed to going to multi-years, those that are paying on for software a number of seats and things like that, looking at true-ups and things like that. It\u2019s difficult to compare to previous times, Shannon. I think back in 2009, we saw a similar behavior and then when we experienced a bit of a slowdown in the \u201915 \u201916 period, we saw customer sweating assets at that point in time. Maybe a little bit more pronounced today than it was back in \u201915 \u201916, but I think that\u2019s logical just given the severity of the crisis relative to the slowdown we saw back then.\nChris Leahy: Shannon, I would just add that our managed services capabilities are more robust now. And so, these conversations with customers in terms of service contracts and potentially shortening them have also led to some robust conversations about managed services and some wins for us in managed services as a result of those conversations.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you. And then, how do we think about education budgets? I'm just trying to understand, obviously all of these school districts are now -- well, not all, but a lot of school districts are going to hybrid model, clearly there are a lot of kids out there who don\u2019t have access to Chromebooks or who\u2019re just getting access now. So, I'm wondering what you\u2019re hearing from the school districts in terms of the state of their budgets? And then also how are you thinking about -- and I know there\u2019s a lot of talk regarding the magnitude of the stimulus bill when and if it ever gets decided. But how quickly does sort of federal funding tend to run through? I'm just trying to get an idea of what we might see in the next year months frankly. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes. Shannon, on the education side K-12 in particular, they are accessing funding and we\u2019re helping them with that. So funds are flowing. And they are really all hands on deck, trying to get devices into the hands of students. And so, there\u2019s a lot of activity there regarding client devices, remote enablement as well as what we call kind of broadcasting from the school. It\u2019s very complicated and we had a highly seasoned sales organization that works with the schools. But the breadth of the solutions that we\u2019re looking for are fulsome as I mentioned in my remarks, all the way from thermal scanning and sanitation stations to dividers and carts and things that CDW can just help them provide, so that they have kind of turnkey solutions. But there is strong demand to get the kids in the classroom environment, whether virtual or hybrid as quickly as possible. So, there\u2019s a lot of pressure there and they are accessing funds. In higher ed, we\u2019re seeing some falls on the budget side. Obviously, they've got concerns around various revenue streams. And the solutions provided in the business there in terms of on campus robust network support, et cetera has been falling a little bit. But we are starting to see a pick up when it comes to remote enablement and devices and would expect that to continue as the school gets sorted out, coming into this September-October timeframe. In terms of the timing of funds flowing through, I don\u2019t have a particular timeframe that I would know how to share, But I would say, they\u2019re moving a little faster than I would have expected in some areas. And again, our teams are really excited, figuring out where they\u2019re going to flow, how they\u2019re going to flow and how to make sure you write up the order so that the funds can apply. But they are flowing, and I would expect the same would happen with any new build that we see that makes it true.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Ted Starck-King with William Blair.\nTed Starck-King: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I want to follow-up on one of the earlier questions on new clients. Can you talk about sales productivity and the ability to win new clients in this environment? And then maybe also around kind of a customer retention rates, both historically and what you're seeing today?\nChris Leahy: Hi. Ted. Yes. On acquisition and new clients, we haven't really shared specific information about numbers of acquisition and penetration rate. But I would say that it has not been relatively harder, because we are remote. Because we've moved all of our marketing, for example, to digital channels. So, we're reaching more customers and we're reaching more people within customers, and taking the opportunity to follow-up. So, we've, retooled how we put together acquisition programs to be as effective as possible. Our sellers are really quite amazing in their ability to connect with people and develop relationships, virtually. And as I did mention, we do have sellers who are now more out in the field with customers as well. But I've been really pleased with how they've been able to transition and the aggressiveness or the assertiveness and the success with our acquisition programs right now. And the second question, Ted, was around retention. Yes, we don't -- that's not a number that we share. But I would say that the customer satisfaction in this current environment has been really quite high, what we measure from the satisfaction perspective.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. Ted, I would just add, I mean, it's difficult in this environment, particularly for the most challenged customers who are looking to preserve liquidity, they're pulling back. So, they may not be spending period versus not spending with CDW. I think in an environment like this, consistent with our remarks, we are staying in front of our customers, even those that may not be spending. And I think if there's wallet to be had, we're getting our fair share of that.\nTed Starck-King: Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up question. So, on that note, are you guys flexing some of your financing offerings for customers? And how would that kind of make its way through the P&L? Thanks.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. When you say the note, you mean the notes we issued in April, those were for general corporate purposes to enhance our liquidity as well as to make sure we have sufficient working capital to support our customers. I would say one act area that we're very active in is working with our customers and helping them understand the variety of vendor partner financing programs that are out there. And that's where we start and many of our OEMs have been quite aggressive in terms of providing attractive financing, and we are seeing a pretty material uptake on that from our customers. So, the nice thing about that is, it doesn't flow through our financials. As I mentioned, there are some instances though, where we are investing in inventory for customers, or have seen terms pick up a bit and that's where you would see it in our working capital.\nTed Starck-King: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask just about, again about the public sector, specifically the state and local government, which has been I know, a strong, fast growing market for you. What are the trends you're seeing there? And are there concerns about budget cuts just due to lower revenue and lower state taxes?\nChris Leahy: Hi, Matt. Yes, there are concerns. Certainly, we talked about that in the last call budget concerns. But again, we are finding that in the state and local area. Budgets are being prioritized against IT initiatives, both work from home and also that various projects, government e-projects that are in flight. The hope and expectation is we will see in a stimulus package some sort of relief for state and local governments. And again, we hope that governments figure out where to get that. But they are struggling a bit now, but continuing to spend on the IT needs that's been prioritized and essential for their workforce and for their mission.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thanks. And relative to the healthcare space, which had been a market that turned around for you. I know last year you saw some positive trends, and obviously budget shifts there has impacted demand near-term. But in terms of conversations you're having with customers in that sector, do you still expect those investments towards digital transformation to still occur at some point?\nChris Leahy: I do, Matt. Look, healthcare literally caused the global pandemic virus, and protected all of us and has been protecting all of us. But, they've been forced to see revenue generating businesses or at least diminish them. And I'm confident, given the demographic trends and changes that have already taken place regarding loosening regulations and accelerating digital transformation, that it will result in a strong recovery and long-term growth in the healthcare end market. And we are having extensive conversations with our healthcare systems around virtual care, across all spectrums. You've got telehealth and telemedicine, virtual rounding, you've got remote patient monitoring and then you've got enhanced patient monitoring in places like the ICU. And all of those require slightly different sorts of solutions. And we are building those out for some customers already. But I do see that as a long-term positive trend.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. In terms of the overall capital strategy right now in terms of M&A. How does M&A fall in terms of your priority of this thing? Are you seeing an opportunity for some add-ons that can perhaps benefit the future?\nChris Leahy: Well, we just -- I'll start and Collin, you can jump in if you like. Yes, we just did an acquisition of IGNW, and that's made of cloud services provider. That's a great example of investing our capital behind our strategy of developing the solutions and services that our customers need now and in the future. So, we absolutely will continue to look at potential targets. And we're very active in inbounds, we're very active in outbound. And this organization IGNW like Aptris is a partner that CDW had worked with some time. So, we got to know them very well. We got to know the people and the quality and the culture and their capabilities. So, we will continue to look in the market for opportunistic acquisitions.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. In terms of prioritization, liquidity is our top priority, but we have $2 billion of it. So, we feel really good about where we are. The dividend is a priority. We just declared that. And again, given the cash flow generation capability of the business, feel good about that. We're below our target leverage, sitting at 2 times. So our next priority is M&A. And so, if we find the right opportunity at the right price, we'll take the opportunity to enhance our competitive position in this environment.\nKeith Housum: Great. I appreciate that. And then just turning over to the public sector, obviously, that's an area that usually declines in the fourth quarter. But my understanding, especially in the Chromebook area, there's a significant delay in [indiscernible] the market. Based on that combined with approach to going hybrid schooling that a lot of businesses are taking. Is there an expectation that public will actually have a good rest second-half of the year, including the fourth quarter?\nCollin Kebo: I mean, we're not going to -- in normal times, we wouldn't guide by channel, and certainly in the current environment, we're not going to. I think you can tell from our comments on the second quarter and writings and comments about where we think the mid-business is going to mix into the second-half of the year, that the demand is more resilient on the public side, particularly federal government education. You did call out Chromebooks. We are keeping an eye on that. Supply is tight there, given the extraordinary demand. And that's a little bit of a wild card that we've see in the third or fourth quarter. But given the breadth of our vendor partners and our scale, we think we'll be able to manage that as well as anyone. Not that there may not be disruption, but in terms of customers looking for supply, we think CDW can help them given our multi vendors. We're also having conversations with customers around alternative processors and things like that. So we're doing what we can to get creative, to get supply for our customers to help them through the Chromebook shortage.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: Hi, this is Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just to drill in on your SMB segment. Can you kind of give us a sense for the overall health of these customers? Are you seeing more sales kind of postponed or cancelled? And are most customers kind of paying on time as well? And, any verticals or regions you want to call out that you're seeing a little bit more signs of life?\nChris Leahy: Well, yes.\nCollin Kebo: Yes, I mean, in terms of writings, I think the commentary we provided on writings for small business gives you a good overview of the demand environment. Obviously, within that you have industries that are relatively stronger, and those are a little bit more challenged. And even within industries, you have some winners and losers. On the cash collections front, I would say we were generally pleased with the pace of cash collections from our commercial customers, including our small business customers. We do have a long tail of small customers that we're keeping an eye on that portion of the credit portfolio. But, overall, I would say the collections held up reasonably well in the quarter.\nPaul Chung: Thanks. And then just to follow-up on free cash. Very nice performance there kind of despite softer topline and higher CapEx levels. It looks like you had a bit of working cap benefit in the quarter. Can you just talk about the puts and takes on operating cash? And how we should think about trends heading into the second-half, even despite the tough macro? Also on CapEx levels, I assume that level comes down in the second-half? Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. In terms of working capital, I think one of the dynamics you would expect to see is when the business shrinks that we would liquidate some working capital, and you did see that dynamic play out in the quarter. That was partially offset though, by seeing the cash conversion cycle tick up a bit. I think the other thing to keep in mind as you think about free cash flow, we did get some timing favorability in terms of cash taxes. We didn't make a payment in the second quarter and historically, it's one of our biggest quarterly payments, and that reversed a little bit. In terms of CapEx, you're right, it is a little bit heavier, front end loaded this year. You might recall that some of the Census devices that we procure for our device as a service offering or running through CapEx. With all of those devices out in the field, now we are virtually done with additional capital expenditures for the Census. So, those are some things to think about and the puts and takes of free cash flow and working capital.\nPaul Chung: Thank you so much.\nCollin Kebo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris Leahy.\nChris Leahy: Okay. Thank you. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the many continued challenges due to COVID-19, and to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices and contributions being made by so many who are devoting themselves to serving others. I also want to recognize the remarkable dedication of our co-workers around the globe, and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. They continuously impressed me, and reaffirm my conviction that we will emerge stronger from this. Thank you. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and the opportunity to serve you during these times. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining. That now concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of second quarter results and drivers of performance. I'll provide our perspectives on the current macro environment, its impact on our customers and market and how we are responding. Collin, will then take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. For the second quarter net sales were $4.4 billion, 5.7% below last year and down 5.3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $338 million, a decrease of 5.6%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.56, 2.6% below last year on a reported basis and down 2.3% in constant currency. For the quarter net sales performance varied by month and by customer end market. As we shared on our last earnings call, we entered April with a healthy backlog of remote workforce enablement solution, which contributed to strong performance in April. As the quarter progressed, for some of our customer end markets projects were postponed and demand declined, as the economic toll of the crisis impacted customer spend. In other customer end markets, IT investment was prioritized and remained healthy. During the quarter, we helped customers across a spectrum of IT priorities, remote enablement, business and operations continuity and security remain top customer focus areas to manage remote environments at scale, and to prepare to work and learn from home in some capacity for longer. Customers also focus on initiatives to reduce cost, optimize resources, and leverage technology for better customer and employee experiences through digital transformation. CDW teams orchestrated turnkey solutions from our broad portfolio of clients' devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security, software and cloud offering to help customers build these capabilities and achieve their goals. At the end of the first quarter, we had strategic stocking positions in the key remote enablement categories to meet expected customer demand. During the second quarter, we continue to leverage our distribution centers extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationship and strong balance sheet and liquidity position, to successfully navigate supply challenges. We continue to procure supply in key remote enablement categories, and managed through longer lead times for others. Now let's take a deeper look at customer end market performance. Corporate and small business both declined double digit. As you know these channels include our small and medium business customers. The unique nature of the COVID-19 crisis has posed greater challenges for some small and medium businesses. Intra quarter net sales results decelerated each month as softer writing impacted subsequent month performance. During the quarter, corporate and small business customers spend was prioritized on three areas. First, remote work enablement and new use cases, driving notebook and mobile device spend. Second, infrastructure support and optimization which resulted in strong growth in cloud offering, and several software categories including security, network management and virtualization. And third, maximizing of past IT purchases and reduction in expenses through extended maintenance contracts and shorter commitments for new contracting licenses. The government team increased net sales 24%. Federal delivered another excellent quarter with net sales up almost 50%. During the quarter our devices of service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau contributed meaningfully to our federal results. Field operations to collect data from non-responders has started. This solution will continue to be a meaningful contributor to federal net sales for the remainder of 2020. Excluding Census' results, federal was up healthy double digit. Growth was driven by civilian projects and demonstrated the team's great work delivering CDW's value proposition to multiple agencies. The team delivered strong transactional growth with almost 100% growth in notebooks, and double digit growth in enterprise storage, video, collaboration, hardware and security software. The state and local team delivered low single digit growth driven by double digit transactional growth that enabled remote work capabilities, including notebooks and collaboration hardware, software to enhance security and optimize technology assets and investments to accelerate e-government initiatives. Education increased 13% with strong double digit growth in K-12, and a mid-single digit decline in higher ed. In K-12, customers continue to focus on equity and access for students. K-12 growth was primarily driven by strong Chromebook results, as our team helped school districts prepare to start classes later this month or early next month in a variety of teaching format. Higher ed performance reflected the uncertainty that universities and colleges are facing. IT spending on remote enablement, such as notebooks and collaboration tools was strong. It was offset by delayed infrastructure projects due to budget concerns. Healthcare declined low double digits, with strong April results, followed by net sales declines in May and June, as COVID-related response efforts took priority and budget pressure intensified. Our team continue to work closely with healthcare customers on expanded virtual care capabilities, as healthcare delivery in the U.S. fundamentally changes. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations decreased 8% on a reported. The UK team delivered high single digit growth in constant currency with strong public sector demand, driven by healthcare customers and more muted corporate customer demand. Canada net sales decreased double digits in constant currency due to a higher mix of small business customers, who have been more impacted by COVID-19, and pressure on the oil and gas industry in Alberta. As you can see, our second quarter performance was varied across customer end market. This also drew a various performance across our major product and services categories. U.S. hardware was down mid-single digit. However, client devices grew almost 6%. Software declined low double digits and services grew mid-single digits. Transactions declined low single digits on top of last year's mid-teens growth. Solutions declined low double digits as some customers deprioritized infrastructure and larger project engagement. We delivered strong growth in our cloud offerings. Customers spend increased double digit, driven by strong growth in analytics, collaboration, data storage and recovery, compute and security. We expect strong customer demand for cloud offerings to continue. On July 1, we acquired IGNW, a leading provider of cloud native services expertise and software development capabilities. IGNW is a leader in digital velocity solutions, including advisory, consulting and development services, and has been a partner of CDW since 2018. IGNW presents an exciting growth opportunity for our business, our customers, our partners and our co-workers. It brings the right talent and strategic capabilities we want to deliver to our customers. We are pleased to welcome IGNW's approximately 170 co-workers to the CDW family. This is a great example of our continued investment in our cloud capabilities. M&A is an important part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDWs strategic capabilities. During our 35 plus year history, CDW had a successful track record of evolving customer needs in the IT industry, in part through acquisition. Our second quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end market, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. Let me take a moment to review each. First, our balanced portfolio customer end market. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels that each generated annual net sales of more than $1.5 billion in 2019. Corporate, small business, government, education and healthcare. This scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end markets, including federal government, state and local government, K-12 and higher education, providing us insights into our customers' objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered over $2 billion of net sales in 2019. The diversity of our customer end market serves us well, when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. This balance is especially relevant in the current environment. Next, our offerings are broad and deep, with over 100,000 products, services and solutions, from more than 1,000 vendor partners. We are well positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT, and can pivot quickly to trends in customer demand. For example, in response to the current environment, customers have turned to us for return to work technology solutions beyond our traditional offerings, including enhanced video surveillance, temperature scanners and device sanitizing solutions. We now offer a full suite of IT enabled solutions to meet these demands. Our teams have productized different solutions for our various customer end markets. This is a great example of our thought leadership and ability to pivot to growth opportunities. And the final driver of our performance or three part strategy for growth, which is to first acquire new customers and capture share. Second, enhance our solutions capabilities. And third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want in need today and in the future. Today's environment doesn't impact our commitment to executing our strategy. In fact, it strengthens our resolve so we will emerge stronger than ever. So let me share a few examples of our strategy in action and how we helped customers this quarter. A financial services company turned to our team to mobilize its employees to work from home. Only 30% of its workforce had worked from home capability. The customer delegated an emergency blanket purchase order for $3.5 million for our team to have full responsibility to develop the right solution across client devices, remote access, security and it's data centers. We leveraged our long standing relationships with the customer to get it right, and with our vendor partners to get supply. A large corporation was challenged with improving productivity for its remote employees. The customer needed to provide employees with additional IT equipment consistent with corporate standards, but did not have the systems in place to identify which employees required equipment, to place thousands of orders or to deliver the equipment to the employees homes. The customer returned to us due to our robust e-commerce platform and extensive logistics capabilities. Our team created a digital catalogue that integrated CDW and the customers' e-procurement system, making a complicated process simple. Through this project, we expanded the partners and products we sold to the customer. Our team did such a great job that the customer cancelled RFP midstream to award us another meaningful engagement. Another example of a 5,000 students school district in Ohio, turned to us to create a complete remote learning environment for its students. Our teams helped the district with client devices, and developed a collaboration platform for its teachers and students in the cloud. This is one of many examples from the quarter, where our teams helped customers with cloud collaboration tools. These examples also show how quickly solutions need to be implemented in this environment. Customers turn to us for expertise, thought leadership and a high level of customer service. We won a ServiceNow engagement for a leading medical school after two weeks sales cycle, less than half the typical cycle time, because of our past experience with this customer and our ability to deliver in a compressed timeframe. These examples highlight CDW's three part strategy for growth including CDW as a trusted advisor, and how IT is crucial to achieving our customers' objectives. I now want to update you on our efforts to manage COVID-19's impact on our business. As I shared previously, we have a cross functional response team in place. The team has three key principles, safeguard the health and well-being of our co-workers, serve the mission driven needs of our customers and support our communities. Our office co-workers are still working from home. We have excellent capabilities in the culture of collaboration, so co-worker engagement and productivity have been strong. We continue to evaluate when and how to return to the office and where and how our customers will work -- our co-workers will work in the future. All distribution and configuration centers are operational, and we maintain precautionary measures advised by public health authorities, including social distancing, segmented shifts, personal protective equipment, enhanced facility cleaning, and temperature scanners. These teams have done an exceptional job maintaining the high level of customer service we are known for, while taking the necessary precautions. During the quarter, more of our sellers and technical specialists began to reengage in-person with customers. We have taken proactive measures to keep the worker safe in these settings as well. Our teams have done a great job of adapting to virtual channels to ensure we reach our customers, and we continue to develop our co-workers. For example, our marketing and events transitioned from in-person to virtual, so customers could continue to learn from our technical experts. Also during the quarter, our sales and technical teams completed over 20,000 hours of training and earned over 400 certification, almost doubled last year's activity. Our marketing and events and co-worker services teams have done an excellent job adapting to the environment. They demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our culture, a culture we believe is important competitively to us. Let's turn now to the balance of the year. The economic outlook for the foreseeable future remains uncertain, as the duration and severity of COVID-19 are unknown and also uneven. Therefore, we are not providing 2020 targets. We continue to watch closely the near-term impact of COVID-19 on our customer end market. For Q3 to-date writing, the rate of decline has stabilized for our most impacted customer end market, and trends for more resilient customer end market continue. While encouraging, we believe it's premature to call this a trend as weekly writing do fluctuate. Customers are in various phases of responding to the macro environment. Some customers remain focused on remote enablement and operational continuity, others are moving forward with organizational efficiency and optimization, and other customers are investing behind digital transformation, including cloud migration and automation strategies. Our teams can help with all phases and will continue to be trusted partners to our customers, to help them smartly deploy their IQ resources and solve some of their toughest challenges. We believe that technology will be more essential to all sectors in the economy, and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy in place. We will help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape and adopt new technology. We are committed to investing in our three part growth strategy, including the capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity, and enhance our competitive position. We will also keep a watchful eye on the impact of COVID-19, the macro environment and other unpredictable variables, such as potential supply disruptions, trade policies, and upcoming U.S. elections. CDW will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers, address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out execute our competition. Now, Colin will share some more details on our financial performance. Collin? Sure. Good morning, Adam. Yes, we've accelerated. I think I mentioned this on the last call, we see this as an opportunity and we've accelerated our acquisition programs. If you look across the breadth of our competitive advantages, customers right now are looking for those who have the expertise to help, and I'll just say it very simply, figure it out. The world is moving very quickly. The mandate to evolve and transform from the digital perspective are moving quickly. The access to cash is not what it used to be. And so having a provider that has the scale can get the supply, has the relationship with the vendor partners, and equally has the spectrum of solutions and experts, who can help design and plan and move quickly to get from solution design and development to implementation has been very important, particularly for those customers that I mentioned, who are going on the offense, and who are accelerating their own strategies and digital needs. So, we are being aggressive in helping the customers that are in our base now. But we're equally being aggressive about finding customers, who are in need. The financial situation that we sit in the financial strength, the strength of our balance sheet has also been very important to customers, who want to ensure that they're working with an organization that is large and credible and is around for the long-term? Hi, Matt. Sure. I'm pausing for a bit because, it's such a tapestry out there of customers. We have obviously diversified customer end markets. And even within the end markets very diversified customer base. So, if you take corporate for example, across industry across geography, and different areas are getting hit differently, so different geographies. You guys know oil and gas in the south suffering a little some of those customers. You've got tech in the West, not suffering as much. You've got the virus resurgence in some areas, and the concerns about retreating back to stay-at-home orders. So, there's a number of layers that various customers are dealing with. And what I would say is it's hard to paint a picture, a single picture of where IT budgets are going. That said, we are having robust conversations with all of our customers, those that are spending today and those who are planning tomorrow. So, how budgets work? It's really going to be a reflection on the economy in this health crisis, which we continue to believe is just unpredictable. There's not a lot of visibility there. That said and back to your writings question, we watch writings daily and weekly. And we've had a couple of weeks of stability, as I said. But it can also be a little bit volatile. So, we watch it very carefully, that will typically turn into revenue in the next 30 to 60 days is how we think about the impact of the timing. But what I would leave you with is, technology is the top of everybody's minds. And for those customers that are focused on just surviving, they've got rent to pay, they've got payroll to pay. They're not going to be paying for IT right now. But we are talking with those customers about what's to come in the next quarter and beyond. Yes, that's a fair question. I think, at a high level, Matt, what we've seen is a real refocus on the urgency of remote work, optimizing employees working remotely, really bolstering those capabilities over the last couple of quarters. At the same time, we absolutely are seeing acceleration in discussions towards cloud and moving towards the cloud. In terms of on-prem, we've said and we'll say it again, that we believe that there's going to be a hybrid world out there. It continues to be a hybrid world. And we're having those kinds of conversations with our customers. So, assessing options for cloud, what to migrate, how to migrate, what cloud vendors to choose. The good news is we've got the ability to help our customers through cloud deployments, and then manage once they're up and running. But we still think there's going to be a lot of on-prem opportunity going forward. It's going to be more of a multi cloud hybrid cloud situation. Yes. So Amit, the client device obviously was very strong and we did take strategic inventory position, so that we were able to meet demand as we moved through the first and the second quarter. Look, as we said before, pre-COVID we thought we were kind of in the late innings around PC refresh and the Win10 upgrade. And so that will continue. So, if we think about going forward, certainly work from home, we think will be a trend [Indiscernible]. It will be -- we think, fundamentally how people work in the office and at home will be a lasting and durable change. How people learn from home will be a durable change, and those will be opportunities for client. And we've got devices that were out there past three, four years ago now, 2017, where there might be refresh opportunities there. Obviously, the economic environment and employment would have an impact on that. But we've always said, we've expected moderated growth. And I think that we're looking at the same way going forward. I'm sorry, Collin, did you want to add something? Yes. Amit, I was just going to say, in the supply chain, we are seeing some delays, particularly in the lower end Chromebook space. So that will make its way through the supply chain over the next few months. But that's happening as well. Yes. Katy, I'll start. I think what we see is there a variety of data points around GDP and IT growth. What I would say is we do expect ourselves -- we do hold ourselves accountable to outgrow the market by a meaningful amount. As you know, typically when we have a more robust environment and we are selling more hardware, which we recognize at the topline, that's when we tend to outgrow by the 200 to 300, sometimes higher basis points. When it's in an environment that's more like the one we're in recessionary and customers are doing things like extending the useful life of their assets, with warranties that net down and other things that are netted down, we will continue to outpace the market, but typically it's by a slightly lower margin, 100 to 200, 250 basis points. We don't have a collective view that we're sharing. There are so many data points out there that are so desperate. I mean there's such a wide variation that we're listening to our customers and just taking every opportunity to help serve them and grow our business where we can, and support our customers so that they can grow coming out of this recession. Good morning, Ruplu. Thanks for the question. And I would say the trends are playing out, as we expected and as we shared with you. You remember last recession 2009, we talked through what we saw there. And it was a faster reaction by our small and medium sized businesses. In particular, they reacted more quickly to the economic downturn. And that is what we saw here. Now we have, as I mentioned, a diversified customer base even within small and corporate. And so, even within that, we saw some of the customers in certain industries, hospitality and things like that, who were suffering a little more, others who were actually being very aggressive in their strategies. The other thing is when you think about, as I mentioned, the uniqueness of what we're going through with the virus, and the fits and starts if you will, in different geographies, that's also tending to have an impact on our customers. But all of that said, I'd say that the trends played out as we expected. Look, small business channels are going to be impacted by economics, and they're going to focus on what they need to do to survive first and then invest for the future. So, what I'd say is it's really affirms our business diversification strategy, and provide optimism and the competence of our business model. If you think about what we were able to deliver, our free cash flow through the year is at $470 million. We've paid our dividend. We're continuing to invest in the evolution of CDW going forward. We've got other customer segments that are going very strong, given the demand in the market. And I'm really proud of how the team is managing through this. Thank you. Shannon, I would just add that our managed services capabilities are more robust now. And so, these conversations with customers in terms of service contracts and potentially shortening them have also led to some robust conversations about managed services and some wins for us in managed services as a result of those conversations. Yes. Shannon, on the education side K-12 in particular, they are accessing funding and we're helping them with that. So funds are flowing. And they are really all hands on deck, trying to get devices into the hands of students. And so, there's a lot of activity there regarding client devices, remote enablement as well as what we call kind of broadcasting from the school. It's very complicated and we had a highly seasoned sales organization that works with the schools. But the breadth of the solutions that we're looking for are fulsome as I mentioned in my remarks, all the way from thermal scanning and sanitation stations to dividers and carts and things that CDW can just help them provide, so that they have kind of turnkey solutions. But there is strong demand to get the kids in the classroom environment, whether virtual or hybrid as quickly as possible. So, there's a lot of pressure there and they are accessing funds. In higher ed, we're seeing some falls on the budget side. Obviously, they've got concerns around various revenue streams. And the solutions provided in the business there in terms of on campus robust network support, et cetera has been falling a little bit. But we are starting to see a pick up when it comes to remote enablement and devices and would expect that to continue as the school gets sorted out, coming into this September-October timeframe. In terms of the timing of funds flowing through, I don't have a particular timeframe that I would know how to share, But I would say, they're moving a little faster than I would have expected in some areas. And again, our teams are really excited, figuring out where they're going to flow, how they're going to flow and how to make sure you write up the order so that the funds can apply. But they are flowing, and I would expect the same would happen with any new build that we see that makes it true. Hi. Ted. Yes. On acquisition and new clients, we haven't really shared specific information about numbers of acquisition and penetration rate. But I would say that it has not been relatively harder, because we are remote. Because we've moved all of our marketing, for example, to digital channels. So, we're reaching more customers and we're reaching more people within customers, and taking the opportunity to follow-up. So, we've, retooled how we put together acquisition programs to be as effective as possible. Our sellers are really quite amazing in their ability to connect with people and develop relationships, virtually. And as I did mention, we do have sellers who are now more out in the field with customers as well. But I've been really pleased with how they've been able to transition and the aggressiveness or the assertiveness and the success with our acquisition programs right now. And the second question, Ted, was around retention. Yes, we don't -- that's not a number that we share. But I would say that the customer satisfaction in this current environment has been really quite high, what we measure from the satisfaction perspective. Hi, Matt. Yes, there are concerns. Certainly, we talked about that in the last call budget concerns. But again, we are finding that in the state and local area. Budgets are being prioritized against IT initiatives, both work from home and also that various projects, government e-projects that are in flight. The hope and expectation is we will see in a stimulus package some sort of relief for state and local governments. And again, we hope that governments figure out where to get that. But they are struggling a bit now, but continuing to spend on the IT needs that's been prioritized and essential for their workforce and for their mission. I do, Matt. Look, healthcare literally caused the global pandemic virus, and protected all of us and has been protecting all of us. But, they've been forced to see revenue generating businesses or at least diminish them. And I'm confident, given the demographic trends and changes that have already taken place regarding loosening regulations and accelerating digital transformation, that it will result in a strong recovery and long-term growth in the healthcare end market. And we are having extensive conversations with our healthcare systems around virtual care, across all spectrums. You've got telehealth and telemedicine, virtual rounding, you've got remote patient monitoring and then you've got enhanced patient monitoring in places like the ICU. And all of those require slightly different sorts of solutions. And we are building those out for some customers already. But I do see that as a long-term positive trend. Well, we just -- I'll start and Collin, you can jump in if you like. Yes, we just did an acquisition of IGNW, and that's made of cloud services provider. That's a great example of investing our capital behind our strategy of developing the solutions and services that our customers need now and in the future. So, we absolutely will continue to look at potential targets. And we're very active in inbounds, we're very active in outbound. And this organization IGNW like Aptris is a partner that CDW had worked with some time. So, we got to know them very well. We got to know the people and the quality and the culture and their capabilities. So, we will continue to look in the market for opportunistic acquisitions. Well, yes. Okay. Thank you. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the many continued challenges due to COVID-19, and to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices and contributions being made by so many who are devoting themselves to serving others. I also want to recognize the remarkable dedication of our co-workers around the globe, and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. They continuously impressed me, and reaffirm my conviction that we will emerge stronger from this. Thank you. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and the opportunity to serve you during these times. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter."

            "name": "Collin Kebo",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our second quarter results, liquidity position and capital allocation priorities. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 9, consolidated net sales were $4.4 billion down 5.7% on a reported and average daily sales basis. In constant currency, consolidated net sales declined by 5.3%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 0.5% versus the first quarter. As expected, this was lower than historical seasonality due to the first quarter stronger than normal seasonality, and the ongoing impact of COVID-19. As Chris mentioned, our customer channels generally perform consistent with the demand and writings commentary shared on our last earnings call. April sales benefited from the carryover of strong demand in March, whereas May and June sales were impacted by lower demand in certain customer end markets. Pockets of supply dislocation continued in the quarter. And we leveraged our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships to procure the IT products and solutions our customers needed, for remote enablement, operations continuity and resource optimization. Gross profit for the quarter was $747 million, a decline of 3.4%. Gross margin was 17.1%, up 40 basis points over last year, driven by product margin and by the mix of netted down revenues primarily software as a service. Turning to SG&A on Slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A decreased 1.5%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales payroll consistent with lower gross profit, reduced performance based compensation and cost savings measures including decreased travel and entertainment and ongoing productivity and efficiency efforts. The June 30, credit loss reserve balance decreased modestly versus the March 31, balance reflecting our customer collection experience in the quarter, a lower receivable balance at June quarter end and expectations for future collections. While we are generally pleased with second quarter's bad debt experience, we recognized that much economic uncertainty exists and remain cautious on year to go credit loss expectations. These expense reductions were partially offset by approximately $7 million of COVID-19 expenses, primarily to safeguard and compensate frontline co-workers. As we always do, we are closely monitoring our cost structure relative to the demand environment. Co-worker count at the end of the second quarter was 10,048, down 56 from the first quarter, reflecting restrictions on hiring and backfilling attrition that we put in place in April. Year-over-year co-worker count increased 265, with approximately 120 of the increase from the Atheros acquisition last fall, and the remaining from organic co-worker investments. Our recently completed acquisition of IGNW adds approximately 170 co-workers, most of whom are customer facing technical co-workers. GAAP operating income was $283 million down 5.6%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance was $338 million down 5.6%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%. Moving to Slide 11, interest expense was $40 million, down 1.8%. The incremental interest from the $600 million notes issued in April was offset by savings from a lower LIBOR rate on the term loan. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 12 was 22.9% in the quarter, compared to 24.7% last year. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $65 million last year. The rate decrease is primarily related to higher excess tax benefits and equity based compensation in 2020. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation, which is shown on Slide 13. For the quarter our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.9%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate. As you can see on Slide 14, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $144 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.31 down 1.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $225 million in the quarter, down 5.2% compared to last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.56 down 2.6% from last year. Turning to first-half results on Slides 15 through 20. Revenue was $8.8 billion, an increase of 1.9% on a reported basis and 1.1% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one extra selling day in the first-half of 2020. The extra selling day will reverse in Q4 when we have one fewer selling day compared to prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, first-half consolidated net sales were 1.5% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.5 billion up 4% and gross profit margin was 17.2% up 40 basis points. Non-GAAP operating income was $642 million for the first-half of 2020, down 0.5%. Net income was $357 million and non-GAAP net income was $425 million, up 0.5%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.94 up 3.4%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 21. Liquidity continues to be a top priority in the current environment. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $958 million and net debt was $2.9 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was roughly $2 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $468 million, as shown on Slide 22. This is higher than normal seasonality and above last year's $407 million, primarily due to tax payment timing. Last year, we made cash tax payments on April 15 and June 15. And this year, the comparable payments were made on July 15, after the end of the second quarter. Moving to Slide 23, the three month average cash conversion cycle is 25 days, up nine days from last year's second quarter. While cash collections were solid in the quarter, DSO increased seven days as we mix it into some larger public customers who can take longer to pay, and we have seen certain commercial customers extending payments. DIO increased four days, as we continue to invest in inventory to help our customers manage their IT projects with greater certainty of product availability. One of our greatest assets is our long-term customer relationships, and we know it's important to be there for customers during challenging times, like we were during the great recession. We will continue to balance managing customer's working capital needs, while appropriately managing risk. In the quarter, we returned $54 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and did not repurchase any stock. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 24, as I mentioned earlier, we remain focused on liquidity and our capital priorities remain the same as last quarter. Our priorities are, first, continue to pay the dividend. Today, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per common share, reflecting CDW's strong liquidity position in competence and the cash flow generation capability of the business. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We remained comfortable with the current target net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times for several reasons. One, we have no debt maturities in 2020 and just $57 million due in 2021. Two, the weighted average interest rate on the debt portfolio was 3.6%, so cash interest is manageable. And three, our debt capital structure is covenant like. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2 times below the low end of our target range. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of IGNW which closed after quarter end is a good example of this. IGNW is not expected to have a material impact on CDW's 2020 net sales and non-GAAP earnings per share. We remain actively evaluating targets and will seek to be opportunistic in this environment. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating in cultural fit and financial return, all within the context of liquidity at that point in time. Fourth, as I previously noted our share repurchase program remain suspended to enhance liquidity. The decision on when to resume stock buybacks continues to depend on several considerations, including the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and working capital, leverage and other potential uses of cash, such as M&A. Lastly on the topic of capital, we intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We have a CapEx like model, historically running around half a point of sales or slightly more. We believe it's important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity, and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. We previously withdrew our 2020 targets and will not be providing an updated financial outlook, but consistent with last quarter, I want to provide insights into what we're seeing roughly one month into the third quarter from a demand, supply and operating perspective. On the demand side, activity continues to be mixed across customer end markets. In corporate and small business, looking back to the second quarter for a moment, the year-over-year decline in writings peaked at over 20% in May or June depending on the channel. Consequently, preliminary July sales are down double-digits in both channels. July writings are down year-over-year with the declines less negative than the peak levels of May or June. While encouraging, as Chris mentioned, we believe it's premature to call this a trend as weekly writings have been volatile, and we expect commercial customers will be sensitive to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases and the potential economic implications. In public, preliminary July sales and July writings are up year-over-year, driven by continued strength in K-12 and parts of government, partially offset by healthcare where both preliminary sales and writings continue to be down. Our international businesses are generally seeing similar customer trends to last quarter. We expect to continue to mix into public channels, which could add some headwind to gross margin in the back-half of the year. On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a fluid environment with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. Notebook supply, particularly lower end devices such as Chromebooks is tight. We are also experiencing extended lead times in certain networking and server products. We are in constant contact with our vendor partners, whose manufacturing operations are generally back up and running. Free challenges have moderated, but we are still seeing some pricing surcharges and price increases on certain products, which we are generally passing along to customers. On the operating front, all distribution centers continue to be operational. Finally, I want to provide an update on the devices of service solution to the U.S. Census Bureau. The contribution to second quarter net sales was in line with expectations. We have now deployed all of the devices into the field. The period for which the devices will be used remains fluid, and we could see some net sales shift among the next three quarters. The team has done an outstanding job managing through a challenging environment to help the Census Bureau deliver its mission. From a financial perspective, this year, we now expect the Census to contribute up to approximately 160 basis points of incremental net sales growth over 2019. On an absolute basis, we currently expect the Census to contribute over 200 basis points of net sales in 2020. We will continue to provide updates on the Census as we progress through the second-half of 2020. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Jake to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you. Yes. Adam, there were -- if I understand your question, I think it was, why wasn't there more deleverage? There were a couple things that helped us in the quarter that I touched on in my prepared remarks. One was on the credit loss reserve. We ended up not booking any bad debt expense in the quarter. We just drew down against the reserve that we had previously established, and in fact, released a little bit of it just because of receivables balance had wound down. The second thing that happened in the quarter is we did true-up our performance based compensation accruals, based on full year estimates, and we took a half a year's benefit in the second quarter. So, I wouldn't expect those two things to continue as we move through the balance of the year. Sure. Amit, I can start on that one. Product margin held up pretty well, and we did get some benefit from mixing into software as a service. On the product margin within there, I would say in a supply constrained environment in particular categories, the margins can be a little bit firmer. And then within products, there's mix. So, for example, desktops happened to be weak in the quarter, they tend to be lower margin. So, within that product, we did see some lower margin. I think in terms of the outlook, as always difficult to predict because there are a lot of moving factors. I did say in my prepared comments that I do think that we will mix more into public as we move into the back-half of the year. Q3 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for both government and education. And given what's happening in education today, I would expect it to be quite strong. And then, where we do see a little bit more firmness on the commercial side of the business tends to be in the larger, better capitalized customers, which tend to have a little thinner margin. So, we were pleased with margin performance in the quarter, just cautious as we think about it over the back-half of the year. Yes, the only thing I was going to add is, and I think you know this. When you look at industry data points, you just need to make sure you're comparing apples to apples at what point in the supply chain you're measuring. So, I think some of those industry sources are OEM shipments into the channel and distributors and retailers and others like that. So, there's a little bit of the lag in that. Obviously, we saw very strong growth in client devices in the first quarter and in April as we shift against our backlog. So some of these shipments you're seeing are effectively replenishing lower levels of inventory further downstream in the supply chain that had been pretty well depleted. Just to clarify, I think what I was trying to do in my comments was particularly the commercial side of the business in corporate and small business give an indication of the peak decline we saw in the second quarter. So in May or June, those writings declined over 20% in both corporate and small business. What we're seeing in the month of July is that they are not as negative as those peak declines we saw earlier. So, it's a relative to what we had been seeing in the business statement. Yes. I mean, we're not going to provide a specific guide on SG&A. As you know, we do have a variable cost structure. So there are elements of it, variable sales compensation that will move with our gross profit. And then we have put hiring restrictions in place and continue to let attrition run, so that'll add a little bit of variability. And then we've taken other cost savings measures. And the other point I would make Ruplu is, we are not managing to a short-term SG&A target here, as I think we've been communicating pretty consistently. We do think that this is an opportunity to invest and get stronger in this. And so, we're going to take a balanced approach and that we are going to continue to invest both in CapEx and OpEx. But having said all that, we are mindful of the demand environment, and we'll take a balanced approach and ensure we have an appropriate cost structure. Thank you. Yes. We are seeing customers, particularly those who are looking to save cash move into shorter duration maintenance contracts, as opposed to going to multi-years, those that are paying on for software a number of seats and things like that, looking at true-ups and things like that. It's difficult to compare to previous times, Shannon. I think back in 2009, we saw a similar behavior and then when we experienced a bit of a slowdown in the '15 '16 period, we saw customer sweating assets at that point in time. Maybe a little bit more pronounced today than it was back in '15 '16, but I think that's logical just given the severity of the crisis relative to the slowdown we saw back then. Yes. Ted, I would just add, I mean, it's difficult in this environment, particularly for the most challenged customers who are looking to preserve liquidity, they're pulling back. So, they may not be spending period versus not spending with CDW. I think in an environment like this, consistent with our remarks, we are staying in front of our customers, even those that may not be spending. And I think if there's wallet to be had, we're getting our fair share of that. Yes. When you say the note, you mean the notes we issued in April, those were for general corporate purposes to enhance our liquidity as well as to make sure we have sufficient working capital to support our customers. I would say one act area that we're very active in is working with our customers and helping them understand the variety of vendor partner financing programs that are out there. And that's where we start and many of our OEMs have been quite aggressive in terms of providing attractive financing, and we are seeing a pretty material uptake on that from our customers. So, the nice thing about that is, it doesn't flow through our financials. As I mentioned, there are some instances though, where we are investing in inventory for customers, or have seen terms pick up a bit and that's where you would see it in our working capital. Yes. In terms of prioritization, liquidity is our top priority, but we have $2 billion of it. So, we feel really good about where we are. The dividend is a priority. We just declared that. And again, given the cash flow generation capability of the business, feel good about that. We're below our target leverage, sitting at 2 times. So our next priority is M&A. And so, if we find the right opportunity at the right price, we'll take the opportunity to enhance our competitive position in this environment. I mean, we're not going to -- in normal times, we wouldn't guide by channel, and certainly in the current environment, we're not going to. I think you can tell from our comments on the second quarter and writings and comments about where we think the mid-business is going to mix into the second-half of the year, that the demand is more resilient on the public side, particularly federal government education. You did call out Chromebooks. We are keeping an eye on that. Supply is tight there, given the extraordinary demand. And that's a little bit of a wild card that we've see in the third or fourth quarter. But given the breadth of our vendor partners and our scale, we think we'll be able to manage that as well as anyone. Not that there may not be disruption, but in terms of customers looking for supply, we think CDW can help them given our multi vendors. We're also having conversations with customers around alternative processors and things like that. So we're doing what we can to get creative, to get supply for our customers to help them through the Chromebook shortage. Yes, I mean, in terms of writings, I think the commentary we provided on writings for small business gives you a good overview of the demand environment. Obviously, within that you have industries that are relatively stronger, and those are a little bit more challenged. And even within industries, you have some winners and losers. On the cash collections front, I would say we were generally pleased with the pace of cash collections from our commercial customers, including our small business customers. We do have a long tail of small customers that we're keeping an eye on that portion of the credit portfolio. But, overall, I would say the collections held up reasonably well in the quarter. Yes. In terms of working capital, I think one of the dynamics you would expect to see is when the business shrinks that we would liquidate some working capital, and you did see that dynamic play out in the quarter. That was partially offset though, by seeing the cash conversion cycle tick up a bit. I think the other thing to keep in mind as you think about free cash flow, we did get some timing favorability in terms of cash taxes. We didn't make a payment in the second quarter and historically, it's one of our biggest quarterly payments, and that reversed a little bit. In terms of CapEx, you're right, it is a little bit heavier, front end loaded this year. You might recall that some of the Census devices that we procure for our device as a service offering or running through CapEx. With all of those devices out in the field, now we are virtually done with additional capital expenditures for the Census. So, those are some things to think about and the puts and takes of free cash flow and working capital. Thank you."

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you, Brittany. I first want to take a moment to share our respect from CDW to all who are suffering hardships or loss as we face this COVID-19 health crisis, and also to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices and contributions being made by so many who are devoting themselves to serving others. I\u2019ll begin this morning with a high level overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance. I\u2019ll also discuss how we are addressing the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our co-workers, customers and operations and share some thoughts on the balance of 2020. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We\u2019ll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for Q&A. We had a very strong first quarter. Net sales were $4.4 billion, 9.2% above last year on average daily sales basis, adjusted for the impact of one more business day in the first quarter of 2020 than 2019, and up 9.4% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $304 million, an increase of 5.8%. This includes a $29 million increase in our credit loss reserve to reflect the macroeconomic environment due to COVID-19. Non GAAP net income per share was $1.38, up 11% on a reported basis, and up 11.3% in constant currency. As the quarter progressed in March, we served a meaningful increase in customer demand. CDW teams orchestrated solutions for client\u2019s devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security and others from our broad portfolio to address our customer\u2019s remote work in business continuity needs. We experienced solid results across the US business with all five US channels growing high single-digits and solid local performance from our international teams. This growth came from both existing and new customers. To address anticipated supply constraints we leveraged our scale, distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, strong vendor partner relationships and healthy balance sheet and liquidity position, fulfilling our customers and prospects urgent and critical IT needs. We procured the supply in key categories early and managed through longer industry lead times for our customers in a supply-constrained environment. Our net sales performance for the quarter was balanced with 9% growth for both US hardware and software and 26% services growth. In March, customer priorities quickly redirected to remote workforce enablement and work continuity, driving strong transactional performance of almost 20%. During this time, customers de-prioritized infrastructure and less urgent service projects, resulting in a low single digit year-over-year decline for solutions. Cloud customers spend and gross profit increased double-digits drive by strong growth in collaboration, security and productivity, workloads consistent with remote workforce enablement. We generated strong double-digit growth in product categories that enabled work from home and operations continuity plan, including client devices both notebook and desktops, video, collaboration tools, configuration services and security. Our teams orchestrated a seamless combination of these products and services plus others from our broader portfolio to provide full solutions to our customers. Clearly the team delivered strong performance. I am proud of and grateful to our co-workers who persevered for our customers. Now, looking more closely at our customer end-markets performance, our corporate and Small Business teams both delivered over 8% growth, driven by double-digit growth in transactional categories as the team successfully developed work from home capabilities for our customers. The Government team increased sales almost 15%, Federal had another excellent quarter with sales up double-digits primarily driven by the census project. The state and local team also delivered double-digit growth driven by strong transactional and solutions performance that enabled remote work capability and crisis readiness efforts. Education increased 17% with strong double-digit growth in both higher ed and K-12. Customers in both markets were focused on enabling remote learning capabilities.  Our healthcare team delivered 7% growth primarily driven by transactional product categories to adapt to the new care delivery environment. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations increased 3% on a reported basis. UK was up low constant currency. That was on top of four years of first quarter double-digit growth. The UK team has been instrumental in helping with the government\u2019s response to COVID-19, providing crucial technology to the new critical care field hospitals as well as enabling remote work capabilities for our customers. Canada increased double-digits, also driven by remote work enablement and strong demand from healthcare and education customers. Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, our full suite of solutions and services that can address even rapidly shifting customer priorities across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. I want to take a minute to review each of these for two reasons. First, because these are important drivers of CDW\u2019s first quarter performance and second they provide frame work to think about CDW\u2019s performance under various macroeconomic condition. As you know we have five US sales channels, that each generated annual net sales of 1.5 billion in 2019. Corporate, small business, government, education, this scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end-markets, including Federal Government, State and Local Government, K-12 and higher education. Providing us insights into our customers\u2019 objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered over US$2 billion of net sales in 2019. The diversity of our customer end-markets serve us as well with macro or other external challenges impact various industries and business differently. This is especially relevant in the current environment. Next, the breadth of our offerings, with over 100,000 products, services and solutions for more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well-positioned to meet our customers\u2019 total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends and customer demand. And, finally, our three-part strategy for growth, which is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share, second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and, third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Before I turn to our thoughts about the balance of the year, I want to provide insights into our managing COVID-19 impact on our business. To holistically manage our response in mid-February, we activated a cross-functional response team led by executive committee members. The team leveraged our pre-established crisis management protocols to ensure we responded as quickly as possible. The team has three key principles, safe guard the health and well-being of our co-workers, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers and partners, and support ours communities. One of the key actions, we took to maintain the impact of the virus on our customers, on our co-workers and our operations was to implement a global work-from-home order from office co-workers in mid-March. We have excellent IT infrastructure and support so the transition to work from home was shift and seamless. We are monitoring developments closely, developing plans accordingly, and we will be prepared for our return to office at the appropriate time. We are focused on our co-workers\u2019 safety and well-being in the workplace. To do this at our three distribution and configuration centers, we are operating under precautionary measures advised by public health authorities, including social distancing, segment and shift, personnel protective equipment, enhanced facilities cleaning and temperature screening for anyone entering the facilities. Currently, all distribution and configuration centers are fully operational. At the end of March to limit the virus spread after a few co-workers tested positive for COVID-19, we decide to close our Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center for several days and to require a shift to configuration center co-workers to self-isolate. These actions did not have a material impact as the team\u2019s leveraged flexibility in our distribution and capabilities where possible. Our distribution center in Las Vegas fulfilled customer orders and orders were drop shifted directly to customers, and where not shipping times modestly increased. I regard our exceptional co-workers and our unique culture to be a meaningful competitive advantage. Our team has responded to the current environment in exemplary ways. One example is our internal dig marketplace created to match areas of our business where demand has spiked, with internal talent on temporary assignment. Another example is the reallocating of our sales and technical resources to where the growth is and will be going, which we successfully did during the great recession. We will again be nimble by identifying and implementing ways to optimally utilize our highly skilled co-workers. In addition and consistent with our strong culture of giving CDW has and continues to contribute meaningfully to support the COVID-19 response efforts locally in the US, UK and Canada. Now let me turn to our 2020 financial performance. As a result of COVID-19 and the unknown duration and depth of its impact, we withdrew our 2020 targets on April 16, as most all companies are doing. The near term impact of COVID-19 on some customers we serve could be meaningful, with some ed markets impacted more significantly than others. Consistent with prior experience where commercial customers have reacted relatively quickly to economic conditions, we anticipate the demand will be lower for some of our small business and corporate customers. We expect demand from our public customers to be relatively firmer, led by resiliency in our federal channel, due to the Census project and the IT priorities we support, including infrastructure upgrades and security enhancements to remain top priorities. Demand will likely be next for our other public channels, with budget uncertainty for healthcare, state and local and education customers. We continue to track stimulus support and, where possible, help our customers navigate the various programs. Regarding product categories, we expect customers to prioritize mission-critical IT spending and for some to push out longer term solutions projects, including infrastructure projects and service engagement. In recent weeks, our focus has shifted to helping our customers manage their work from home environments at scale. Solutions that \u2013 solution for that includes security, network augmentation to accommodate new demand, remote performance management, virtual desktops and effective application management. Longer term, we expect our customers and prospective customers to design and implement technology driven strategies to not just survive, but to thrive. We expect to see an acceleration in digital transformation, cloud migration and automation strategies, as companies invest to successfully compete in the future. We believe that technology will be as or more essential to all sectors of our economy, and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We intend to continue to help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape. During our 35 year history, CDW has a successful track record of evolving with customer needs in the ever-evolving IT industry. We are committed to continuing to invest in our three-part strategy, including capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity and enhance our competitive position. As we do so, we will keep a watchful eye on the impact of COVID-19, the macro environment, and other unpredictable variables, such as potential supply disruptions, trade policies and the upcoming US election. CDW will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objective. And out-execute our competition. While this is a particularly uncertain and challenging time for all, I\u2019m confident that CDW will continue to grow to new heights. Now Collin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin?\nCollin Kebo: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to provide more detail on our first quarter results and capital allocation priorities in the current environment. Turning to our first quarter P&L on slide nine, consolidated net sales were $4.4 billion, up 10.9% on a reported basis, and 9.2% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one additional selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 9.4%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 4.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. This was better than expected and historical seasonality. As the quarter progressed and we moved into March, the impact of COVID-19 led to a meaningful increase in customer demand for client devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security and other solutions to keep other solutions to keep customers\u2019 operations running. While there were pockets of supply dislocation, as Chris mentioned, we leveraged our scale and distribution capabilities to help customers get access to the IT they needed for business continuity. Some portion of the record monthly sales we achieved in March is likely attributable to a pull forward of future demand, but it\u2019s difficult to quantify at quantify at this point. Gross profit for the quarter was $757 million, an increase of 12.6%. Gross margin was 17.2%, up 20 basis points over last year, driven by product margin and services, partially offset by netted down revenue streams not growing as fast as net sales. Turning to our SG&A on slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A increased 17.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $29 million increase in our credit loss reserve to reflect the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of COVID-19. SG&A also reflects higher payroll costs consistent with higher co-worker count and higher gross profit as well as roughly $2 million of incremental COVID-19 expenses, primarily to safeguard our co-workers. Co-worker count of 10,104 was up 670 co-workers from March 2019, with approximately 100 of the year-over-year increase from the Atheros acquisition and the remaining from organic co-worker investments. Roughly 60% of the 670 co-workers added year-over-year are in customer-facing roles. As you know, we have a variable cost structure, given that sales commissions are paid on a percentage of gross profit and growth in co-worker count is one of our biggest investments. We have implemented hiring restrictions and are letting attrition run for a while as we closely monitor the macroeconomic and demand environments. GAAP operating income was $246 million, up 7.4%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $304 million, an increase of 5.8%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 6.9%. Moving to slide 11, interest expense was $38 million for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on slide 12, was 20.7% in the quarter, up 50 basis points compared to last year. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $44 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation, which is shown on slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 10 basis points versus last year\u2019s rate. As you can see on slide 14, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share $1.16, up 13.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $200 million in the quarter, up 7.9% over last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.38, up 11% from last year. The increase in the credit loss reserve equates to approximately $0.15 per share. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 15, liquidity is a clear priority in the current environment. As of March 31st, cash and cash equivalents were $214 million and net debt was $3.3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we bolstered our liquidity position by issuing $600 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 4.8% for general corporate purposes. Additional measures to enhance liquidity includes suspending share repurchases and implementing various cost savings initiatives. Free cash flow for the quarter was $116 million, as shown on slide 16. This is lower than normal seasonality and below last year\u2019s $303 million for several reasons. One, because sales growth was back-end loaded in the quarter, the receivables associated with those sales are sitting on the March 31 balance sheet. Two, we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. And three, we leveraged our scale and distribution centers to increase investment in inventory to better support customers in a supply-constrained environment. Moving to slide 17. The three month average cash conversion cycle was 20 days, up 3 days from last year\u2019s first quarter. The balance sheet dynamics I just described are somewhat moderated when you look at three month average working capital metrics because of how sales phasing played out in the quarter. Looking ahead, our working capital metrics could be impacted as we strategically invest in inventory or due to pressure on receivable collections as customers are impacted by the macroeconomic environment. One of our greatest assets is our long-term customer relationships, and we know it\u2019s important to be there for customers during challenging times like we were during the Great Recession. We will continue to balance managing customer\u2019s working capital needs, while appropriately managing risk. For the quarter, we deployed a $195 million of cash to shareholders, which included $54 million of dividend and $141 million of share repurchase at an average price of approximately $123 per share. Turning to capital allocation on slide 18. As I mentioned earlier we are focused on liquidity and have reassessed other uses of capital within that context. Our priorities are, first, continue to pay the dividend. Today, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per common share, reflecting CDW\u2019s strong liquidity position and confidence in the cash flow generation capability of the business. We expect to evaluate any changes in the dividend in the fourth quarter of this year consistent with historical timing. Future dividends will be subject to board approval. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We remain comfortable with the current target net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times for several reasons. One, we have no debt maturities in 2020 and just $57 million, due in 2022. Two, the weighted average interest rate on the debt portfolio was 3.9% pro forma for the $600 million notes issued in April. So cash interest is manageable. And three, our debt capital structure was covenant light. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.2 times slightly below the low end of our target range and flat to year end 2019. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions, a challenging economic environment could present attractive M&A opportunities. So we remain active in evaluating targets. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating and cultural fit and financial return all within the context of liquidity at that point in time. Fourth, as I noted previously, we suspended our share repurchase program to enhance liquidity with first quarter buybacks of 1.1 million shares. We have already offset expected dilution associated with stock compensation for this year. The decision on when to resume stock buybacks will depend on several considerations, including the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and working capital, leverage and other potential uses of cash, such as M&A. Lastly, on the topic of capital. We intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We have a CapEx light model, historically, running around 0.5 point of sales or slightly more. We believe it\u2019s important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that will allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. While we have withdrawn 2020 targets, and will not be providing an updated financial outlook, I do want to provide insights into what we\u2019re seeing roughly five weeks into the quarter. On the demand side, customer activity has been mixed. We entered April with a healthy backlog of remote workforce enablement solutions, which contributed to solid shipment growth in April. However, writings and corporate and small business were down double digits year-over-year, which will weigh on shipments going forward. This is consistent with past experience, where we\u2019ve seen commercial customers react sooner to macroeconomic conditions. On the other hand, public sector writings were up year-over-year, reflecting strength in government and K-12 and more muted demand in higher education and health care. Our international businesses are generally seeing similar trends with their customers. You may recall that both the UK and Canada have a lower mix of sales to public sector customers than the US. On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a fluid environment with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. We are in constant contact with our vendor partners whose manufacturing operations are generally back up and running. Freight is a challenge, resulting in pricing surcharges and price increases on certain products. On the operating front, both distribution centers in the US continue to be fully operational since the brief closure of our Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center at the end of March. Finally, I want to provide an update on the device as a service solution to the US Census Bureau. The contribution to first quarter sales was generally in line with expectations. In March, the Census Bureau temporarily suspended field data collection activities and steps are being taken to reactivate field offices next month. In April, the Census Bureau announced it was seeking statutory relief from Congress for an additional 120 days, which would extend the window for field data collection and self-response to October 31. The delay is expected to shift a modest amount of net sales from to Q4 from Q2. Finally, we are working with the Census Bureau to help meet the customers\u2019 objective of making up lost time due to COVID-19. CDW expects to provide additional devices, enabling the Census to have more workers in the field. As a result of these changes, we now expect the Census project to contribute up to approximately 140 basis of incremental sales growth in 2020. The rollout schedule is fluid, so we could see revenue shift from 2020 into 2021. We will continue to provide updates on the Census as we progress through 2020. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I\u2019ll ask Olivia to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one, with a brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe to start off with Collin or Chris, I was just hoping you could spend a few minutes maybe just comparing how CDW performed through the \u201808, \u201809 recession and what are sort of the puts and takes when one compares SARS to what\u2019s going on right now. Maybe you can kind of frame that up that would be really helpful. And then, just - I\u2019ll ask my second question as well upfront. How does the share gain narrow to work for CDW in an environment like this? Is it easier? Are customers more willing to engage with new vendors? Or is that something that happens in our post-COVID post-recession world? Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Okay. Hi Amit, good morning, it\u2019s Chris, and I\u2019ll start, and then Collin can add in. When we think back to the 2009 recession, first of all, I would say, as we all know, two downturns are the same. And with respect to where we sit today, we can\u2019t tell with any level of certainty what\u2019s going to happen. This is that essence, the health crisis and the economic issues are derivative. But if we look back to 2008 and \u201809, it can be informative. So, if we look at the segments, corporate and small business, they did tend to react more quickly, as Collin suggested in his script to the downturn. And if you look at our investor deck, you can see that corporate was down 22% and small business declined small business declined 18%, so significantly. The public sector channels, as we\u2019ve mentioned, were more resilient, and we saw growth in government and education. Health care was a little flat. But I would think about coming out of the recession, we saw corporate, small business and health care grow quite nicely. And if you think about similarities, the business model that we have, the resiliency of that business model, our ability to stick with our customers and to offer them a wide slot of products, particularly coming out of the recession, remains strong. As I think about today, we are in a stronger financial position than we were in 2008 and \u201809. And I remember, Amit, meeting interest obligations in \u201809, when we were at 10 times debt leverage, which was our peak. Today, we have, obviously, a strong balance sheet. And we have more opportunistic outlook. I would also say that, technology today has become much more essential to our customers\u2019 strategy, hard stop. There\u2019s been increasing complexity. The breadth of our portfolio, what we sell, our evolution, has grown. And so today, we\u2019re better positioned than ever to help our customers through this downturn. But the lack of visibility that we all have still makes it difficult to predict with any level of certainty. Collin?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah, Chris. I don\u2019t know that I have much more to add to that. That was a pretty thorough review. I mean, as you think about, the various channels, as we\u2019ve said corporate small business reacted sooner. GDP bottomed, I think, in the fourth quarter of 2008 and then improved sequentially. It was still down a bit year-over-year over the next couple of quarters. We saw corporate and small business react very swiftly in the first quarter of \u201809. So that first quarter declined more than the full year. And then, the rates of decline improved as we move throughout the year. But as Chris said, look, every recession like this is different, so not much more to add other than that.\nChristine Leahy: Yeah. Amit, I\u2019d add one more thing. And I\u2019ll come back to your second question is when you think about the complexion of our resources. And remember, we\u2019ve got over 3,000 technologists today. And we\u2019re really very well positioned to support customers and where they\u2019re heading. As we think about what might accelerate coming out of this current situation, we\u2019ve got physical distance. Digital is now mandatory. It\u2019s a prerequisite for market survival, frankly. And we\u2019re very well positioned to help our customers with that. But on your second question on taking market share, we did acquire a healthy dose of new customers. We had product to offer them. And we could get it to them quickly. So we feel confident that we were able to take share in this environment.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you very much for the answers. Appreciate it.\nChristine Leahy: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMatt Cabral: Yeah. Thank you very much. Just given the magnitude of uncertainty that\u2019s out there right now, can you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about managing the expense base versus the desire to maintain investment? And just how we should think about the flexibility of SG&A this time around compared to prior downturns?\nChristine Leahy: Matt, it\u2019s Chris, and I\u2019ll start, and then Collin, you can add in. Listen, you know we have a naturally variable cost structure. And just as it did in 2008 and \u201809, we benefit from that as we go through downturns like this. I would say that we\u2019ve been proactive and prudent. We consider to manage our business prudently, part of what we need to do every day. But the team has been at this in a very granular level on a daily basis, watching a couple of things. Obviously, demand we\u2019re very focused on sales trends by channel, gross profit that we\u2019re seeing in NGLI and we\u2019re managing that and looking at that more closely than we ever had. Obviously from a liquidity position, Collins and his team have been very granular around our cash collections and other things that impact our liquidity. So I would say, number one, we\u2019ve been very proactive and very detail oriented and making changes and moves quickly, as opposed to waiting. As Collin mentioned in his prepared remarks, I think we\u2019ve already done things like change events and other expenses that we can do. We do have a performance excellence team and we\u2019ve talked about this before, it\u2019s called reinvent to reinvest and they have - they\u2019ve actually contributed meaningfully over the past few years to our results. And they are laser focused on our operating model and ensuring that we are being as efficient and effective as we possibly can. So as we go through this frankly, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re managing the business, but we aren\u2019t being shy about, really finding places to improve from an operational perspective of the business, so that we can continue to invest as we move forward. And some of that might be not moving some resources, we\u2019re working on that. We\u2019ve got resources that actually can flex across the business. That\u2019s part of the beauty of the types of sellers and technical folks that we have in terms of their experience and their capabilities and our training programs, which are such an engine for us. So we\u2019re also moving resources on the right opportunities. Collin?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. I guess I would just add, again, Matt, we have a variable cost structure. Sales compensation, pay down gross profit is our biggest expense. And our biggest investment is in people cost and so letting attrition run add some variability to the cost structure. Obviously, we\u2019ve taken a look at other parts of the cost structure, travel, events and things like that that don\u2019t make sense in this environment. As Chris mentioned, ongoing productivity and efficiency is a part of the culture, and we\u2019ve dialed that up. And we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in managing costs, and we\u2019ll make adjustments based on market conditions and the demand \u2013 the demand environment as we go down the road here. But we are going to prudently invest in the business, so that we do emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position.\nMatt Cabral: Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, you talked about supply constraints a few times. Can you just talk about what availability of product looks like across your business right now? And going forward, just how you\u2019re thinking about managing inventory given the lack of visibility versus the potential for any future disruption of the supply chain?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah, sure. I would say, I think we used the word fluid or dynamic. It\u2019s choppy out there. We are running heavy on inventory just because we felt it made sense to carry additional days of safety stock. We provide pre-orders to some of our customers, and they get a lot of benefit out of that. So we\u2019re doing that to try to mitigate some of the choppiness in the market. I would say, unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a lot of demand for notebooks. So that\u2019s where we have taken some of our inventory positions, as well as within the Chromebook market, obviously, given the strain that this has placed on our education systems. And then I would say we\u2019ve seen lead times pick up in some other categories on the solutions side of the business in servers. It\u2019s not, I would say, disruptive per se, but just extended lead times. And then I did comment a little bit about where we have seen some price increases, and that\u2019s primarily due to just increased freight costs that our OEM vendor partners are incurring and the passing along of some of those costs. So we have seen some price increases in client devices as well as within servers.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks and good morning. Chris, I just wanted to start with some questions around the structural changes to the structural changes to the competitive landscape. Obviously, there\u2019s a number of clients out there in the industry that are hurting and you\u2019re in a position to issue $600 million of debt at attractive financing terms to help those clients. But industry landscape is very fragmented, there is many small players that won\u2019t have visibility. So maybe if you could just touch on how you see the competitive landscape changing as this unfolds? What structural changes are you thinking about?\nChristine Leahy: Yeah. Matt, I want to make sure I understand your question. You\u2019re talking about customers; you\u2019re talking about others within the channel that are competitors for CDW?\nAdam Tindle: Other competitors in the channel to CDW and whether that leads to basically more industry consolidation over time as time as you potentially gain share through this?\nChristine Leahy: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think, look, when there is a downturn of any kind that is severe, it exposes weaknesses across any industry. And not like - not unlike other industries, I think we will see that certainly in our industry. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ll continue to keep our eye on opportunistic M&A. And I wouldn\u2019t say that we would - you\u2019ve heard me say this before, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re focused on a roll up, but we certainly are focused on M&A that fits our various lenses that you know well. It\u2019s strategic fit, operational fit, cultural fit, makes financial sense. We haven\u2019t turned that lens off, and we will continue to look.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And just as a follow-up, Collin, on the $65 million debt offering, part of that, you talked about helping our clients. Just, if you could double-click on what you mean by that? It would seem to be a bridge to help maybe on payment terms. So why not tap the revolver for that? And also the systems and processes you\u2019re putting in place to control risk as you do so? Thanks.\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Adam. I think in terms of the $600 million, just in this kind of environment, given the uncertainty and with the wide range of outcomes out there and very difficult to probability assess where those outcomes are going to be, we just felt it was prudent to go and get excess liquidity. And I think most companies in corporate America that have the ability to do so, went ahead and did that we were able to get it at an attractive rate at four and an eight. So, we viewed it as relatively inexpensive insurance in case you know these outcomes, go to a more bearish place, but in the event we don\u2019t need the insurance. It\u2019s relatively cheap capital that we can deploy offensively. In terms of what we would do with that, we are mindful of the pressure that that\u2019s out there for customers, so I think in terms of investing in working capital. I talked a fair amount about potentially using some of that within inventory and to help smooth out some of the disruption, that\u2019s out there and that would competitively advantage CDW as well as help our customers get access to the IT they need sooner rather than later. From a receivables perspective, obviously our customers are under pressure and they\u2019re managing their own liquidity circumstances and looking at their cost structures and things like that. One of the things that CDW does is we orchestrate financing solutions for our customers, so obviously our OEM vendor partners and others make financing available and so we\u2019ve been very active in making those solutions available to our customers and that obviously helps both the customer, but also helps us manage our DSO risk. There are certain situations where customers are under pressure and we\u2019ll deal with those on a case-by-case basis. In terms of how we\u2019re managing risk, we did a pretty thorough review of the portfolio in terms of credit limits and where we had exposures to various industries and customers and adjusted credit risk appropriately. Again managing or balancing some of these long standing customer relationships we have, while still protecting the balance sheet and ensuring we had an appropriate risk profile in place. And obviously again like every other company in corporate America we are very closely monitoring our daily cash collections and understanding where risks might be emerging in the portfolio and then adjusting credit limits accordingly.\nAdam Tindle: Very helpful. Thanks, Collin.\nCollin Kebo: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. For the first question, I\u2019d like to ask, how many of your co-workers are currently still working from home. And how did that impact your ability to close deals in the first quarter? Or maybe if you can just help us quantify the impact of COVID-19 on both the top line and the operating profit line in calendar 1Q? Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yeah, good morning. It\u2019s Chris on the co-workers, we have a north of 80% of our co-workers are now work from home, and the others are in our distribution centers configuration centers and onsite engineers and a few security folks are also on site, so it\u2019s a fairly large portion of our workforce. And, I\u2019ll give kudos to our technology teams and all of those individuals because the move to work from home was swift and seamless. Our IT infrastructure was ready to go. And it was almost eerie how few hiccups we had on that Monday morning. My view on their productivity is it\u2019s been incredibly strong and in many ways, you might have heard this from other companies. This is driving even higher levels of productivity in some areas and greater connection between our own workforce and with our customers, it\u2019s been really quite interesting to see. In terms of dimensionalizing impact from COVID-19 on the numbers, I just think that\u2019s almost impossible to do. As we mentioned, we know we saw the surge in March because of work-from-home and remote work needs. And now there were some pull forward redirection of investment into that first quarter. But to quantify it just seems impossible to do.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that, Chris. And just as a quick follow-up. As we stand, as we sit here today, can you comment on the business mix you\u2019re seeing between client devices and netted down items? And how do you see that impacting margins? Thanks.\nCollin Kebo: Yes, I mean as we commented in the prepared remarks, Ruplu, client devices, very strong in the quarter and particularly as we exited the quarter. And also in my prepared comments, I talked about how we had a pretty healthy backlog then that we carried into April that contributed to solid shipment growth. You can assume that a lot of that was in the client device category. In terms of 100% gross margin items, they did not grow as fast as the rest of the business in the first quarter. I think that was largely driven by the focus on client devices and video and accessories and all the other things that you would need to enable, work-from-home and learn from home and things like that. I think it remains to be seen what\u2019s going to happen as we go forward in terms of how some of those 100% gross margin items perform. It\u2019s logical that those things are cloud, we\u2019d see strong growth on a go forward basis in previous environments, when things have slowed down, we have seen customers sweat assets. And you can see warranties and software assurance and things like that pick up as well. But I think we\u2019ll need to see what happens over the next few quarters here before I\u2019d want to make a more definitive call on what happens with that portion of that business.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.\nCollin Kebo: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you and good morning. A clarification question. First, when you referenced the double-digit declines in late March and April for the corporate sector, was that a revenue comment or that was new bookings that won\u2019t impact the reported results for several months? And then one of the clearest trends, and you talked about this in your prepared remarks is an acceleration adoption of public cloud. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re doing to enable the sales force or expand the portfolio of services to capture more value from that shift? Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Katy, I\u2019ll take the first one and maybe Chris will take the second. Just to clarify my comments. When I was talking about what we were seeing, those were comments really for the first five weeks of the second quarter, so primarily April. And when I said shipments, we saw solid growth as a result of the backlog. You can think of that as equivalent to revenue. When we talk about writings or bookings, and that\u2019s what I referred to as being down double-digits in corporate and small business, those at some point turn into future shipments or invoices. So that\u2019s more of a leading indicator. Hopefully, that clarifies it for it.\nKaty Huberty: That\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s what I figured. I wanted to make sure.\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. Okay. And then I think\u2026\nChristine Leahy: Yeah. I\u2019ll take your question, Katy. Good morning. On cloud, as you know, we\u2019ve been building our capabilities around cloud and the hybrid multi-cloud work environment now for years. And when we think about cloud generally, I think about it adding even more complexity to the choices that our customers need to make and you add the uncertainty of the world that we\u2019re in today, there\u2019s even another layer of complexity. Even simple cloud choices like the video and call solutions that we all are using now creates complexity for the IT staff as they\u2019ve got to enable co-workers to use it consistently, and at high-performance levels, et cetera. So this plays very well into our value proposition. We have, as you know, I think, we have over 250 cloud offerings on our line card, and we\u2019re essentially \u2013 our value prop is we\u2019re vendor and technology and consumption and consumption agnostic. So we can play that trusted adviser role for organizations as they\u2019re sorting through what their strategies ought to be. And frankly, when we talk to customers now, the questions, because they\u2019re moving so quickly, is help us figure this out, what should we do, how should we do it? We\u2019re having those types of questions around assessing and design more frequently than ever before. So you think about professional services, managed services for public and hybrid cloud. Those are areas that we have been investing and we\u2019ll continue to invest in. So we can help our customers assess their options, where to migrate and how to evaluate how to integrate, how to support the deployment and then how to manage cloud workloads. So I would say, it\u2019s a full spectrum from a CES design, integrate and manage across a multi-cloud world.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Operator Our next question coming from the line of the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMaggie Nolan: Hi. You\u2019ve talked about kind of reallocating sales and technical resources and maybe this builds on that previous question a little bit. But obviously, some of that has probably been done to meet the surge in demand in March and into April that you saw. But can you take a little bit more of a bit more of a medium-term outlook on that? Where are the strategic changes coming into play as we think about the coming quarters and the rest of the year?\nChristine Leahy: Yeah, Hi, Maggie. So in connection with the resources, yeah, think about it a couple of different ways. One is you think \u2013 I think about our sales organization and where demand is and how we can help generate demand and also help customers facilitate through stimulus packages and things like that. So some of the more resilient end markets, we\u2019re ensuring that we\u2019ve got the sales organizations well aligned from a resource perspective there. From a technology perspective, we\u2019ve been building capabilities across the full spectrum of solutions and certainly focused on the most pressing solutions right now. We talked about network augmentation, things like that. But we are building our cloud capabilities, our automation capabilities. Aptris was a great example of an acquisition that brought us extremely strong capabilities in a cornerstone IT software application and Scalar is another great example of doubling the size of our business up in Canada through a strategic acquisition of organization that has, from your cloud capabilities, both professional services, all the capabilities, both professional services, all the way through to managed capabilities. And we continue to add those in the US as well. You might be familiar we introduced our CDW Amplified Services last year. And one key focal area, a pillar of those services is around a multi-cloud environment. So we\u2019ll continue to focus there. The other area that I think, we all believe is going to be accelerating is helping customers with their digital needs. Digital now is a matter of survival in addition to competitive advantages. We hear it across the board. Even retail fast food organizations, who are taking a real accelerated approach to digital. Our technology organization has solutions architects as well as engineers who can support in the design and deployment of digital strategies. And so we\u2019ll expect to see more and more of that, I think, over the next few months. Those might not come to fruition perhaps until later in the year. But certainly, we are having those conversations now.\nMaggie Nolan: Thanks. And then as we think about some of the segments, obviously, you\u2019ve stated it\u2019s very difficult to see where demand is going to come from in terms of the client base. But if we think about the segments in the context of your growth strategy, in particular, picking up market share. Is there a strategic change there, particularly maybe around small business, which is something that was starting to get traction? And obviously will change in this environment? And then would be interested to hear what you\u2019re hearing from clients in higher ed and education in general as well, given some of the dynamics going in that segment at the moment.\nChristine Leahy: Yeah. Okay. So let me try and take those in order. In terms of strategic shift, the way I\u2019d think about it is our overall strategy and the value proposition to our customers, it stays the same in terms of diversified portfolio of end markets, breadth of product and services that we offer to meet the customers\u2019 needs now and in the future. In terms of new segments potentially or within segments, we also sub-segment and sub-verticalization is a focus of how we serve our partners and our customers more effectively. And so certainly, coming out of this environment, I could envision some additional sub-segmentation or markets that we serve in a different way or a more concentrated way. On the small business side, we\u2019ve been investing in our e-commerce capabilities over the last several years when we started the small business of stand-alone unit, 2.5 years ago, and we\u2019ve been seeing great results. And I would expect in this environment and in the future, that digital will play a continuing bigger role in small business. But just as it will, with respect to the rest of our segments, I expect to see kind of the human and digital combination be very strong. Within education, on the K-12, we\u2019ve seen strength there. And as you know, there\u2019s the educators are focused on access and equity. There\u2019s a large proportion of students across the world and across the US that do not have access to endpoint devices, client devices and/or the Internet. And there\u2019s quite a focus on ensuring as e-learning is expected to continue, that those devices get into their hands. And so we\u2019re helping try to support that. On the higher ed side, we saw strength in the first quarter, as we said. But equally, we think that budget, I\u2019ll call it budget concerns, as we go into the latter half of the year in a couple of the segments, could weigh on demand, and we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out.\nMaggie Nolan: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was wondering, Collin, you talked a bit about what you\u2019ve seen in the past five weeks. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more -- you mentioned stimulus or maybe, Chris, you did during your conversation. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve seen any near-term changes in discussions as some of the dollars have started to hit the small businesses as well as some of the states are starting to open up. So that\u2019s almost sort of maybe a change in conversation in the last couple of weeks? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. I think it\u2019s difficult to say, Shannon, what -- how those stimulus dollars have changed the tone of the conversation in just the past few weeks because it has been moving so quickly. I think those are part of longer-term conversations with our customers and some of the resources we bring to bear and helping them understand how those stimulus dollars are ultimately going to flow from care. So for example, in education, I think there\u2019s $13 billion -- $30 billion roughly split between higher end and K-12, and it follows public funding and title one and things like that. And helping our end-user customers understand how those funds might be made available to them and ensuring that they have their best opportunity to go ahead and access. And there\u2019ve also been modifications made to e-rate and timing changes. And again, just helping our customers understand those. So I would say, it\u2019s unlikely that it has factored into the trends that I referenced in April. I think it\u2019s more of a go-forward opportunity.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then I was curious, in the discussions with some of your customers, when obviously priority shifted during the quarter to more work from home and just business continuity. The longer-term projects that you had sort of in place, have those been canceled, pushed out? Have any customers started to revisit a time line for some of those? I am just again trying to get into the mindset of your customer base. Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Yes, Shannon, thanks for that question. All of the above, I would say. And it is such a -- I\u2019ll call it almost diverse experience, depending on the industry, depending on the customer. We have not seen a large portion of customers cancel projects. That\u2019s the number one thing. We have seen more customers who have just diverted their resources and their attention to the more urgent needs. And they\u2019re still focused on urgent needs in terms of optimizing the work from home or remote working situations that they\u2019re in. There\u2019s a lot of focus on that right now. But equally, we have seen some customers who are coming back. We\u2019ve got some larger digital transformation projects that customers have actually accelerated. And we\u2019re working with them across the board because, as I said before, it\u2019s a matter of obviously survival, but also competitive advantage coming out of this. So it\u2019s quite a wide range, and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much that we can pull out of that in way of trend. We\u2019re just staying close to our customers and ensuring that we keep the projects going forward that can. But very few have canceled, canceled, Shannon.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Matthew Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes, thanks. Good morning and thanks for all your candid answers so far. Just one quick follow-up from me regarding your comments on the Census project in federal. It sounds like trends in federal continue to be normal in terms of seasonal demand. The only change being, Collin, your discussion about some of those Census projects get pushed out from Q2 to Q4. So could you give us some more color on that and confirm that?\nCollin Kebo: Yes, Matt. As both Chris and I said, we expect federal to hold up relatively well from a budget perspective. And the time change I referenced was primarily due to the devices being in the field longer, which is spreading the revenue over a longer period of time, largely from Q2 into Q4.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. And just actually one more follow-up. Just regarding and the surge in demand, near-term demand you\u2019re seeing for work at home solutions. And you know that that\u2019s one slow trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years as is technology as a service, where there\u2019s a leasing component. Are you seeing any acceleration in that as customers look at their own capital requirements and their own balance sheets and perhaps look to that as a service model?\nCollin Kebo: Yes, Matt. I would say, I mean, in terms of the most recent surge, the objective was speed and getting it deployed rapidly. So most of that transacted in a traditional way. I think as we go forward and customers are wrestling with their own budget challenges, I think, we could see that option enter into the discussion more than it has historically. But in terms of the recent surge, it was primarily transacted in a traditional purchase model.\nMatthew Sheerin: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nPaul Coster: Yeah, quick follow-up question on work for home, if you don\u2019t mind. Has this demand drawn you into at-home sort of shipments, at-home installations, at-home maintenance of the client technology. If it has, is that a good business to be in? And is it sort of yielding in any sort of value-added opportunities of any materiality?\nChristine Leahy: Yeah, it\u2019s Chris. It has in some ways because of the urgency of getting the devices where they needed to be. And CDW\u2019s team did a really great job of moving shipments. So, you know, give you an example. When you\u2019ve got a shipment for 10,000 devices, that goes to one location. And those 10,000 devices now need to go to 10,000 locations or 5,000 locations. That\u2019s not easy to do. And the organization did a great job being flexible and responsive there. In terms of continuing to support, yes, we are adding additional hardware, software and support services to these work-from-home and remote requirements. But generally, we\u2019re - those are being managed centrally through the IT group of the organization. So it feels like it\u2019s more just a dispersed workforce, if you will, managed centrally. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re highly capable of doing. \nPaul Coster: Got it. And then, Collin, you mentioned that you sense there\u2019s a pull-forward for work-from-home, of course, that\u2019s intuitively correct. So I\u2019m just wondering at what point you\u2019ll know whether or not there\u2019s real pull-forward, and if it\u2019s sort of post factor, then I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter, but when do you think you\u2019ll know and how do you think you\u2019ll know?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah. Good question, Paul. I\u2019m not convinced we\u2019re ever really going to know because I think the wildcard here is, how much is pull-forward of something that was going to be purchased anyway versus what\u2019s an incremental use case, meaning that companies, school districts, government agencies never intended for these co-workers or students or teachers to have had mobile devices. And it\u2019s effectively a shift from their IT budget to a use case that they didn\u2019t know that they were going to need. And I think it will be nearly impossible to ultimately parse that out.\nPaul Coster: Yeah, okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: Good morning. Chris, I hope you can provide a little bit of color in terms of the ability to access client facilities. Historically, how important has that been to the CDW sales process? And I guess, as we look at the potential that, some customers may some customers may not allow any visitors on-site for the next several months. How are you guys looking at that for the next several months? And could that be an impact on sales?\nChristine Leahy: Hi, Keith. Yeah, great question. Thank you. There are a couple of different levels there. Let me just start first with the service engineers. And then move into the sales organization. Our service engineers, we broke immediately into several components, what could be done remotely and what needed to into several be done on-site and then provided them with the protective equipment and peace of mind that they could go on-site with customers. And they have been doing that and doing that very effectively. But we did break that into pieces. And remote access can get us very far in some of the work we\u2019ve had to do for work from home. Regarding our sellers, I\u2019ll come back to the comments I mentioned earlier. Certainly, in-person connections and meetings at the office, and relationship building live has always been important to any relationship sales organization. But the -- I don\u2019t want to call it surprising. But it\u2019s been a really positive discovery for me in any event is the incredible way that our sales organization is staying connected with our customers, almost more deeply than in person. So I think what we\u2019re going to start to see is, flexible ways of working. Our hybrid world will probably become our workforce hybrid world. And they\u2019ll all do what they need to do to make the connections and serve the customers and ensure that we can have learning sessions and white boarding sessions that are as effective as possible. And some of that might go back to kind of the way it was prior to this epidemic. But I also think we\u2019re going to see some significant changes. The other thing I would say is our sales organization, as you know, is a legacy inside organization that goes back a long way. And so the teams have been built with resources wrapped around them that have, in many cases, been remotely accessed. So it\u2019s not a new thing for our sellers, and our solutions architects and engineers to be on collaborative tools actually helping to solve solutions. So I hope that answers the question. I think we\u2019ll see a little bit of a new world going forward. And I feel like the team has already been effective. And we\u2019ll take the learning\u2019s and continue to drive even greater and deeper relationships with our customers.\nKeith Housum: Okay. I appreciate that. And then, Collin, just a follow-up to the commentary regarding the $29 million credit reserve. I guess how does that compare to, I guess, the average quarter? And then, are you already starting to see some credit deterioration or is this some credit deterioration or is this in anticipation of what you expect to see later in the quarter and the rest of the year?\nCollin Kebo: Yeah, Keith. I\u2019ll take the last one first. I think it\u2019s too soon to see any credit -- any material credit deterioration. I think it\u2019s in anticipation of what we expect to come down the road. When you look at our balance sheet, you\u2019ll see that at March 31st, the reserve was approximately $35 million, which is a little bit more than 1% of our outstanding customer receivable balance. Historically, that balance has been much lower. If you look at where it was at year-end or in the year ago period, it\u2019s been running around $7 million to $8 million previously. So we used a variety of data points to estimate the reserve. We looked at historical information, what our experience was back in 2008, 2009, current conditions. And again, estimates of what we think could be coming.\nKeith Housum: Great, Collin. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you. Thank you all for staying on a little longer with us. Concluding today\u2019s call, I want to once more recognize the remarkable dedication of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. They continuously reaffirm my conviction that we will enjoy better days ahead. I\u2019m so proud and grateful to be part of this team. So thank you to the team. And thank you to our customers and our partners for the privilege and opportunity to serve you during these times and to our investors and analysts for participating in this call. We appreciate you and your continuing interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Until then, stay healthy, stay safe and be well. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Christine Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Brittany. I first want to take a moment to share our respect from CDW to all who are suffering hardships or loss as we face this COVID-19 health crisis, and also to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices and contributions being made by so many who are devoting themselves to serving others. I'll begin this morning with a high level overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance. I'll also discuss how we are addressing the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our co-workers, customers and operations and share some thoughts on the balance of 2020. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter financials, as well as our liquidity position and capital allocation strategy. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for Q&A. We had a very strong first quarter. Net sales were $4.4 billion, 9.2% above last year on average daily sales basis, adjusted for the impact of one more business day in the first quarter of 2020 than 2019, and up 9.4% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income was $304 million, an increase of 5.8%. This includes a $29 million increase in our credit loss reserve to reflect the macroeconomic environment due to COVID-19. Non GAAP net income per share was $1.38, up 11% on a reported basis, and up 11.3% in constant currency. As the quarter progressed in March, we served a meaningful increase in customer demand. CDW teams orchestrated solutions for client's devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security and others from our broad portfolio to address our customer's remote work in business continuity needs. We experienced solid results across the US business with all five US channels growing high single-digits and solid local performance from our international teams. This growth came from both existing and new customers. To address anticipated supply constraints we leveraged our scale, distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, strong vendor partner relationships and healthy balance sheet and liquidity position, fulfilling our customers and prospects urgent and critical IT needs. We procured the supply in key categories early and managed through longer industry lead times for our customers in a supply-constrained environment. Our net sales performance for the quarter was balanced with 9% growth for both US hardware and software and 26% services growth. In March, customer priorities quickly redirected to remote workforce enablement and work continuity, driving strong transactional performance of almost 20%. During this time, customers de-prioritized infrastructure and less urgent service projects, resulting in a low single digit year-over-year decline for solutions. Cloud customers spend and gross profit increased double-digits drive by strong growth in collaboration, security and productivity, workloads consistent with remote workforce enablement. We generated strong double-digit growth in product categories that enabled work from home and operations continuity plan, including client devices both notebook and desktops, video, collaboration tools, configuration services and security. Our teams orchestrated a seamless combination of these products and services plus others from our broader portfolio to provide full solutions to our customers. Clearly the team delivered strong performance. I am proud of and grateful to our co-workers who persevered for our customers. Now, looking more closely at our customer end-markets performance, our corporate and Small Business teams both delivered over 8% growth, driven by double-digit growth in transactional categories as the team successfully developed work from home capabilities for our customers. The Government team increased sales almost 15%, Federal had another excellent quarter with sales up double-digits primarily driven by the census project. The state and local team also delivered double-digit growth driven by strong transactional and solutions performance that enabled remote work capability and crisis readiness efforts. Education increased 17% with strong double-digit growth in both higher ed and K-12. Customers in both markets were focused on enabling remote learning capabilities.  Our healthcare team delivered 7% growth primarily driven by transactional product categories to adapt to the new care delivery environment. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations increased 3% on a reported basis. UK was up low constant currency. That was on top of four years of first quarter double-digit growth. The UK team has been instrumental in helping with the government's response to COVID-19, providing crucial technology to the new critical care field hospitals as well as enabling remote work capabilities for our customers. Canada increased double-digits, also driven by remote work enablement and strong demand from healthcare and education customers. Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined power of our balanced portfolio of customer end-markets, our full suite of solutions and services that can address even rapidly shifting customer priorities across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. I want to take a minute to review each of these for two reasons. First, because these are important drivers of CDW's first quarter performance and second they provide frame work to think about CDW's performance under various macroeconomic condition. As you know we have five US sales channels, that each generated annual net sales of 1.5 billion in 2019. Corporate, small business, government, education, this scale enables us to further align sales teams into vertical customer end-markets, including Federal Government, State and Local Government, K-12 and higher education. Providing us insights into our customers' objectives and goals and positioning us as a trusted partner. In addition, we have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered over US$2 billion of net sales in 2019. The diversity of our customer end-markets serve us as well with macro or other external challenges impact various industries and business differently. This is especially relevant in the current environment. Next, the breadth of our offerings, with over 100,000 products, services and solutions for more than 1,000 vendor partners, we are well-positioned to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT and can pivot quickly to trends and customer demand. And, finally, our three-part strategy for growth, which is, first, to acquire new customers and capture share, second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and, third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably assess, design, deliver and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Before I turn to our thoughts about the balance of the year, I want to provide insights into our managing COVID-19 impact on our business. To holistically manage our response in mid-February, we activated a cross-functional response team led by executive committee members. The team leveraged our pre-established crisis management protocols to ensure we responded as quickly as possible. The team has three key principles, safe guard the health and well-being of our co-workers, serve the mission-driven needs of our customers and partners, and support ours communities. One of the key actions, we took to maintain the impact of the virus on our customers, on our co-workers and our operations was to implement a global work-from-home order from office co-workers in mid-March. We have excellent IT infrastructure and support so the transition to work from home was shift and seamless. We are monitoring developments closely, developing plans accordingly, and we will be prepared for our return to office at the appropriate time. We are focused on our co-workers' safety and well-being in the workplace. To do this at our three distribution and configuration centers, we are operating under precautionary measures advised by public health authorities, including social distancing, segment and shift, personnel protective equipment, enhanced facilities cleaning and temperature screening for anyone entering the facilities. Currently, all distribution and configuration centers are fully operational. At the end of March to limit the virus spread after a few co-workers tested positive for COVID-19, we decide to close our Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center for several days and to require a shift to configuration center co-workers to self-isolate. These actions did not have a material impact as the team's leveraged flexibility in our distribution and capabilities where possible. Our distribution center in Las Vegas fulfilled customer orders and orders were drop shifted directly to customers, and where not shipping times modestly increased. I regard our exceptional co-workers and our unique culture to be a meaningful competitive advantage. Our team has responded to the current environment in exemplary ways. One example is our internal dig marketplace created to match areas of our business where demand has spiked, with internal talent on temporary assignment. Another example is the reallocating of our sales and technical resources to where the growth is and will be going, which we successfully did during the great recession. We will again be nimble by identifying and implementing ways to optimally utilize our highly skilled co-workers. In addition and consistent with our strong culture of giving CDW has and continues to contribute meaningfully to support the COVID-19 response efforts locally in the US, UK and Canada. Now let me turn to our 2020 financial performance. As a result of COVID-19 and the unknown duration and depth of its impact, we withdrew our 2020 targets on April 16, as most all companies are doing. The near term impact of COVID-19 on some customers we serve could be meaningful, with some ed markets impacted more significantly than others. Consistent with prior experience where commercial customers have reacted relatively quickly to economic conditions, we anticipate the demand will be lower for some of our small business and corporate customers. We expect demand from our public customers to be relatively firmer, led by resiliency in our federal channel, due to the Census project and the IT priorities we support, including infrastructure upgrades and security enhancements to remain top priorities. Demand will likely be next for our other public channels, with budget uncertainty for healthcare, state and local and education customers. We continue to track stimulus support and, where possible, help our customers navigate the various programs. Regarding product categories, we expect customers to prioritize mission-critical IT spending and for some to push out longer term solutions projects, including infrastructure projects and service engagement. In recent weeks, our focus has shifted to helping our customers manage their work from home environments at scale. Solutions that \u2013 solution for that includes security, network augmentation to accommodate new demand, remote performance management, virtual desktops and effective application management. Longer term, we expect our customers and prospective customers to design and implement technology driven strategies to not just survive, but to thrive. We expect to see an acceleration in digital transformation, cloud migration and automation strategies, as companies invest to successfully compete in the future. We believe that technology will be as or more essential to all sectors of our economy, and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We intend to continue to help our customers navigate the complex IT landscape. During our 35 year history, CDW has a successful track record of evolving with customer needs in the ever-evolving IT industry. We are committed to continuing to invest in our three-part strategy, including capabilities that will position us to best serve our customers, optimize our productivity and enhance our competitive position. As we do so, we will keep a watchful eye on the impact of COVID-19, the macro environment, and other unpredictable variables, such as potential supply disruptions, trade policies and the upcoming US election. CDW will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objective. And out-execute our competition. While this is a particularly uncertain and challenging time for all, I'm confident that CDW will continue to grow to new heights. Now Collin will share more details on our financial performance. Collin? Okay. Hi Amit, good morning, it's Chris, and I'll start, and then Collin can add in. When we think back to the 2009 recession, first of all, I would say, as we all know, two downturns are the same. And with respect to where we sit today, we can't tell with any level of certainty what's going to happen. This is that essence, the health crisis and the economic issues are derivative. But if we look back to 2008 and \u201809, it can be informative. So, if we look at the segments, corporate and small business, they did tend to react more quickly, as Collin suggested in his script to the downturn. And if you look at our investor deck, you can see that corporate was down 22% and small business declined small business declined 18%, so significantly. The public sector channels, as we've mentioned, were more resilient, and we saw growth in government and education. Health care was a little flat. But I would think about coming out of the recession, we saw corporate, small business and health care grow quite nicely. And if you think about similarities, the business model that we have, the resiliency of that business model, our ability to stick with our customers and to offer them a wide slot of products, particularly coming out of the recession, remains strong. As I think about today, we are in a stronger financial position than we were in 2008 and \u201809. And I remember, Amit, meeting interest obligations in \u201809, when we were at 10 times debt leverage, which was our peak. Today, we have, obviously, a strong balance sheet. And we have more opportunistic outlook. I would also say that, technology today has become much more essential to our customers' strategy, hard stop. There's been increasing complexity. The breadth of our portfolio, what we sell, our evolution, has grown. And so today, we're better positioned than ever to help our customers through this downturn. But the lack of visibility that we all have still makes it difficult to predict with any level of certainty. Collin? Yeah. Amit, I'd add one more thing. And I'll come back to your second question is when you think about the complexion of our resources. And remember, we've got over 3,000 technologists today. And we're really very well positioned to support customers and where they're heading. As we think about what might accelerate coming out of this current situation, we've got physical distance. Digital is now mandatory. It's a prerequisite for market survival, frankly. And we're very well positioned to help our customers with that. But on your second question on taking market share, we did acquire a healthy dose of new customers. We had product to offer them. And we could get it to them quickly. So we feel confident that we were able to take share in this environment. Sure. Matt, it's Chris, and I'll start, and then Collin, you can add in. Listen, you know we have a naturally variable cost structure. And just as it did in 2008 and \u201809, we benefit from that as we go through downturns like this. I would say that we've been proactive and prudent. We consider to manage our business prudently, part of what we need to do every day. But the team has been at this in a very granular level on a daily basis, watching a couple of things. Obviously, demand we're very focused on sales trends by channel, gross profit that we're seeing in NGLI and we're managing that and looking at that more closely than we ever had. Obviously from a liquidity position, Collins and his team have been very granular around our cash collections and other things that impact our liquidity. So I would say, number one, we've been very proactive and very detail oriented and making changes and moves quickly, as opposed to waiting. As Collin mentioned in his prepared remarks, I think we've already done things like change events and other expenses that we can do. We do have a performance excellence team and we've talked about this before, it's called reinvent to reinvest and they have - they've actually contributed meaningfully over the past few years to our results. And they are laser focused on our operating model and ensuring that we are being as efficient and effective as we possibly can. So as we go through this frankly, what we're doing is we're managing the business, but we aren't being shy about, really finding places to improve from an operational perspective of the business, so that we can continue to invest as we move forward. And some of that might be not moving some resources, we're working on that. We've got resources that actually can flex across the business. That's part of the beauty of the types of sellers and technical folks that we have in terms of their experience and their capabilities and our training programs, which are such an engine for us. So we're also moving resources on the right opportunities. Collin? Yeah. Matt, I want to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about customers; you're talking about others within the channel that are competitors for CDW? Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think, look, when there is a downturn of any kind that is severe, it exposes weaknesses across any industry. And not like - not unlike other industries, I think we will see that certainly in our industry. And as we've said, we'll continue to keep our eye on opportunistic M&A. And I wouldn't say that we would - you've heard me say this before, I wouldn't say that we're focused on a roll up, but we certainly are focused on M&A that fits our various lenses that you know well. It's strategic fit, operational fit, cultural fit, makes financial sense. We haven't turned that lens off, and we will continue to look. Yeah, good morning. It's Chris on the co-workers, we have a north of 80% of our co-workers are now work from home, and the others are in our distribution centers configuration centers and onsite engineers and a few security folks are also on site, so it's a fairly large portion of our workforce. And, I'll give kudos to our technology teams and all of those individuals because the move to work from home was swift and seamless. Our IT infrastructure was ready to go. And it was almost eerie how few hiccups we had on that Monday morning. My view on their productivity is it's been incredibly strong and in many ways, you might have heard this from other companies. This is driving even higher levels of productivity in some areas and greater connection between our own workforce and with our customers, it's been really quite interesting to see. In terms of dimensionalizing impact from COVID-19 on the numbers, I just think that's almost impossible to do. As we mentioned, we know we saw the surge in March because of work-from-home and remote work needs. And now there were some pull forward redirection of investment into that first quarter. But to quantify it just seems impossible to do. Yeah. I'll take your question, Katy. Good morning. On cloud, as you know, we've been building our capabilities around cloud and the hybrid multi-cloud work environment now for years. And when we think about cloud generally, I think about it adding even more complexity to the choices that our customers need to make and you add the uncertainty of the world that we're in today, there's even another layer of complexity. Even simple cloud choices like the video and call solutions that we all are using now creates complexity for the IT staff as they've got to enable co-workers to use it consistently, and at high-performance levels, et cetera. So this plays very well into our value proposition. We have, as you know, I think, we have over 250 cloud offerings on our line card, and we're essentially \u2013 our value prop is we're vendor and technology and consumption and consumption agnostic. So we can play that trusted adviser role for organizations as they're sorting through what their strategies ought to be. And frankly, when we talk to customers now, the questions, because they're moving so quickly, is help us figure this out, what should we do, how should we do it? We're having those types of questions around assessing and design more frequently than ever before. So you think about professional services, managed services for public and hybrid cloud. Those are areas that we have been investing and we'll continue to invest in. So we can help our customers assess their options, where to migrate and how to evaluate how to integrate, how to support the deployment and then how to manage cloud workloads. So I would say, it's a full spectrum from a CES design, integrate and manage across a multi-cloud world. Yeah, Hi, Maggie. So in connection with the resources, yeah, think about it a couple of different ways. One is you think \u2013 I think about our sales organization and where demand is and how we can help generate demand and also help customers facilitate through stimulus packages and things like that. So some of the more resilient end markets, we're ensuring that we've got the sales organizations well aligned from a resource perspective there. From a technology perspective, we've been building capabilities across the full spectrum of solutions and certainly focused on the most pressing solutions right now. We talked about network augmentation, things like that. But we are building our cloud capabilities, our automation capabilities. Aptris was a great example of an acquisition that brought us extremely strong capabilities in a cornerstone IT software application and Scalar is another great example of doubling the size of our business up in Canada through a strategic acquisition of organization that has, from your cloud capabilities, both professional services, all the capabilities, both professional services, all the way through to managed capabilities. And we continue to add those in the US as well. You might be familiar we introduced our CDW Amplified Services last year. And one key focal area, a pillar of those services is around a multi-cloud environment. So we'll continue to focus there. The other area that I think, we all believe is going to be accelerating is helping customers with their digital needs. Digital now is a matter of survival in addition to competitive advantages. We hear it across the board. Even retail fast food organizations, who are taking a real accelerated approach to digital. Our technology organization has solutions architects as well as engineers who can support in the design and deployment of digital strategies. And so we'll expect to see more and more of that, I think, over the next few months. Those might not come to fruition perhaps until later in the year. But certainly, we are having those conversations now. Yeah. Okay. So let me try and take those in order. In terms of strategic shift, the way I'd think about it is our overall strategy and the value proposition to our customers, it stays the same in terms of diversified portfolio of end markets, breadth of product and services that we offer to meet the customers' needs now and in the future. In terms of new segments potentially or within segments, we also sub-segment and sub-verticalization is a focus of how we serve our partners and our customers more effectively. And so certainly, coming out of this environment, I could envision some additional sub-segmentation or markets that we serve in a different way or a more concentrated way. On the small business side, we've been investing in our e-commerce capabilities over the last several years when we started the small business of stand-alone unit, 2.5 years ago, and we've been seeing great results. And I would expect in this environment and in the future, that digital will play a continuing bigger role in small business. But just as it will, with respect to the rest of our segments, I expect to see kind of the human and digital combination be very strong. Within education, on the K-12, we've seen strength there. And as you know, there's the educators are focused on access and equity. There's a large proportion of students across the world and across the US that do not have access to endpoint devices, client devices and/or the Internet. And there's quite a focus on ensuring as e-learning is expected to continue, that those devices get into their hands. And so we're helping try to support that. On the higher ed side, we saw strength in the first quarter, as we said. But equally, we think that budget, I'll call it budget concerns, as we go into the latter half of the year in a couple of the segments, could weigh on demand, and we'll have to see how that plays out. Yes. Yes, Shannon, thanks for that question. All of the above, I would say. And it is such a -- I'll call it almost diverse experience, depending on the industry, depending on the customer. We have not seen a large portion of customers cancel projects. That's the number one thing. We have seen more customers who have just diverted their resources and their attention to the more urgent needs. And they're still focused on urgent needs in terms of optimizing the work from home or remote working situations that they're in. There's a lot of focus on that right now. But equally, we have seen some customers who are coming back. We've got some larger digital transformation projects that customers have actually accelerated. And we're working with them across the board because, as I said before, it's a matter of obviously survival, but also competitive advantage coming out of this. So it's quite a wide range, and I'm not sure there's much that we can pull out of that in way of trend. We're just staying close to our customers and ensuring that we keep the projects going forward that can. But very few have canceled, canceled, Shannon. Yeah, it's Chris. It has in some ways because of the urgency of getting the devices where they needed to be. And CDW's team did a really great job of moving shipments. So, you know, give you an example. When you've got a shipment for 10,000 devices, that goes to one location. And those 10,000 devices now need to go to 10,000 locations or 5,000 locations. That's not easy to do. And the organization did a great job being flexible and responsive there. In terms of continuing to support, yes, we are adding additional hardware, software and support services to these work-from-home and remote requirements. But generally, we're - those are being managed centrally through the IT group of the organization. So it feels like it's more just a dispersed workforce, if you will, managed centrally. And that's something that we're highly capable of doing. Hi, Keith. Yeah, great question. Thank you. There are a couple of different levels there. Let me just start first with the service engineers. And then move into the sales organization. Our service engineers, we broke immediately into several components, what could be done remotely and what needed to into several be done on-site and then provided them with the protective equipment and peace of mind that they could go on-site with customers. And they have been doing that and doing that very effectively. But we did break that into pieces. And remote access can get us very far in some of the work we've had to do for work from home. Regarding our sellers, I'll come back to the comments I mentioned earlier. Certainly, in-person connections and meetings at the office, and relationship building live has always been important to any relationship sales organization. But the -- I don't want to call it surprising. But it's been a really positive discovery for me in any event is the incredible way that our sales organization is staying connected with our customers, almost more deeply than in person. So I think what we're going to start to see is, flexible ways of working. Our hybrid world will probably become our workforce hybrid world. And they'll all do what they need to do to make the connections and serve the customers and ensure that we can have learning sessions and white boarding sessions that are as effective as possible. And some of that might go back to kind of the way it was prior to this epidemic. But I also think we're going to see some significant changes. The other thing I would say is our sales organization, as you know, is a legacy inside organization that goes back a long way. And so the teams have been built with resources wrapped around them that have, in many cases, been remotely accessed. So it's not a new thing for our sellers, and our solutions architects and engineers to be on collaborative tools actually helping to solve solutions. So I hope that answers the question. I think we'll see a little bit of a new world going forward. And I feel like the team has already been effective. And we'll take the learning's and continue to drive even greater and deeper relationships with our customers. Thank you. Thank you all for staying on a little longer with us. Concluding today's call, I want to once more recognize the remarkable dedication of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. They continuously reaffirm my conviction that we will enjoy better days ahead. I'm so proud and grateful to be part of this team. So thank you to the team. And thank you to our customers and our partners for the privilege and opportunity to serve you during these times and to our investors and analysts for participating in this call. We appreciate you and your continuing interest in and support of CDW. Collin and I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Until then, stay healthy, stay safe and be well. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our first quarter results and capital allocation priorities in the current environment. Turning to our first quarter P&L on slide nine, consolidated net sales were $4.4 billion, up 10.9% on a reported basis, and 9.2% on an average daily sales basis, as we had one additional selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 9.4%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 4.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. This was better than expected and historical seasonality. As the quarter progressed and we moved into March, the impact of COVID-19 led to a meaningful increase in customer demand for client devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security and other solutions to keep other solutions to keep customers' operations running. While there were pockets of supply dislocation, as Chris mentioned, we leveraged our scale and distribution capabilities to help customers get access to the IT they needed for business continuity. Some portion of the record monthly sales we achieved in March is likely attributable to a pull forward of future demand, but it's difficult to quantify at quantify at this point. Gross profit for the quarter was $757 million, an increase of 12.6%. Gross margin was 17.2%, up 20 basis points over last year, driven by product margin and services, partially offset by netted down revenue streams not growing as fast as net sales. Turning to our SG&A on slide 10, our non-GAAP SG&A increased 17.6%. The increase was primarily driven by a $29 million increase in our credit loss reserve to reflect the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of COVID-19. SG&A also reflects higher payroll costs consistent with higher co-worker count and higher gross profit as well as roughly $2 million of incremental COVID-19 expenses, primarily to safeguard our co-workers. Co-worker count of 10,104 was up 670 co-workers from March 2019, with approximately 100 of the year-over-year increase from the Atheros acquisition and the remaining from organic co-worker investments. Roughly 60% of the 670 co-workers added year-over-year are in customer-facing roles. As you know, we have a variable cost structure, given that sales commissions are paid on a percentage of gross profit and growth in co-worker count is one of our biggest investments. We have implemented hiring restrictions and are letting attrition run for a while as we closely monitor the macroeconomic and demand environments. GAAP operating income was $246 million, up 7.4%. Our non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $304 million, an increase of 5.8%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 6.9%. Moving to slide 11, interest expense was $38 million for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on slide 12, was 20.7% in the quarter, up 50 basis points compared to last year. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $44 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, including excess tax benefits associated with equity-based compensation, which is shown on slide 13. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 10 basis points versus last year's rate. As you can see on slide 14, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $145 million, GAAP net income per share $1.16, up 13.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $200 million in the quarter, up 7.9% over last year. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.38, up 11% from last year. The increase in the credit loss reserve equates to approximately $0.15 per share. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 15, liquidity is a clear priority in the current environment. As of March 31st, cash and cash equivalents were $214 million and net debt was $3.3 billion. Our cash plus revolver availability was $1.2 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we bolstered our liquidity position by issuing $600 million of senior unsecured notes at a coupon of 4.8% for general corporate purposes. Additional measures to enhance liquidity includes suspending share repurchases and implementing various cost savings initiatives. Free cash flow for the quarter was $116 million, as shown on slide 16. This is lower than normal seasonality and below last year's $303 million for several reasons. One, because sales growth was back-end loaded in the quarter, the receivables associated with those sales are sitting on the March 31 balance sheet. Two, we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. And three, we leveraged our scale and distribution centers to increase investment in inventory to better support customers in a supply-constrained environment. Moving to slide 17. The three month average cash conversion cycle was 20 days, up 3 days from last year's first quarter. The balance sheet dynamics I just described are somewhat moderated when you look at three month average working capital metrics because of how sales phasing played out in the quarter. Looking ahead, our working capital metrics could be impacted as we strategically invest in inventory or due to pressure on receivable collections as customers are impacted by the macroeconomic environment. One of our greatest assets is our long-term customer relationships, and we know it's important to be there for customers during challenging times like we were during the Great Recession. We will continue to balance managing customer's working capital needs, while appropriately managing risk. For the quarter, we deployed a $195 million of cash to shareholders, which included $54 million of dividend and $141 million of share repurchase at an average price of approximately $123 per share. Turning to capital allocation on slide 18. As I mentioned earlier we are focused on liquidity and have reassessed other uses of capital within that context. Our priorities are, first, continue to pay the dividend. Today, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per common share, reflecting CDW's strong liquidity position and confidence in the cash flow generation capability of the business. We expect to evaluate any changes in the dividend in the fourth quarter of this year consistent with historical timing. Future dividends will be subject to board approval. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We remain comfortable with the current target net leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times for several reasons. One, we have no debt maturities in 2020 and just $57 million, due in 2022. Two, the weighted average interest rate on the debt portfolio was 3.9% pro forma for the $600 million notes issued in April. So cash interest is manageable. And three, our debt capital structure was covenant light. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 2.2 times slightly below the low end of our target range and flat to year end 2019. Our third capital allocation priority is to supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions, a challenging economic environment could present attractive M&A opportunities. So we remain active in evaluating targets. Any decision to deploy capital for acquisitions will be a function of our usual screens, strategic rationale, operating and cultural fit and financial return all within the context of liquidity at that point in time. Fourth, as I noted previously, we suspended our share repurchase program to enhance liquidity with first quarter buybacks of 1.1 million shares. We have already offset expected dilution associated with stock compensation for this year. The decision on when to resume stock buybacks will depend on several considerations, including the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and working capital, leverage and other potential uses of cash, such as M&A. Lastly, on the topic of capital. We intend to continue capital expenditure investments in the business. We have a CapEx light model, historically, running around 0.5 point of sales or slightly more. We believe it's important to continue prudently investing in the capabilities that will allow us to better serve customers, drive productivity and ultimately emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. While we have withdrawn 2020 targets, and will not be providing an updated financial outlook, I do want to provide insights into what we're seeing roughly five weeks into the quarter. On the demand side, customer activity has been mixed. We entered April with a healthy backlog of remote workforce enablement solutions, which contributed to solid shipment growth in April. However, writings and corporate and small business were down double digits year-over-year, which will weigh on shipments going forward. This is consistent with past experience, where we've seen commercial customers react sooner to macroeconomic conditions. On the other hand, public sector writings were up year-over-year, reflecting strength in government and K-12 and more muted demand in higher education and health care. Our international businesses are generally seeing similar trends with their customers. You may recall that both the UK and Canada have a lower mix of sales to public sector customers than the US. On the supply side, we continue to navigate through a fluid environment with pockets of dislocation extending lead times in certain categories. We are in constant contact with our vendor partners whose manufacturing operations are generally back up and running. Freight is a challenge, resulting in pricing surcharges and price increases on certain products. On the operating front, both distribution centers in the US continue to be fully operational since the brief closure of our Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center at the end of March. Finally, I want to provide an update on the device as a service solution to the US Census Bureau. The contribution to first quarter sales was generally in line with expectations. In March, the Census Bureau temporarily suspended field data collection activities and steps are being taken to reactivate field offices next month. In April, the Census Bureau announced it was seeking statutory relief from Congress for an additional 120 days, which would extend the window for field data collection and self-response to October 31. The delay is expected to shift a modest amount of net sales from to Q4 from Q2. Finally, we are working with the Census Bureau to help meet the customers' objective of making up lost time due to COVID-19. CDW expects to provide additional devices, enabling the Census to have more workers in the field. As a result of these changes, we now expect the Census project to contribute up to approximately 140 basis of incremental sales growth in 2020. The rollout schedule is fluid, so we could see revenue shift from 2020 into 2021. We will continue to provide updates on the Census as we progress through 2020. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Olivia to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one, with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yeah, Chris. I don't know that I have much more to add to that. That was a pretty thorough review. I mean, as you think about, the various channels, as we've said corporate small business reacted sooner. GDP bottomed, I think, in the fourth quarter of 2008 and then improved sequentially. It was still down a bit year-over-year over the next couple of quarters. We saw corporate and small business react very swiftly in the first quarter of \u201809. So that first quarter declined more than the full year. And then, the rates of decline improved as we move throughout the year. But as Chris said, look, every recession like this is different, so not much more to add other than that. Yeah. I guess I would just add, again, Matt, we have a variable cost structure. Sales compensation, pay down gross profit is our biggest expense. And our biggest investment is in people cost and so letting attrition run add some variability to the cost structure. Obviously, we've taken a look at other parts of the cost structure, travel, events and things like that that don't make sense in this environment. As Chris mentioned, ongoing productivity and efficiency is a part of the culture, and we've dialed that up. And we'll continue to be disciplined in managing costs, and we'll make adjustments based on market conditions and the demand \u2013 the demand environment as we go down the road here. But we are going to prudently invest in the business, so that we do emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. Yeah, sure. I would say, I think we used the word fluid or dynamic. It's choppy out there. We are running heavy on inventory just because we felt it made sense to carry additional days of safety stock. We provide pre-orders to some of our customers, and they get a lot of benefit out of that. So we're doing that to try to mitigate some of the choppiness in the market. I would say, unsurprisingly, there's a lot of demand for notebooks. So that's where we have taken some of our inventory positions, as well as within the Chromebook market, obviously, given the strain that this has placed on our education systems. And then I would say we've seen lead times pick up in some other categories on the solutions side of the business in servers. It's not, I would say, disruptive per se, but just extended lead times. And then I did comment a little bit about where we have seen some price increases, and that's primarily due to just increased freight costs that our OEM vendor partners are incurring and the passing along of some of those costs. So we have seen some price increases in client devices as well as within servers. Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Adam. I think in terms of the $600 million, just in this kind of environment, given the uncertainty and with the wide range of outcomes out there and very difficult to probability assess where those outcomes are going to be, we just felt it was prudent to go and get excess liquidity. And I think most companies in corporate America that have the ability to do so, went ahead and did that we were able to get it at an attractive rate at four and an eight. So, we viewed it as relatively inexpensive insurance in case you know these outcomes, go to a more bearish place, but in the event we don't need the insurance. It's relatively cheap capital that we can deploy offensively. In terms of what we would do with that, we are mindful of the pressure that that's out there for customers, so I think in terms of investing in working capital. I talked a fair amount about potentially using some of that within inventory and to help smooth out some of the disruption, that's out there and that would competitively advantage CDW as well as help our customers get access to the IT they need sooner rather than later. From a receivables perspective, obviously our customers are under pressure and they're managing their own liquidity circumstances and looking at their cost structures and things like that. One of the things that CDW does is we orchestrate financing solutions for our customers, so obviously our OEM vendor partners and others make financing available and so we've been very active in making those solutions available to our customers and that obviously helps both the customer, but also helps us manage our DSO risk. There are certain situations where customers are under pressure and we'll deal with those on a case-by-case basis. In terms of how we're managing risk, we did a pretty thorough review of the portfolio in terms of credit limits and where we had exposures to various industries and customers and adjusted credit risk appropriately. Again managing or balancing some of these long standing customer relationships we have, while still protecting the balance sheet and ensuring we had an appropriate risk profile in place. And obviously again like every other company in corporate America we are very closely monitoring our daily cash collections and understanding where risks might be emerging in the portfolio and then adjusting credit limits accordingly. Thanks, Adam. Yes, I mean as we commented in the prepared remarks, Ruplu, client devices, very strong in the quarter and particularly as we exited the quarter. And also in my prepared comments, I talked about how we had a pretty healthy backlog then that we carried into April that contributed to solid shipment growth. You can assume that a lot of that was in the client device category. In terms of 100% gross margin items, they did not grow as fast as the rest of the business in the first quarter. I think that was largely driven by the focus on client devices and video and accessories and all the other things that you would need to enable, work-from-home and learn from home and things like that. I think it remains to be seen what's going to happen as we go forward in terms of how some of those 100% gross margin items perform. It's logical that those things are cloud, we'd see strong growth on a go forward basis in previous environments, when things have slowed down, we have seen customers sweat assets. And you can see warranties and software assurance and things like that pick up as well. But I think we'll need to see what happens over the next few quarters here before I'd want to make a more definitive call on what happens with that portion of that business. Yes. Katy, I'll take the first one and maybe Chris will take the second. Just to clarify my comments. When I was talking about what we were seeing, those were comments really for the first five weeks of the second quarter, so primarily April. And when I said shipments, we saw solid growth as a result of the backlog. You can think of that as equivalent to revenue. When we talk about writings or bookings, and that's what I referred to as being down double-digits in corporate and small business, those at some point turn into future shipments or invoices. So that's more of a leading indicator. Hopefully, that clarifies it for it. Yeah. Okay. And then I think... Yes. I think it's difficult to say, Shannon, what -- how those stimulus dollars have changed the tone of the conversation in just the past few weeks because it has been moving so quickly. I think those are part of longer-term conversations with our customers and some of the resources we bring to bear and helping them understand how those stimulus dollars are ultimately going to flow from care. So for example, in education, I think there's $13 billion -- $30 billion roughly split between higher end and K-12, and it follows public funding and title one and things like that. And helping our end-user customers understand how those funds might be made available to them and ensuring that they have their best opportunity to go ahead and access. And there've also been modifications made to e-rate and timing changes. And again, just helping our customers understand those. So I would say, it's unlikely that it has factored into the trends that I referenced in April. I think it's more of a go-forward opportunity. Yes, Matt. As both Chris and I said, we expect federal to hold up relatively well from a budget perspective. And the time change I referenced was primarily due to the devices being in the field longer, which is spreading the revenue over a longer period of time, largely from Q2 into Q4. Yes, Matt. I would say, I mean, in terms of the most recent surge, the objective was speed and getting it deployed rapidly. So most of that transacted in a traditional way. I think as we go forward and customers are wrestling with their own budget challenges, I think, we could see that option enter into the discussion more than it has historically. But in terms of the recent surge, it was primarily transacted in a traditional purchase model. Yeah. Good question, Paul. I'm not convinced we're ever really going to know because I think the wildcard here is, how much is pull-forward of something that was going to be purchased anyway versus what's an incremental use case, meaning that companies, school districts, government agencies never intended for these co-workers or students or teachers to have had mobile devices. And it's effectively a shift from their IT budget to a use case that they didn't know that they were going to need. And I think it will be nearly impossible to ultimately parse that out. Yeah, Keith. I'll take the last one first. I think it's too soon to see any credit -- any material credit deterioration. I think it's in anticipation of what we expect to come down the road. When you look at our balance sheet, you'll see that at March 31st, the reserve was approximately $35 million, which is a little bit more than 1% of our outstanding customer receivable balance. Historically, that balance has been much lower. If you look at where it was at year-end or in the year ago period, it's been running around $7 million to $8 million previously. So we used a variety of data points to estimate the reserve. We looked at historical information, what our experience was back in 2008, 2009, current conditions. And again, estimates of what we think could be coming."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll begin our call with an overview of our full year and fourth quarter performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2022. Then I'll hand the call over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.  2021 was a year of both strong financial performance and strategic progress. The teams delivered $21 billion in net sales with excellent profitability. Margins improved and our 13% increase in sales translated to a 17% increase in both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases amplified this growth and non GAAP net income per share increased 21% to $7.97.  These exceptional results demonstrate the power of our resilient business model, a model that has enabled us to deliver industry-leading performance year after year, including through the past two years of a global health crisis, unprecedented supply interruptions and evolving customer priorities.  You see the power of our model and the performance across our balanced portfolio of customer end markets over the past two years. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels:\u2013 corporate; small business; health care; government, which includes federal and state and local customers; and education with K-12 and higher ed.  We also have our UK and Canadian operations each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own right. Often different factors impact customer end markets, sometimes macro and sometimes industry specific. This was the case over the past two years as customers across our diverse end markets experienced the impact of the pandemic very differently.  In 2020, public customer spend, fueled by education and government, offset commercial and international declines and net sales increased 2%. In 2021, our 13% sales increase was powered by strong commercial and international customer spend, which more than offset flat public sales.  The past two years also highlighted the power of our business model in our product and solutions performance, with more than 100,000 products and solutions from over 1,000 leading and emerging brands. We are well positioned to meet our customers' needs, whether transactional or highly complex.  In 2020, customers prioritized remote enablement and continuity. Transactions increased driven by the ability to deliver endpoint solutions to meet unprecedented work from home and learn from home needs. At the same time, solutions declined as customers focus their spend on addressing critical endpoint projects. In 2021, while work from home and learn from home enablement remained key priorities, customers reprioritized investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure, platforms and endpoints. Both transactions and solutions increased.  Our ability to help customers address their priorities during two years of unprecedented supply challenge is another example of the power of our business model. We leveraged our competitive advantages, our distribution centers, our extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the environment. And our sellers and technical coworkers helped customers find alternative solutions from our deep portfolio whenever possible.  In 2020, we were able to deliver more than 11 million client devices despite meaningful supply shortages in endpoint devices. In 2021, while facing extended lead times for transactions and solutions, we delivered solid growth in both categories.  As you can see, our resilient business model had a significant impact on our ability to profitably grow during an unprecedented period. Looking at performance over the past two years, net sales are up 15% since 2019 and our annual net sales compound growth rate was 7.5%. Profitability improved at a faster rate with compound annual growth rates for gross profit and non-GAAP operating income of 8% and 10%, respectively.  Of course, our business model is not the only component of our formula to profitably outgrow the U.S. market. Our success would not be possible without the dedication of our talented team of 14,000 coworkers, including the more than 2,600 new Sirius coworkers who joined us in December. During the past two years, time and again, CDW coworkers demonstrated why they are so vital to our ability to successfully deliver industry-leading performance year after year.  Let's take a closer look at what the teams delivered for the fourth quarter. For the quarter, net sales were $5.5 billion, including $197 million of results from Sirius, which closed on December 1. On an average daily sales and constant currency basis, net sales increased 9.6%.  Non-GAAP net income was $285 million in the quarter, up 8.2%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.08, up 14% from last year. The teams leveraged the combination of our broad and deep portfolio, extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate full outcomes to address customers' priorities across all of our customer end markets. Outcomes that deliver five key organizational benefits \u2013 innovation, lower cost, agility, risk mitigation and enhanced experiences for customers and coworkers.  Let's take a look. Corporate delivered a 33% increase with excellent performance across both transactions and solutions. Digital transformation, agility and security remained top priorities. Endpoint solutions remained a key focus area and the team delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth in client devices. Small business delivered another exceptional quarter, up 31%, with strong growth across both transactions and solutions. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement. Security performance was up mid-teens as the team helped customers address risk mitigation needs, delivering penetration testing and incident response as well as backup and recovery solutions.  On the public side of the business, excellent performance in both healthcare and higher ed was not enough to offset expected declines in government and K-12, and total public net sales declined to 13%. Healthcare's 20% increase continued to reflect return to projects that had been put on hold.  Security remained a top priority. Cloud adoption was strong, in part driven by efficiency needs as customers dealt with COVID-19 and acute care. The expected decline in federal reflected the lumpy nature of government contracts as the teams faced two meaningful overlaps in the fourth quarter of 2020, the wind down of our devices and service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and a large client device program. Results also reflected the impact of slowness in contracting practices we shared last quarter. We are beginning to see greenshoots and there's no change to our expectation that trends will reverse later in 2022.  State and local posted a high-single digit decline. The team delivered a high-single digit increase in solutions, driven by helping customers upgrade security. This could not overcome the team's 2020 strong fourth quarter performance when they helped customers take advantage of the year-end use-it-or-lose-it CARE funds. As we shared last quarter, we continue to help our customers work through the planning required to evaluate multiple funding opportunities and multi-year phasing and expect funded projects to begin implementation as we move through 2022.  Higher ed strong double-digit performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12, and overall education sales increased 9% on top of 2020 fourth quarter remarkable 142% growth. Higher ed growth reflected our ability to meet growing demand for student success programs. These programs use technology to give institutions an edge, including comprehensive endpoint solutions, improved security, campus connectivity as well as enhancing the dorm room experience.  The K-12 team delivered excellent net sales performance against very tough unseasonal fourth quarter 2022 compares. Consistent with expectations we've previously shared, net sales declined. Although down year over year, fourth quarter client device sales were more than double a typical pre-COVID fourth quarter.  Both the UK and Canada delivered high teens local market growth. Combined in our other results, average daily sales for these two markets increased 20% in US dollars. Customer priorities in both markets were similar to those in the US.  Our success addressing customer priorities is evident in our fourth quarter portfolio performance where we delivered balanced growth across transactions and solutions both increasing mid-single digits.  On the transaction side, client devices increased mid-single digits. While client device supply improved in some areas and we were able to help more customers adopt alternative providers, overall supply remained constrained and we exited the year with an elevated backlog. Tight supply continued to impact prices which our teams were generally able to pass along. Video and audio delivered another impressive quarter.  Solutions growth was driven by strong software and servers performance. Writings remain strong as customers turn to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and entire lifecycle. Lead times extended in several key solutions areas, notably netcom, enterprise storage and servers. Remaining solutions orders increased at year-end.  Once again, the team delivered strong double-digit growth in cloud, driven by robust growth in security, infrastructure as a service, and productivity. Security cloud growth was driven by the success of our comprehensive strategy of security assessments, data protection and threat mitigation with many solutions delivered via cloud and software. Overall security spend in the quarter increased mid-teens.  Our ability to meet customer needs in the quarter across the IT continuum translated into a mid-single digit US hardware sales, 20% increase in software and more than 50% increase in services. Services growth reflected the ongoing success of our strategy and was balanced across professional and managed services. Recent acquisitions are paying off, contributing meaningfully to this quarter's growth.  So, as you can see, our fourth quarter delivered a strong finish to an excellent year of financial performance. 2021 was also a year of excellent strategic progress against our three-part strategy for growth, which is to first acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, extend our services capabilities. In 2021, we made excellent progress against all three of these pillars. Acquisitions made during the year, Focal Point, Amplified IT and Sirius, as well as integration progress for our 2020 acquisitions at IGNW and Aptris furthered our strategy to bolster our services capabilities.  Deep services capabilities are critical to our ability to deliver full organizational outcomes across the full stack and the entire lifecycle. This is an important source of differentiation in the marketplace.  Let me share a quick example of how this is showing up in our performance. Our acquisition of Amplified IT in August deepened our already strong offering in the education space, particularly in the Google ecosystem, which is the largest education platform in the US.  Amplified IT's expertise as a systems integrator enables us to facilitate end-to-end solutions for education customers. This leads to greater customer engagement and stickiness and provides insights into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IT lifecycle.  During the fourth quarter, the CDW Amplified for Education team worked closely with Google and Internet2 team to make it easier for institutions to adopt Google Workspace for education plus. In addition to ease of procurement, with the Amplified IT team on board, we were able to deliver additional value to customers through much needed deep technical expertise and services, expertise and services that deliver organizational outcomes, enhance collaboration, streamlined instruction, and a secure learning environment.  This joint campaign generated more than 30 net new awards in the fourth quarter with more than $11 million in total contract value over the next several years. This is a great example of how we leverage our powerful business model to quickly deliver customer benefits from newly acquired capabilities. It is also a great example of how our acquisitions enhance our ability to deliver full outcomes across the full stack and the entire IT lifecycle.  Internal investments made in 2021 also enhanced our ability to deliver on this strategy. These included digital investments in proprietary portals to drive customer and seller productivity. We also added 1000 new coworkers in addition to the nearly 3,000 coworkers who joined us via acquisition. Just over half of all new coworkers in 2021 are in technical roles. Whether acquired or homegrown, investments in our three-part growth strategy are integral to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the US IT market.  That brings me to our thoughts about 2022. In 2022, we will continue to execute against our three-part strategy with a focus on the recent integrations. A top priority in this area is the disciplined integration of Sirius. Work is moving apace led by a dedicated seasoned executive.  The team's mission is, just as it's been with all of our acquisitions, to ensure our customers are able to quickly reap the benefits of our combination. And we are making excellent and swift progress in that area. For example, I'm pleased to share that our new Sirius coworkers had a CDW email address on day one, a seemingly small accomplishment, but with really big impact.  Turning to 2022 financial performance, our outlook is built off a combined 2021 CDW and Sirius net sales figure of $23 billion, which includes $2.2 billion of full-year Sirius results. Top line performance for Sirius was relatively flat compared to 2020 as they overcame a number of large projects and the impact of supply interruptions. Managed services, an area of focus for Sirius, delivered double-digit growth.  In 2022, as Sirius is integrated into the fabric of CDW, we expect its operations to grow in line with total CDW. Given current market dynamics, our 2022 baseline outlook calls for US IT market growth of 3.5%, plus 200 basis points to 300 basis points in constant currency of CDW outperformance.  This outlook reflects our view on three key drivers. First, we expect a moderation in US GDP growth. Second, we expect the impact of supply on our results in 2022 to remain fairly consistent with its impact at year-end 2021. And third, we expect customer priorities in 2022 will increasingly require integrated solutions that leverage our services, cloud and hybrid expertise. Wildcards remain ongoing supply and macro impacts, particularly in small business.  Of course, as we always do, we will update you on our thoughts as we move through the year. I'm extremely proud of the excellent financial performance and strategic progress we've made during the past two years.  In 2022, we will continue to do what we do best leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute the competition.  If the pandemic has shown us anything, it is that technology is essential to all sectors of our economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. That means our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. And I remain confident that we have the right strategy in place.  And with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al?\nAl Miralles : Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the fourth quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2022 outlook.  Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.5 billion, including one-month contribution from Sirius of $197 million. Consolidated net sales were up 11.7% on a reported basis and 9.9% on an average daily sales basis, as we add one extra selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales was 9.6%, including 3.9 points of contribution from Sirius.  Consistent with the last quarter, net sales in channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year \u2013 corporate, small business and international \u2013 continued to rebound, posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels. This quarter's growth also benefit from strong double-digit performance in health care that was tempered by the expected declines in government and education.  On the supply side, our overall backlog increased a few hundred million dollars in the quarter, reflecting constraints similar to last year. Backlog remained elevated year-over-year. We continue to make strategic investments in inventory, support our customers through this constrained supply environment, and the team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages, so the backlog did not increase even more.  Gross profit for the quarter was $976 million, an increase of 10.8% on a reported basis and resulted in a strong gross margin of 17.6%. Gross margin was positively impacted by the increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily software as a service, in addition to strong professional services performance. This was more than offset by lower product margin and overlapping high margin configurations in the prior year. Sirius' gross profit margin was consistent with their historical performance, and was modestly accretive to the overall gross margin for the quarter.  Turning to SG&A on slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. This reflected the impact of consolidating one month of incremental Sirius expenses. Sirius' sales compensation as a percentage of net sales was higher than our core operations, given the higher mix of solutions and services revenues. The overall increase also reflected higher performance-based compensation, consistent with higher attainment against financial goals and investments in the business, including increased coworker counts.  Coworker counts at the end of the quarter were 13,924, up 2,826 from the third quarter and 3,942 over prior year. Increasing coworker counts during the quarter reflects the addition of over 2,600 Sirius coworkers and other organic and inorganic coworker investments to support high growth solution areas and our own digital transformation.  GAAP operating income was $339 million, up 2.1%. Non-GAAP operating income which better reflects operating performance is $425 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%.  As we shared on last quarter's call, investments made in the fourth quarter drove an operating margin which delivered our full-year outlook. Sirius' non-GAAP operating margin was consistent with their historic performance and was marginally accretive for the quarter.  Moving to slide 10. Interest expense was $43 million, up 16.9%. The increase reflected the incremental expense on the $2.5 billion of notes issued in December to finance the Sirius acquisition. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 11 was 25.1%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs as shown on slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.5%, up 230 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to one-time tax benefits recognized in the prior year.  As you can see on slide 13, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 138 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.57, down 4.5%. Our non-GAAP net income was $285 million in the quarter, up 8.2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.08, up 14% from last year and reflects the impact of share repurchases.  Turning to full year results on slides 14 through 19. As Chris mentioned, 2021 performance reflected exceptional execution against an effective strategy along with the power of our business model and balanced portfolio.  Net sales were $20.8 billion, an increase of 12.7% on a reported basis and average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, full-year consolidated net sales grew 11.9%, including 110 basis point contribution from Sirius.  Gross profit was $3.6 billion, up 11.2%, and gross profit margin was 17.1%, down approximately 30 basis points year-over-year. In 2021, software and services accounted for approximately 41% of total gross profit, up 100 basis points from last year. The increase reflects investment in our services and solution capabilities and a continued shift into netted down revenues like software as a service.  Before moving down the rest of the full-year P&L, I want to take a moment to put netted down revenues into perspective. Netted down revenues results from software as a service, software assurance and warranty solutions as well as agent commission fees. We're not the primary obligor for these solutions, and thus record gross profit as our revenue and why you sometimes hear us refer to these as 100% gross margin items.  In the past, we shared examples of how this accounting treatment has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars, but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins all else equal. Over the last five years, our netted down revenue strength as a percentage of total gross revenues or customer spend has increased 10 percentage points. The greater mix reflects increased customer spend on fast growing netted down revenue streams, like cloud and security.  Long term, as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and invest in the capabilities necessary to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers, we expect a mix further in the high growth netted down revenue streams. This mix dynamics will pressure net sales while remaining neutral to gross profit and expanding gross margin. This, of course, is subject to hardware refresh cycles and other mix components of the business.  While much of what I've described is tied to the accounting treatment, it is also a reflection of our success in the execution of our strategy to capture share, enhance capabilities in high growth solution and expand services.  Returning to the full-year P&L. Operating income was $1.4 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.6 billion, up 17.1%. Net income was $989 million. Non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion, up 17.2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $7.97, up 20.9%.  Turning to the balance sheet on slide 20. On December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $258 million and net debt was $6.6 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.2 billion.  Moving to slide 21, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 24 days, up 7 days from last year's fourth quarter. In addition to our strategy of holding customer-driven stocking positions, the increase reflected mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles and the timing of customer receipts. This is partially offset by the timing of payments at the end of the year.  Full-year free cash flow was $477 million, as shown on slide 22. This is lighter than last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing, one-time items, and advantageous vendor payment terms. In 2021, our free cash flow was also impacted by increased working capital to support our strong full-year growth.  We also leveraged our strong balance sheet and distribution capabilities to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers in this unprecedented supply environment. As a result, 2021 free cash flow was below a rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. Timing differences, one-time items and noted investments resulted in asymmetrical free cash flows across 2020 and 2021. In aggregate, 2020 and 2021 free cash flows balanced out and equated to 4.3% of net sales, slightly above the high end of our free cash flow rule of thumb.  In 2021, we delivered on our capital allocation objectives and deployed more than $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $235 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to share repurchases at an average price of approximately $172 per share.  Turning to 2022 capital allocation priorities on slide 23. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target a dividend of approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings.  Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended this year at 3.4 times above our range due to the financing of the Sirius acquisition. We intend to optimize the use of cash flow after paying dividends to focus on reducing debt until we return to our net leverage range. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022.  As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases, and so net leverage is in our target range.  Moving to the outlook for 2022 on slide 24. As Chris mentioned, our outlook is built off the combined 2021 CDW and Sirius results, which presents these numbers as if we own Sirius at the start of 2021. Let me walk you through how this looks.  Starting with sales, given what we're seeing in the market now, our baseline outlook assumes US market growth 3.5%. We currently expect combined net sales to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. On a combined basis. CDW's net sales would have been $22.9 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius. We expect Sirius to grow in line with total CDW. Right now, 2022 feels like a normal demand environment and expect it will reflect a greater mix in the netted down revenues as we overlap strong client device sales. Our baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we've been experiencing. We would expect it to be to be at the lower end of our premium range if we've mixed more into netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experienced elevated levels of supply constraints. We would be at the higher end if hardware growth is strong and supply improves.  Currency is expected to be neutral for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.37 to the British pound and $0.80 to the Canadian dollar.  Moving down the P&L, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. Our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $8.49 in 2021 on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97, which included one month of Sirius. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow high-single digits in 2022, call it 9.25%, plus or minus 50 basis points in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to approximately 16% to 17% growth in constant currency on a reported basis.  As Chris mentioned, the integration work with Sirius is progressing. And given the nature of the integrated sales, we will not be breaking out Sirius results going forward. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our combined financial outlook on an annual constant currency basis.  Slide 24 provides our expected net sales split for the year. We expect net sales in the first half of the year to be in line with our historic norm of 48% to 49%. Sirius' sales split is slightly higher in the second half than historic CDW. Historically, we see a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1.  This year, on a reported basis, we expect first quarter sequential growth in the low-single digits, reflecting three months of contribution from Sirius versus one month in Q4. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth relative to Q1 2021 to be in the low mid-teens, reflecting seasonality and channel mix.  Modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can also be found on slide 25.  In addition, you can see our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. We expect CapEx to run approximately 70 basis points to 75 basis points as a percentage of net sales, reflecting our continued view that now is the time to continue to accelerate investment in our own digital transformation, enabling us to further fortify our competitive position, make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers, and vendor partners.  That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macroenvironment and our business on future earnings calls.  And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. And can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Amit, please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: My first question is really around this EPS guide for 2022. I think you talked about 16%, 17% EPS growth for 2022. Can you just talk about what are you really assuming out of the Sirius acquisition in that EPS number? And really, the two parts I'd love to kind of get some clarity on is, a, do you have any cost synergies from the transactions embedded in that number? And then secondly, Chris, I'd love to understand how you think about the scaled synergies narrative from Sirius as we go forward?\nAl Miralles: So just a couple of things to note. So, I think we've given you some component parts to get a sense for EPS. So number one, obviously, our reported EPS for 2021 was $7.97. That includes one month of contribution for Sirius. We've also provided you what would be a combined CDW and Sirius result for 2021 as if they were together for the full year. That's $8.49. So, the way you should think about it is if you walk forward from that $8.49 to our outlook there of 9.25% growth, you get a sense for the combined entities and what they contribute.  The other data point I would just give you is that we noted that, from a top line perspective, we'd expect that Sirius would grow at the same rate as we provided in that top line outlook.  To your question on synergies. So, here's what I would say. Look, we're very focused on the integration of the combined entities. And we expect through that, we're going to find value in terms of synergies on the revenue front. We're certainly looking hard at procurement efficiencies, systems consolidations, facilities consolidation, all of those components, and we expect we're going to get value.  But, Amit, I would just mention that it's critically important as we talk about our strategy that we continue to invest in our strategy. And I would say as it pertains to synergies, reinvest. And so, while we expect we're going to see value, we expect that a lot of those values we get from the synergy be reinvested in 2022. \nAmit Daryanani: As I think about the balance between transactional versus solution, how do you think that stacks up in calendar 2022? And do you think the supply environment maybe starts getting worse at least through 2022? How do you kind of think of that narrative? I would love to get a sense of the mix and then supply environment? \nAl Miralles: Look, I would say, comments on the supply environment, Q4 looked very similar to the prior quarters in terms of the supply environment. Our backlog increased consistent with those previous quarters, call it a couple hundred million of backlog increase.  Look, there are some puts and takes in terms of what supply chain would look like in Q4 and I would say probably a bit more challenged on the solution side of the business. And I think that's natural as these efforts evolve over time. As we look forward into 2022, we don't really see any meaningful end in sight. I would say, as we think about kind of our interactions and what we hear and observe from a partner and product perspective, maybe there's silver lining there that some of the transparency has improved. So, there's a better line of sight of lead times and where things stand, but I'm not sure that we would translate that into any indication of things are going to get better in the near term. And so, really, we're hunkered down on consistent similar outlook with respect to this supply chain environment and we'll continue to execute as we have during this time. \nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. \nAdam Tindle: Al, I just wanted to start on 2022 guidance. And the revenue buildup implies around 6% growth for the full year, but looks like you're going to be starting at about half that level based on the Q1 guidance. And as we think about compares getting tougher as the year progresses, there's questions around how long the device ecosystem tailwinds are going to last as the year progresses. Maybe you can double click on those fears and why you have built in acceleration in year-over-year growth as the year progresses to start with? Thanks.\nAl Miralles: I think you hit a lot of the right points. So, look, on the full year, we're confident in our growth expectations. There certainly is a timing and effect. And there are a few puts and takes in that regard. So, number one, in terms of sequentially from Q4 to Q1, we've got the positive that we'll have three months of contribution from Sirius. So that certainly helps from a top line perspective.  You will recall we have some tough comps, otherwise, and particularly in education, with Q1, so that has a bit of an offsetting effect. So, when we add up that, along with our typical seasonality, we would be back to kind of our 48/52 split in terms of seasonality.  Now, look, there's the wildcards. And those wildcards include what type of product throughput are we seeing and will it be more hardware focused versus services and solution? And I would just say the obvious wildcard is supply and that will certainly change the shape and direction of timing by quarter. \nAdam Tindle: Maybe just as a follow-up, you onboarded over 2,500 employees from Sirius and I just had a question on integration, Chris. You talked about the CDW culture, how it permeates customer-facing coworkers, compensation metrics are generally aligned with key metrics like gross profit dollar growth and returns on capital. As you think about the Sirius employees that you're taking on, maybe you can touch on their comp metrics and any potential planned changes to that. And, Al, if you could touch on the systems integration piece of this, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Integration is going really quite well. And it's I'd say moving with smart speed. We're very disciplined as you know, but we also understand moving with the appropriate amount of speed to make sure that our customers are benefiting from the combined organizations is critically important.  You also know the lens that we look through when we assess potential acquisitions and culture is right up there on the list. It is so important to us. And the Sirius coworkers, now CDW coworkers are fully aligned with our culture, customer-first, coworker-first and collaborative, I would say, and we're already seeing benefits of us coming together, winning deals together, going to meet customers together.  In terms of the comp schemes, this is what I will tell you, Adam. They're similarly performance-based with similar metrics. From an integration perspective, we are taking the 2022 year very methodically because we, of course, want to get compensation right. But from a cost and incentive lens, very similar to CDW. And again, the teams are already coming together collaborating with each other on deals, sending referrals across to each other. And I'm really pleased with how it's going.\nAl Miralles: I'll just add a couple of things. So number one, just from a compensation perspective, Chris hit the key points there in terms of alignment. Just keep in mind, because their business has a higher proportion of services solutions, that variable fixed component of the business looks a little different. They have a higher cost to serve with their technical staff. And so, that will shift. I don't think that's a diametrical shift immediately. We'll see that over time as we integrate.  On your question on systems consolidation, look, it's a little early days. I think we've laid down the foundation of kind of the initial evaluation of systems. And I think we're pleased to see that there's really strong infrastructure from a Sirius perspective. And so, we're really lining up for an approach of best in breed from a systems perspective, and we think there's going to be opportunities to take on some of the technology tools they have, as well as vice versa. So, we'll share more as we have that, but we're making good progress on that front. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Sheerin from Stifel.\nMatthew Sheerin: Chris, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on your outlook for the year in terms of end market. What should we be thinking about on the commercial side of the business, which has been accelerating, versus the public sector, which you've talked about, tough comps in education and government? \nChristine Leahy: As we look at 2022, let me try to simplify by segment. What we've seen in the commercial space, both corporate and small business, has been, I would say, very positive signs of recovery. And our expectations are for continued solid growth, but at a decelerated rate from 2021.  We talked about education and the unseasonality there. The one thing I would say about education, the emergency connectivity funds availability goes through the middle of the summer, so the end of Q2. So, we're going to see, one would expect, some nice uplift there. But then growth will be a little muted for the rest of the year. Higher ed, doing great work in higher ed and expect to continue to see solid growth throughout the year.  Health care, I would tell you, is recovering very nicely. And we would expect it to recover above the 2019 levels, if we go back two years. So solid growth there.  Government, we are not changing our expectation that we're going to expect to see turnaround there in the federal space and in state and local, frankly, as we see funds start to flow a little bit more into the state and local, but certainly going to see a return to growth in government in our view.  And then international, that'll continue to be solid again, but at a decelerated rate. Very similar to what I said about the commercial space. Now, of course, the key wildcards are supply. And that obviously can be a plus or a minus. And then, the macroenvironment and what we see happen both with the virus, but equally inflation, employment and all of that. But right now, we feel like there's very good momentum going into the year. There's strong demand and we're feeling very positive about where we're positioned to meet that demand.\nMatthew Sheerin: Just regarding your commentary just about the product and component constraints, we're hearing from other resellers that some customers are moving or accelerating the move toward off-prem, cloud-based computing storage, et cetera, because of those constraints. Are you seeing that at all from your customers? \nChristine Leahy: Not what I would say is \u2013 it's part of the conversation. And we are seeing acceleration to the cloud. But we've said this before, our clients are being very thoughtful about the strategy and what technology best serves their organizational needs. Whether it is agility, whether it is risk mitigation, cloud versus on-prem. So we are certainly having the conversations. And the great news is, with the breadth of our expertise, our customers are really appreciating that we can sit down and explore all options with them. That's really unique in the marketplace. But they're making the decisions, I would say, with the right amount of discipline, and not just wholesale lift and shift because they can't get the product. They are being patient. Frustrated, but patient.  So, I think that's the way I'd answer the question. Certainly, acceleration to the cloud, but thoughtful as they go and on-prem is also \u2013 I think we're going to see some strength in on-prem this year as customers return to the office and infrastructure refresh continues to happen.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: I wanted to ask a couple of more questions on the revenue growth guide for both the fiscal 2022 as well as for the first quarter. Al, is there a way to quantify what you've baked in in terms of headwind from supply shortages in the full-year guide, so either on a dollar basis or on a year-over-year growth headwind basis? And are you assuming that PC demand sustains throughout the full year?\nAl Miralles: Let me start with that. And Chris may have something to add there. So, we are assuming no change in the supply environment relative to what we experienced in 2021. So, just recall, if look back the last three quarters, we've quoted that our backlog has increased several hundred million dollars through 2021. That's notwithstanding that written demand continue to be extremely strong. So, if you look at our actual printed results, there are times we look at it and say, you can't really see the effect of the significant backlog. So, I think our expectation would be that supply chain will continue to work as it has. And I think you may have some pluses and minuses through that in terms of solutions versus transactions and byproducts. But lo and behold, I think that supply assumptions are very consistent with what we've seen in 2021. \nRuplu Bhattacharya: And on PC demand, any thoughts on how that sustains throughout the year? \nChristine Leahy: On PC demand, look, I think we will see Q1 is going to be a tough quarter because of the overlaps, for sure. And as we move through the year, we expect to continue to see corporate, commercial, small business, international, continued strength there, provided that the recovery that we're seeing continues and provided the macroenvironment continues.  When you think about the puts and takes across 2022, supply can be a plus or minus. I mentioned the emergency connectivity funds for K-12. That'll be a plus. Macro can be a plus or a minus. But generally speaking, here's what I'd say about PCs and it's consistent with our commentary of the past. We really do see client devices as a tool for employees, as a tool for people generally and expectations of using them for productivity have increased. And the demand for client devices for remote and then as people frankly come back to the office and are working in the office and remotely and anywhere, also add demand to the market.  The other thing we've talked about is technology cycles and technology innovation and upgrades happening more quickly than we've typically seen in the past. And when you think about remote and virtual, think about breakage. And so, you've got a couple of pressure points putting cycle times \u2013 compressing cycle times. The last thing I would say is new use cases. We continue to see endpoint devices and new use cases in the digital transformation. So, I guess, think about PCs this year as still solid performance, moderating growth especially compared to last year. And by the time we get to the end of the year, when you look at where we are, and you think about the refresh opportunities from 2017 and 2018, those are going to be opening up and then we've got Win 10 end of life coming. So, people are buying PCs, we are in a very good position to make sure that we get our fair share of inventory to supply them. And while we see moderating growth, we just see it as a positive contribution to our overall performance.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Can I just ask a follow-up on the first quarter revenue guide? I think you're guiding low-single digit year-on-year growth. To me, it seems a little bit lower than normal seasonality on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And that's with the fact that you have the Sirius acquisition layered in as well for three months. So, how much of that would you say is because you have more netted down items, which are impacting the sales growth versus other year-on-year headwinds. So, any way to quantify that sequential decline in revenues on a daily basis between 4Q and 1Q?\nAl Miralles: Let me address it. So, first, just on a year-over-year basis, the growth is not muted. It's in the teens in terms of growth. I think just on the \u2013 comment on the sequential is the one obviously coming off of a very strong Q4, but the comps for education, much more significant in Q1 relative to Q4 there, and so that mutes the impact. You get a bit of a kind of contra going the other way with, again, Sirius, but there's some of the puts and takes. If you just focus on that year-over-year, that was very strong. \nChristine Leahy: It's Chris here. I would just add that, as we think about 2022 and 2021, generally, I think we would call 2022 a more normalized, I'll call it, buying environment. We had tremendous hardware sales in 2021 and client demand. And we've said that \u2013 and our strategy is around building our services and cloud capabilities. And we do expect that 2022 is going to require additional services and cloud capabilities, which net down. So, I think we'll see more normalized netting down for 2022.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Just given your commentary around supply chain headwinds. Just curious to get your take on how you think inventory will trend in 2022. And if you need to continue kind of growing your strategic pre purchases or if that can become a tailwind for you in 2022. And then I have a follow up. \nAl Miralles: First, again, just [Technical Difficulty], supply chain would look similar to 2021. I think we've mentioned before, there is a component of backlog in supply chain, and includes pull forward of business. And I think as our partners became more and more clued into and kind of have gotten clarity of lead times and so forth, they've encouraged us and encouraged customers to get in line. And I think through 2021, that has happened. And we would expect that will continue to happen. In terms of how that plays out and what that might look like, I think that now \u2013 I think we could look at our backlog and say we've got a pretty balanced portfolio there of pull forward business as well as current business. And so, for those very reasons, we don't believe that the backlog will ultimately result or play out as a full flush or a big bang, if you will. It's going to feather in over time. So, I think it's going to be probably a bit episodic in terms of continue to progress from individual partners and products in terms of how that plays out and how fast it moves. But again, as we sit here now, we would say we would not expect that to be anything that happens near term. And our hope is that, later 2022, we start to see that feather out. \nErik Woodring: Maybe just a quick look back, organic growth of, call it, 8 points in 4Q. It was pretty strong and ahead of, I think, what your annual guidance sort of implied. So, just as you look across segments, maybe some commentary on where you believe you've outperformed your expectations versus three months ago. And then maybe is that a product of share gains? Is that product of stronger market growth, just anyway to decipher some of the outperformance in 4Q? \nChristine Leahy: As we look at Q4 and the strength across the segments, the nice thing is it was balanced across transactions and solutions. And I do think \u2013 I'm not going to go back into supply chain, but I do think supply chain ended up impacting growth on some categories across each.  But that said, look, I think in every element, whether it was client devices or infrastructure or cloud, I feel confident that the team has really been outperforming the market in a very balanced way. When you think about the acquisitions we've made and our ability to integrate them very quickly into the organization as practice groups and as part of the larger CDW, areas like security in Focal Point and what we bring to market there and the speed that we're growing there or our Digital Velocity practice and our ServiceNow automation practice and how that is flowing into 54% growth in our services category. So, I feel very good that we are outperforming taking share, and in particular, in those high growth areas where we are investing. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. \nJim Suva: I only have one question. It's probably directed towards Chris. In your prepared comments, you talked about, in 2020, a big strength year in K-12. And then, in 2021, more of a pivot to enterprise. So, Chris, I'm just kind of asking, as you look into, say, 2022, the end markets, what strength \u2013 or maybe is it cloud? Is it services or type of products that you see maybe being stronger in, say, 2022 versus 2021? \nChristine Leahy: Customers are still \u2013 across all of the segments, customers are still prioritizing, whether it's remote, work from home, learn from home, just remote work, work from anywhere, and virtual settings. So, solutions that address those needs are going to continue to drive a solid performance. At the same time, I think the pandemic is really likely going to impact our customers in a slightly different way as we think about 2022 because we're all more prepared to deal with it. So, we are seeing customers absolutely pivot or enhance their investment portfolio and focus on infrastructure, both on-prem refresh, on-prem new technology, particularly software driven, as well as cloud options, to drive resiliency, to drive agility, to drive securing platforms and endpoint devices.  So, 2022, as we think about the products, what we're seeing from customers suggests a very balanced year across the portfolio. That's really how I describe it going into 2022. \nOperator: The next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Chris, can you talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers in terms of their willingness to absorb price increases? Just sort of in general, what you're hearing with relation to the inflationary environment because, obviously, that's going to be something key to the industry, frankly, being able to offset some of the other pressures.\nChristine Leahy: Here's what I am hearing. Nobody likes price increases, but virtually all commercial customers, technology is the number one investment. People and technology. So, if there's a budget to spend, they're not cutting back on budgets at all. In fact, they might be expanding them. But having to be very disciplined about cost containment. So, again, our expertise across the full spectrum allows us, with our customers, to have conversations that can drive cost reduction, cost management in a way that makes us even more valuable. But we're not finding commercial customers or other customers, for that matter, who are reducing technology investments at all. So, that's the good news. And again, technology is essential to being competitive, to winning, to educating, to doing all the things that companies are trying to do and organizations are trying to do. So, we're not seeing any material impact at this point. And, obviously, we're passing prices along.  Al, I don't know if you'd add anything. \nAl Miralles: Yeah, just a couple of comments, Shannon. So, obviously, ASPs have varied quite a bit by product. And it is partially a function of availability and just supply chain environment. I would say that, in pockets, customers are getting more creative. They're willing to accept substitutes in terms of different products, and they're willing to kind of think about solutions in different ways. And that's certainly helped to free up some capacity. I'd say our partners have done an exceptional job doing the same. So there definitely is price pressure. I would say that largely customers are getting through that. Written demand continues to be extremely strong. Written  And then, just for us, right, our job is and what we're focused on is how do we serve our customers best and bring in the best solutions. And as it pertains to financial impacts, obviously, I think we've done a really nice job, making sure that we can pass through these price increases where they happen and insulate ourselves from a gross profit perspective. \nShannon Cross: You've guided to low 8% for operating margin, which, obviously, is higher than you've done in the past. Is that absolutely all from the acquisition? Or are there any mix issues or benefits actually we should take into account as we think about the core business? And then, again, I know you talked a little bit about synergies, but I'm just kind of curious if you could bucket what's really driving the margin improvement? \nAl Miralles: First, notwithstanding Sirius, we would expect that we would have made progress on our gross margins and our NGOI margins. You add Sirius and that's obviously accretive as well. And we actually think the power of the organizations coming together, that's going to make that really meaningful.  Just keep in mind, so we are providing outlook to that low 8, and it's the combination of that inorganic and organic. Just keep in mind, there are wildcards, right, that will be influenced by things like supply chain, it will be influenced by how much the business is transactional versus solutions. But again, as we sit here today, we feel really good about our prospects to continue to make progress on our margins.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess a couple of quick ones for Al, really. I think if I go back to the time that you announced the Sirius acquisition, the pro forma gross profit margin was expected to do 18.5%. So, I was just looking if you can give me some color on how gross margin strength through 2022 and how should I think about the exit rate for the gross margins relative to the pro forma number that you had talked about? \nAl Miralles: Yes, really pointing back to what we've provided on the investor meeting for Sirius, we noted that their gross margins are higher than ours. And so, we would certainly expect that that accretive effect is going to come through. And again, in addition to our progress, otherwise. Now, look, we don't provide outlook. So I'm not going to quote for you specifically what our gross margins would be. But I think if you apply the math on where we're coming out, from an NGOI margin outlook perspective, you get a good sense of the progress we expect we're going to make.\nSamik Chatterjee: Follow up on Sirius again, which is \u2013 I think you talked about flat revenue in 2021. You're expecting growth in 2022 to look more in line with the rest of CDW. And you talked about reinvestments in that business as well. So, how should we think about this? Is this more of a reinvestment into accelerating growth in Sirius, which would then contribute more towards your content outperformance relative to the industry? Is that the purpose of driving the reinvestment? How should we think about acceleration in the growth from here on? \nChristine Leahy: Let me start with that one. I think as a starting place, a reminder that with Sirius, we are actively and swiftly bringing them together. So, when you think of some of the other acquisitions we've recently done, they've really been practice areas that can tuck into our technology groups in a holistic way. Sirius, we are going to bring the organization into CDW and literally integrate it. So, as we think about growth in the future, when we say we expect Sirius to drive, at least 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market, what we mean is we expect the teams to perform as CDW has always performed with the benefit of our competitive advantages and outperforming the market. So, we think about it on a combined basis as opposed to a standalone Sirius contribution. \nAl Miralles: And maybe just one thing I would add there in terms of your comments about value we add and the synergies. So, look, I think we've talked about the more immediate impacts that can be made from an accretive perspective on margin. And we do fully believe that putting the combined entities together will be powerful and will lead to value. Look, if we think long run, certainly short run, that's going to provide benefits. And we think long run, taking those synergies and those values and saying let's continue to put them back into the business, from a long run perspective, that's where the real upside is. So, we think that 2022 will show great progress in terms of our accretion on margin on our progress, on our strategy and those investments and reinvestments will further reinforce that build for the future.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: In terms of the price increases in the industry, I guess I was hoping a little bit color in terms of how you guys are thinking about how price increases are impacting, I guess, the US GDP growth that you guys expect, as well as the contribution to your top line? \nAl Miralles: Look, I don't know if I have one single answer in terms of the impact. I will say that and reiterate the written demand continues to be super strong. So, as we think about the growth of prices, which have been meaningful in different pockets across our product set, it has not stopped demand. And I think that is, like Chris said, a testament to the power of technology and the importance of technology and the fact that our vast customer base is looking to go forward and continuing to invest in their own efforts in digital transformation. And so, really, if you look from a top line perspective, in terms of revenue, we don't think it's had a meaningful impact. [indiscernible] demand is definitely still there. And our belief is that will largely continue. \nKeith Housum: I guess the point I'm trying to unpack a little bit further is that it's consistent across a lot of the people that we've talked to, there's a lot of demand out there, prices have increased, but yet it seems like US IT forecasts are in the 3.5% and 5.5% growth. I'm just kind of questioning why the number is not perhaps higher. \nChristine Leahy: Well, let me just add. We will, obviously, as we always do, update as we go through the course of the year, but right now, what we're seeing is a moderation in estimates for GDP. Inflationary trends, uncertain where those will be. And the wildcards in the macro environment, labor shortages, et cetera, I think you're hearing people at the beginning of the year taking a clear eyed view of what to expect in 2020. Look, ASPs could drive it up, but we'll know more as we start to move through the year on all of these things.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I'll pass the conference over to Chris Leahy, CEO and President. Chris, please go ahead.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you, Bailey. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the absolute privilege and opportunity to serve you.  To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes the CDW fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll begin our call with an overview of our full year and fourth quarter performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2022. Then I'll hand the call over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions.  2021 was a year of both strong financial performance and strategic progress. The teams delivered $21 billion in net sales with excellent profitability. Margins improved and our 13% increase in sales translated to a 17% increase in both non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases amplified this growth and non GAAP net income per share increased 21% to $7.97.  These exceptional results demonstrate the power of our resilient business model, a model that has enabled us to deliver industry-leading performance year after year, including through the past two years of a global health crisis, unprecedented supply interruptions and evolving customer priorities.  You see the power of our model and the performance across our balanced portfolio of customer end markets over the past two years. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels:\u2013 corporate; small business; health care; government, which includes federal and state and local customers; and education with K-12 and higher ed.  We also have our UK and Canadian operations each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own right. Often different factors impact customer end markets, sometimes macro and sometimes industry specific. This was the case over the past two years as customers across our diverse end markets experienced the impact of the pandemic very differently.  In 2020, public customer spend, fueled by education and government, offset commercial and international declines and net sales increased 2%. In 2021, our 13% sales increase was powered by strong commercial and international customer spend, which more than offset flat public sales.  The past two years also highlighted the power of our business model in our product and solutions performance, with more than 100,000 products and solutions from over 1,000 leading and emerging brands. We are well positioned to meet our customers' needs, whether transactional or highly complex.  In 2020, customers prioritized remote enablement and continuity. Transactions increased driven by the ability to deliver endpoint solutions to meet unprecedented work from home and learn from home needs. At the same time, solutions declined as customers focus their spend on addressing critical endpoint projects. In 2021, while work from home and learn from home enablement remained key priorities, customers reprioritized investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure, platforms and endpoints. Both transactions and solutions increased.  Our ability to help customers address their priorities during two years of unprecedented supply challenge is another example of the power of our business model. We leveraged our competitive advantages, our distribution centers, our extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the environment. And our sellers and technical coworkers helped customers find alternative solutions from our deep portfolio whenever possible.  In 2020, we were able to deliver more than 11 million client devices despite meaningful supply shortages in endpoint devices. In 2021, while facing extended lead times for transactions and solutions, we delivered solid growth in both categories.  As you can see, our resilient business model had a significant impact on our ability to profitably grow during an unprecedented period. Looking at performance over the past two years, net sales are up 15% since 2019 and our annual net sales compound growth rate was 7.5%. Profitability improved at a faster rate with compound annual growth rates for gross profit and non-GAAP operating income of 8% and 10%, respectively.  Of course, our business model is not the only component of our formula to profitably outgrow the U.S. market. Our success would not be possible without the dedication of our talented team of 14,000 coworkers, including the more than 2,600 new Sirius coworkers who joined us in December. During the past two years, time and again, CDW coworkers demonstrated why they are so vital to our ability to successfully deliver industry-leading performance year after year.  Let's take a closer look at what the teams delivered for the fourth quarter. For the quarter, net sales were $5.5 billion, including $197 million of results from Sirius, which closed on December 1. On an average daily sales and constant currency basis, net sales increased 9.6%.  Non-GAAP net income was $285 million in the quarter, up 8.2%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.08, up 14% from last year. The teams leveraged the combination of our broad and deep portfolio, extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate full outcomes to address customers' priorities across all of our customer end markets. Outcomes that deliver five key organizational benefits \u2013 innovation, lower cost, agility, risk mitigation and enhanced experiences for customers and coworkers.  Let's take a look. Corporate delivered a 33% increase with excellent performance across both transactions and solutions. Digital transformation, agility and security remained top priorities. Endpoint solutions remained a key focus area and the team delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth in client devices. Small business delivered another exceptional quarter, up 31%, with strong growth across both transactions and solutions. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement. Security performance was up mid-teens as the team helped customers address risk mitigation needs, delivering penetration testing and incident response as well as backup and recovery solutions.  On the public side of the business, excellent performance in both healthcare and higher ed was not enough to offset expected declines in government and K-12, and total public net sales declined to 13%. Healthcare's 20% increase continued to reflect return to projects that had been put on hold.  Security remained a top priority. Cloud adoption was strong, in part driven by efficiency needs as customers dealt with COVID-19 and acute care. The expected decline in federal reflected the lumpy nature of government contracts as the teams faced two meaningful overlaps in the fourth quarter of 2020, the wind down of our devices and service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and a large client device program. Results also reflected the impact of slowness in contracting practices we shared last quarter. We are beginning to see greenshoots and there's no change to our expectation that trends will reverse later in 2022.  State and local posted a high-single digit decline. The team delivered a high-single digit increase in solutions, driven by helping customers upgrade security. This could not overcome the team's 2020 strong fourth quarter performance when they helped customers take advantage of the year-end use-it-or-lose-it CARE funds. As we shared last quarter, we continue to help our customers work through the planning required to evaluate multiple funding opportunities and multi-year phasing and expect funded projects to begin implementation as we move through 2022.  Higher ed strong double-digit performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12, and overall education sales increased 9% on top of 2020 fourth quarter remarkable 142% growth. Higher ed growth reflected our ability to meet growing demand for student success programs. These programs use technology to give institutions an edge, including comprehensive endpoint solutions, improved security, campus connectivity as well as enhancing the dorm room experience.  The K-12 team delivered excellent net sales performance against very tough unseasonal fourth quarter 2022 compares. Consistent with expectations we've previously shared, net sales declined. Although down year over year, fourth quarter client device sales were more than double a typical pre-COVID fourth quarter.  Both the UK and Canada delivered high teens local market growth. Combined in our other results, average daily sales for these two markets increased 20% in US dollars. Customer priorities in both markets were similar to those in the US.  Our success addressing customer priorities is evident in our fourth quarter portfolio performance where we delivered balanced growth across transactions and solutions both increasing mid-single digits.  On the transaction side, client devices increased mid-single digits. While client device supply improved in some areas and we were able to help more customers adopt alternative providers, overall supply remained constrained and we exited the year with an elevated backlog. Tight supply continued to impact prices which our teams were generally able to pass along. Video and audio delivered another impressive quarter.  Solutions growth was driven by strong software and servers performance. Writings remain strong as customers turn to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and entire lifecycle. Lead times extended in several key solutions areas, notably netcom, enterprise storage and servers. Remaining solutions orders increased at year-end.  Once again, the team delivered strong double-digit growth in cloud, driven by robust growth in security, infrastructure as a service, and productivity. Security cloud growth was driven by the success of our comprehensive strategy of security assessments, data protection and threat mitigation with many solutions delivered via cloud and software. Overall security spend in the quarter increased mid-teens.  Our ability to meet customer needs in the quarter across the IT continuum translated into a mid-single digit US hardware sales, 20% increase in software and more than 50% increase in services. Services growth reflected the ongoing success of our strategy and was balanced across professional and managed services. Recent acquisitions are paying off, contributing meaningfully to this quarter's growth.  So, as you can see, our fourth quarter delivered a strong finish to an excellent year of financial performance. 2021 was also a year of excellent strategic progress against our three-part strategy for growth, which is to first acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, extend our services capabilities. In 2021, we made excellent progress against all three of these pillars. Acquisitions made during the year, Focal Point, Amplified IT and Sirius, as well as integration progress for our 2020 acquisitions at IGNW and Aptris furthered our strategy to bolster our services capabilities.  Deep services capabilities are critical to our ability to deliver full organizational outcomes across the full stack and the entire lifecycle. This is an important source of differentiation in the marketplace.  Let me share a quick example of how this is showing up in our performance. Our acquisition of Amplified IT in August deepened our already strong offering in the education space, particularly in the Google ecosystem, which is the largest education platform in the US.  Amplified IT's expertise as a systems integrator enables us to facilitate end-to-end solutions for education customers. This leads to greater customer engagement and stickiness and provides insights into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IT lifecycle.  During the fourth quarter, the CDW Amplified for Education team worked closely with Google and Internet2 team to make it easier for institutions to adopt Google Workspace for education plus. In addition to ease of procurement, with the Amplified IT team on board, we were able to deliver additional value to customers through much needed deep technical expertise and services, expertise and services that deliver organizational outcomes, enhance collaboration, streamlined instruction, and a secure learning environment.  This joint campaign generated more than 30 net new awards in the fourth quarter with more than $11 million in total contract value over the next several years. This is a great example of how we leverage our powerful business model to quickly deliver customer benefits from newly acquired capabilities. It is also a great example of how our acquisitions enhance our ability to deliver full outcomes across the full stack and the entire IT lifecycle.  Internal investments made in 2021 also enhanced our ability to deliver on this strategy. These included digital investments in proprietary portals to drive customer and seller productivity. We also added 1000 new coworkers in addition to the nearly 3,000 coworkers who joined us via acquisition. Just over half of all new coworkers in 2021 are in technical roles. Whether acquired or homegrown, investments in our three-part growth strategy are integral to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the US IT market.  That brings me to our thoughts about 2022. In 2022, we will continue to execute against our three-part strategy with a focus on the recent integrations. A top priority in this area is the disciplined integration of Sirius. Work is moving apace led by a dedicated seasoned executive.  The team's mission is, just as it's been with all of our acquisitions, to ensure our customers are able to quickly reap the benefits of our combination. And we are making excellent and swift progress in that area. For example, I'm pleased to share that our new Sirius coworkers had a CDW email address on day one, a seemingly small accomplishment, but with really big impact.  Turning to 2022 financial performance, our outlook is built off a combined 2021 CDW and Sirius net sales figure of $23 billion, which includes $2.2 billion of full-year Sirius results. Top line performance for Sirius was relatively flat compared to 2020 as they overcame a number of large projects and the impact of supply interruptions. Managed services, an area of focus for Sirius, delivered double-digit growth.  In 2022, as Sirius is integrated into the fabric of CDW, we expect its operations to grow in line with total CDW. Given current market dynamics, our 2022 baseline outlook calls for US IT market growth of 3.5%, plus 200 basis points to 300 basis points in constant currency of CDW outperformance.  This outlook reflects our view on three key drivers. First, we expect a moderation in US GDP growth. Second, we expect the impact of supply on our results in 2022 to remain fairly consistent with its impact at year-end 2021. And third, we expect customer priorities in 2022 will increasingly require integrated solutions that leverage our services, cloud and hybrid expertise. Wildcards remain ongoing supply and macro impacts, particularly in small business.  Of course, as we always do, we will update you on our thoughts as we move through the year. I'm extremely proud of the excellent financial performance and strategic progress we've made during the past two years.  In 2022, we will continue to do what we do best leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute the competition.  If the pandemic has shown us anything, it is that technology is essential to all sectors of our economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. That means our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. And I remain confident that we have the right strategy in place.  And with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al? Integration is going really quite well. And it's I'd say moving with smart speed. We're very disciplined as you know, but we also understand moving with the appropriate amount of speed to make sure that our customers are benefiting from the combined organizations is critically important.  You also know the lens that we look through when we assess potential acquisitions and culture is right up there on the list. It is so important to us. And the Sirius coworkers, now CDW coworkers are fully aligned with our culture, customer-first, coworker-first and collaborative, I would say, and we're already seeing benefits of us coming together, winning deals together, going to meet customers together.  In terms of the comp schemes, this is what I will tell you, Adam. They're similarly performance-based with similar metrics. From an integration perspective, we are taking the 2022 year very methodically because we, of course, want to get compensation right. But from a cost and incentive lens, very similar to CDW. And again, the teams are already coming together collaborating with each other on deals, sending referrals across to each other. And I'm really pleased with how it's going. As we look at 2022, let me try to simplify by segment. What we've seen in the commercial space, both corporate and small business, has been, I would say, very positive signs of recovery. And our expectations are for continued solid growth, but at a decelerated rate from 2021.  We talked about education and the unseasonality there. The one thing I would say about education, the emergency connectivity funds availability goes through the middle of the summer, so the end of Q2. So, we're going to see, one would expect, some nice uplift there. But then growth will be a little muted for the rest of the year. Higher ed, doing great work in higher ed and expect to continue to see solid growth throughout the year.  Health care, I would tell you, is recovering very nicely. And we would expect it to recover above the 2019 levels, if we go back two years. So solid growth there.  Government, we are not changing our expectation that we're going to expect to see turnaround there in the federal space and in state and local, frankly, as we see funds start to flow a little bit more into the state and local, but certainly going to see a return to growth in government in our view.  And then international, that'll continue to be solid again, but at a decelerated rate. Very similar to what I said about the commercial space. Now, of course, the key wildcards are supply. And that obviously can be a plus or a minus. And then, the macroenvironment and what we see happen both with the virus, but equally inflation, employment and all of that. But right now, we feel like there's very good momentum going into the year. There's strong demand and we're feeling very positive about where we're positioned to meet that demand. Not what I would say is \u2013 it's part of the conversation. And we are seeing acceleration to the cloud. But we've said this before, our clients are being very thoughtful about the strategy and what technology best serves their organizational needs. Whether it is agility, whether it is risk mitigation, cloud versus on-prem. So we are certainly having the conversations. And the great news is, with the breadth of our expertise, our customers are really appreciating that we can sit down and explore all options with them. That's really unique in the marketplace. But they're making the decisions, I would say, with the right amount of discipline, and not just wholesale lift and shift because they can't get the product. They are being patient. Frustrated, but patient.  So, I think that's the way I'd answer the question. Certainly, acceleration to the cloud, but thoughtful as they go and on-prem is also \u2013 I think we're going to see some strength in on-prem this year as customers return to the office and infrastructure refresh continues to happen. On PC demand, look, I think we will see Q1 is going to be a tough quarter because of the overlaps, for sure. And as we move through the year, we expect to continue to see corporate, commercial, small business, international, continued strength there, provided that the recovery that we're seeing continues and provided the macroenvironment continues.  When you think about the puts and takes across 2022, supply can be a plus or minus. I mentioned the emergency connectivity funds for K-12. That'll be a plus. Macro can be a plus or a minus. But generally speaking, here's what I'd say about PCs and it's consistent with our commentary of the past. We really do see client devices as a tool for employees, as a tool for people generally and expectations of using them for productivity have increased. And the demand for client devices for remote and then as people frankly come back to the office and are working in the office and remotely and anywhere, also add demand to the market.  The other thing we've talked about is technology cycles and technology innovation and upgrades happening more quickly than we've typically seen in the past. And when you think about remote and virtual, think about breakage. And so, you've got a couple of pressure points putting cycle times \u2013 compressing cycle times. The last thing I would say is new use cases. We continue to see endpoint devices and new use cases in the digital transformation. So, I guess, think about PCs this year as still solid performance, moderating growth especially compared to last year. And by the time we get to the end of the year, when you look at where we are, and you think about the refresh opportunities from 2017 and 2018, those are going to be opening up and then we've got Win 10 end of life coming. So, people are buying PCs, we are in a very good position to make sure that we get our fair share of inventory to supply them. And while we see moderating growth, we just see it as a positive contribution to our overall performance. It's Chris here. I would just add that, as we think about 2022 and 2021, generally, I think we would call 2022 a more normalized, I'll call it, buying environment. We had tremendous hardware sales in 2021 and client demand. And we've said that \u2013 and our strategy is around building our services and cloud capabilities. And we do expect that 2022 is going to require additional services and cloud capabilities, which net down. So, I think we'll see more normalized netting down for 2022. As we look at Q4 and the strength across the segments, the nice thing is it was balanced across transactions and solutions. And I do think \u2013 I'm not going to go back into supply chain, but I do think supply chain ended up impacting growth on some categories across each.  But that said, look, I think in every element, whether it was client devices or infrastructure or cloud, I feel confident that the team has really been outperforming the market in a very balanced way. When you think about the acquisitions we've made and our ability to integrate them very quickly into the organization as practice groups and as part of the larger CDW, areas like security in Focal Point and what we bring to market there and the speed that we're growing there or our Digital Velocity practice and our ServiceNow automation practice and how that is flowing into 54% growth in our services category. So, I feel very good that we are outperforming taking share, and in particular, in those high growth areas where we are investing. Customers are still \u2013 across all of the segments, customers are still prioritizing, whether it's remote, work from home, learn from home, just remote work, work from anywhere, and virtual settings. So, solutions that address those needs are going to continue to drive a solid performance. At the same time, I think the pandemic is really likely going to impact our customers in a slightly different way as we think about 2022 because we're all more prepared to deal with it. So, we are seeing customers absolutely pivot or enhance their investment portfolio and focus on infrastructure, both on-prem refresh, on-prem new technology, particularly software driven, as well as cloud options, to drive resiliency, to drive agility, to drive securing platforms and endpoint devices.  So, 2022, as we think about the products, what we're seeing from customers suggests a very balanced year across the portfolio. That's really how I describe it going into 2022. Here's what I am hearing. Nobody likes price increases, but virtually all commercial customers, technology is the number one investment. People and technology. So, if there's a budget to spend, they're not cutting back on budgets at all. In fact, they might be expanding them. But having to be very disciplined about cost containment. So, again, our expertise across the full spectrum allows us, with our customers, to have conversations that can drive cost reduction, cost management in a way that makes us even more valuable. But we're not finding commercial customers or other customers, for that matter, who are reducing technology investments at all. So, that's the good news. And again, technology is essential to being competitive, to winning, to educating, to doing all the things that companies are trying to do and organizations are trying to do. So, we're not seeing any material impact at this point. And, obviously, we're passing prices along.  Al, I don't know if you'd add anything. Let me start with that one. I think as a starting place, a reminder that with Sirius, we are actively and swiftly bringing them together. So, when you think of some of the other acquisitions we've recently done, they've really been practice areas that can tuck into our technology groups in a holistic way. Sirius, we are going to bring the organization into CDW and literally integrate it. So, as we think about growth in the future, when we say we expect Sirius to drive, at least 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market, what we mean is we expect the teams to perform as CDW has always performed with the benefit of our competitive advantages and outperforming the market. So, we think about it on a combined basis as opposed to a standalone Sirius contribution. Well, let me just add. We will, obviously, as we always do, update as we go through the course of the year, but right now, what we're seeing is a moderation in estimates for GDP. Inflationary trends, uncertain where those will be. And the wildcards in the macro environment, labor shortages, et cetera, I think you're hearing people at the beginning of the year taking a clear eyed view of what to expect in 2020. Look, ASPs could drive it up, but we'll know more as we start to move through the year on all of these things. Thank you, Bailey. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the absolute privilege and opportunity to serve you.  To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Have a great day."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the fourth quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2022 outlook.  Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.5 billion, including one-month contribution from Sirius of $197 million. Consolidated net sales were up 11.7% on a reported basis and 9.9% on an average daily sales basis, as we add one extra selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales was 9.6%, including 3.9 points of contribution from Sirius.  Consistent with the last quarter, net sales in channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year \u2013 corporate, small business and international \u2013 continued to rebound, posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels. This quarter's growth also benefit from strong double-digit performance in health care that was tempered by the expected declines in government and education.  On the supply side, our overall backlog increased a few hundred million dollars in the quarter, reflecting constraints similar to last year. Backlog remained elevated year-over-year. We continue to make strategic investments in inventory, support our customers through this constrained supply environment, and the team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages, so the backlog did not increase even more.  Gross profit for the quarter was $976 million, an increase of 10.8% on a reported basis and resulted in a strong gross margin of 17.6%. Gross margin was positively impacted by the increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily software as a service, in addition to strong professional services performance. This was more than offset by lower product margin and overlapping high margin configurations in the prior year. Sirius' gross profit margin was consistent with their historical performance, and was modestly accretive to the overall gross margin for the quarter.  Turning to SG&A on slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. This reflected the impact of consolidating one month of incremental Sirius expenses. Sirius' sales compensation as a percentage of net sales was higher than our core operations, given the higher mix of solutions and services revenues. The overall increase also reflected higher performance-based compensation, consistent with higher attainment against financial goals and investments in the business, including increased coworker counts.  Coworker counts at the end of the quarter were 13,924, up 2,826 from the third quarter and 3,942 over prior year. Increasing coworker counts during the quarter reflects the addition of over 2,600 Sirius coworkers and other organic and inorganic coworker investments to support high growth solution areas and our own digital transformation.  GAAP operating income was $339 million, up 2.1%. Non-GAAP operating income which better reflects operating performance is $425 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7%.  As we shared on last quarter's call, investments made in the fourth quarter drove an operating margin which delivered our full-year outlook. Sirius' non-GAAP operating margin was consistent with their historic performance and was marginally accretive for the quarter.  Moving to slide 10. Interest expense was $43 million, up 16.9%. The increase reflected the incremental expense on the $2.5 billion of notes issued in December to finance the Sirius acquisition. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 11 was 25.1%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs as shown on slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.5%, up 230 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to one-time tax benefits recognized in the prior year.  As you can see on slide 13, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 138 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.57, down 4.5%. Our non-GAAP net income was $285 million in the quarter, up 8.2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.08, up 14% from last year and reflects the impact of share repurchases.  Turning to full year results on slides 14 through 19. As Chris mentioned, 2021 performance reflected exceptional execution against an effective strategy along with the power of our business model and balanced portfolio.  Net sales were $20.8 billion, an increase of 12.7% on a reported basis and average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, full-year consolidated net sales grew 11.9%, including 110 basis point contribution from Sirius.  Gross profit was $3.6 billion, up 11.2%, and gross profit margin was 17.1%, down approximately 30 basis points year-over-year. In 2021, software and services accounted for approximately 41% of total gross profit, up 100 basis points from last year. The increase reflects investment in our services and solution capabilities and a continued shift into netted down revenues like software as a service.  Before moving down the rest of the full-year P&L, I want to take a moment to put netted down revenues into perspective. Netted down revenues results from software as a service, software assurance and warranty solutions as well as agent commission fees. We're not the primary obligor for these solutions, and thus record gross profit as our revenue and why you sometimes hear us refer to these as 100% gross margin items.  In the past, we shared examples of how this accounting treatment has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars, but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins all else equal. Over the last five years, our netted down revenue strength as a percentage of total gross revenues or customer spend has increased 10 percentage points. The greater mix reflects increased customer spend on fast growing netted down revenue streams, like cloud and security.  Long term, as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and invest in the capabilities necessary to ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of our customers, we expect a mix further in the high growth netted down revenue streams. This mix dynamics will pressure net sales while remaining neutral to gross profit and expanding gross margin. This, of course, is subject to hardware refresh cycles and other mix components of the business.  While much of what I've described is tied to the accounting treatment, it is also a reflection of our success in the execution of our strategy to capture share, enhance capabilities in high growth solution and expand services.  Returning to the full-year P&L. Operating income was $1.4 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.6 billion, up 17.1%. Net income was $989 million. Non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion, up 17.2%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $7.97, up 20.9%.  Turning to the balance sheet on slide 20. On December 31, cash and cash equivalents were $258 million and net debt was $6.6 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.2 billion.  Moving to slide 21, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 24 days, up 7 days from last year's fourth quarter. In addition to our strategy of holding customer-driven stocking positions, the increase reflected mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles and the timing of customer receipts. This is partially offset by the timing of payments at the end of the year.  Full-year free cash flow was $477 million, as shown on slide 22. This is lighter than last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing, one-time items, and advantageous vendor payment terms. In 2021, our free cash flow was also impacted by increased working capital to support our strong full-year growth.  We also leveraged our strong balance sheet and distribution capabilities to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers in this unprecedented supply environment. As a result, 2021 free cash flow was below a rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of sales. Timing differences, one-time items and noted investments resulted in asymmetrical free cash flows across 2020 and 2021. In aggregate, 2020 and 2021 free cash flows balanced out and equated to 4.3% of net sales, slightly above the high end of our free cash flow rule of thumb.  In 2021, we delivered on our capital allocation objectives and deployed more than $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders, which included $235 million of dividends and $1.5 billion to share repurchases at an average price of approximately $172 per share.  Turning to 2022 capital allocation priorities on slide 23. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target a dividend of approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings.  Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended this year at 3.4 times above our range due to the financing of the Sirius acquisition. We intend to optimize the use of cash flow after paying dividends to focus on reducing debt until we return to our net leverage range. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022.  As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases, and so net leverage is in our target range.  Moving to the outlook for 2022 on slide 24. As Chris mentioned, our outlook is built off the combined 2021 CDW and Sirius results, which presents these numbers as if we own Sirius at the start of 2021. Let me walk you through how this looks.  Starting with sales, given what we're seeing in the market now, our baseline outlook assumes US market growth 3.5%. We currently expect combined net sales to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. On a combined basis. CDW's net sales would have been $22.9 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius. We expect Sirius to grow in line with total CDW. Right now, 2022 feels like a normal demand environment and expect it will reflect a greater mix in the netted down revenues as we overlap strong client device sales. Our baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we've been experiencing. We would expect it to be to be at the lower end of our premium range if we've mixed more into netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experienced elevated levels of supply constraints. We would be at the higher end if hardware growth is strong and supply improves.  Currency is expected to be neutral for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.37 to the British pound and $0.80 to the Canadian dollar.  Moving down the P&L, we expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. Our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $8.49 in 2021 on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97, which included one month of Sirius. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow high-single digits in 2022, call it 9.25%, plus or minus 50 basis points in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to approximately 16% to 17% growth in constant currency on a reported basis.  As Chris mentioned, the integration work with Sirius is progressing. And given the nature of the integrated sales, we will not be breaking out Sirius results going forward. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our combined financial outlook on an annual constant currency basis.  Slide 24 provides our expected net sales split for the year. We expect net sales in the first half of the year to be in line with our historic norm of 48% to 49%. Sirius' sales split is slightly higher in the second half than historic CDW. Historically, we see a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1.  This year, on a reported basis, we expect first quarter sequential growth in the low-single digits, reflecting three months of contribution from Sirius versus one month in Q4. We expect first quarter constant currency non-GAAP earnings per share growth relative to Q1 2021 to be in the low mid-teens, reflecting seasonality and channel mix.  Modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can also be found on slide 25.  In addition, you can see our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. We expect CapEx to run approximately 70 basis points to 75 basis points as a percentage of net sales, reflecting our continued view that now is the time to continue to accelerate investment in our own digital transformation, enabling us to further fortify our competitive position, make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers, and vendor partners.  That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macroenvironment and our business on future earnings calls.  And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. And can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up? Thank you. So just a couple of things to note. So, I think we've given you some component parts to get a sense for EPS. So number one, obviously, our reported EPS for 2021 was $7.97. That includes one month of contribution for Sirius. We've also provided you what would be a combined CDW and Sirius result for 2021 as if they were together for the full year. That's $8.49. So, the way you should think about it is if you walk forward from that $8.49 to our outlook there of 9.25% growth, you get a sense for the combined entities and what they contribute.  The other data point I would just give you is that we noted that, from a top line perspective, we'd expect that Sirius would grow at the same rate as we provided in that top line outlook.  To your question on synergies. So, here's what I would say. Look, we're very focused on the integration of the combined entities. And we expect through that, we're going to find value in terms of synergies on the revenue front. We're certainly looking hard at procurement efficiencies, systems consolidations, facilities consolidation, all of those components, and we expect we're going to get value.  But, Amit, I would just mention that it's critically important as we talk about our strategy that we continue to invest in our strategy. And I would say as it pertains to synergies, reinvest. And so, while we expect we're going to see value, we expect that a lot of those values we get from the synergy be reinvested in 2022. Look, I would say, comments on the supply environment, Q4 looked very similar to the prior quarters in terms of the supply environment. Our backlog increased consistent with those previous quarters, call it a couple hundred million of backlog increase.  Look, there are some puts and takes in terms of what supply chain would look like in Q4 and I would say probably a bit more challenged on the solution side of the business. And I think that's natural as these efforts evolve over time. As we look forward into 2022, we don't really see any meaningful end in sight. I would say, as we think about kind of our interactions and what we hear and observe from a partner and product perspective, maybe there's silver lining there that some of the transparency has improved. So, there's a better line of sight of lead times and where things stand, but I'm not sure that we would translate that into any indication of things are going to get better in the near term. And so, really, we're hunkered down on consistent similar outlook with respect to this supply chain environment and we'll continue to execute as we have during this time. I think you hit a lot of the right points. So, look, on the full year, we're confident in our growth expectations. There certainly is a timing and effect. And there are a few puts and takes in that regard. So, number one, in terms of sequentially from Q4 to Q1, we've got the positive that we'll have three months of contribution from Sirius. So that certainly helps from a top line perspective.  You will recall we have some tough comps, otherwise, and particularly in education, with Q1, so that has a bit of an offsetting effect. So, when we add up that, along with our typical seasonality, we would be back to kind of our 48/52 split in terms of seasonality.  Now, look, there's the wildcards. And those wildcards include what type of product throughput are we seeing and will it be more hardware focused versus services and solution? And I would just say the obvious wildcard is supply and that will certainly change the shape and direction of timing by quarter. I'll just add a couple of things. So number one, just from a compensation perspective, Chris hit the key points there in terms of alignment. Just keep in mind, because their business has a higher proportion of services solutions, that variable fixed component of the business looks a little different. They have a higher cost to serve with their technical staff. And so, that will shift. I don't think that's a diametrical shift immediately. We'll see that over time as we integrate.  On your question on systems consolidation, look, it's a little early days. I think we've laid down the foundation of kind of the initial evaluation of systems. And I think we're pleased to see that there's really strong infrastructure from a Sirius perspective. And so, we're really lining up for an approach of best in breed from a systems perspective, and we think there's going to be opportunities to take on some of the technology tools they have, as well as vice versa. So, we'll share more as we have that, but we're making good progress on that front. Let me start with that. And Chris may have something to add there. So, we are assuming no change in the supply environment relative to what we experienced in 2021. So, just recall, if look back the last three quarters, we've quoted that our backlog has increased several hundred million dollars through 2021. That's notwithstanding that written demand continue to be extremely strong. So, if you look at our actual printed results, there are times we look at it and say, you can't really see the effect of the significant backlog. So, I think our expectation would be that supply chain will continue to work as it has. And I think you may have some pluses and minuses through that in terms of solutions versus transactions and byproducts. But lo and behold, I think that supply assumptions are very consistent with what we've seen in 2021. Let me address it. So, first, just on a year-over-year basis, the growth is not muted. It's in the teens in terms of growth. I think just on the \u2013 comment on the sequential is the one obviously coming off of a very strong Q4, but the comps for education, much more significant in Q1 relative to Q4 there, and so that mutes the impact. You get a bit of a kind of contra going the other way with, again, Sirius, but there's some of the puts and takes. If you just focus on that year-over-year, that was very strong. First, again, just [Technical Difficulty], supply chain would look similar to 2021. I think we've mentioned before, there is a component of backlog in supply chain, and includes pull forward of business. And I think as our partners became more and more clued into and kind of have gotten clarity of lead times and so forth, they've encouraged us and encouraged customers to get in line. And I think through 2021, that has happened. And we would expect that will continue to happen. In terms of how that plays out and what that might look like, I think that now \u2013 I think we could look at our backlog and say we've got a pretty balanced portfolio there of pull forward business as well as current business. And so, for those very reasons, we don't believe that the backlog will ultimately result or play out as a full flush or a big bang, if you will. It's going to feather in over time. So, I think it's going to be probably a bit episodic in terms of continue to progress from individual partners and products in terms of how that plays out and how fast it moves. But again, as we sit here now, we would say we would not expect that to be anything that happens near term. And our hope is that, later 2022, we start to see that feather out. Yeah, just a couple of comments, Shannon. So, obviously, ASPs have varied quite a bit by product. And it is partially a function of availability and just supply chain environment. I would say that, in pockets, customers are getting more creative. They're willing to accept substitutes in terms of different products, and they're willing to kind of think about solutions in different ways. And that's certainly helped to free up some capacity. I'd say our partners have done an exceptional job doing the same. So there definitely is price pressure. I would say that largely customers are getting through that. Written demand continues to be extremely strong. Written  And then, just for us, right, our job is and what we're focused on is how do we serve our customers best and bring in the best solutions. And as it pertains to financial impacts, obviously, I think we've done a really nice job, making sure that we can pass through these price increases where they happen and insulate ourselves from a gross profit perspective. First, notwithstanding Sirius, we would expect that we would have made progress on our gross margins and our NGOI margins. You add Sirius and that's obviously accretive as well. And we actually think the power of the organizations coming together, that's going to make that really meaningful.  Just keep in mind, so we are providing outlook to that low 8, and it's the combination of that inorganic and organic. Just keep in mind, there are wildcards, right, that will be influenced by things like supply chain, it will be influenced by how much the business is transactional versus solutions. But again, as we sit here today, we feel really good about our prospects to continue to make progress on our margins. Yes, really pointing back to what we've provided on the investor meeting for Sirius, we noted that their gross margins are higher than ours. And so, we would certainly expect that that accretive effect is going to come through. And again, in addition to our progress, otherwise. Now, look, we don't provide outlook. So I'm not going to quote for you specifically what our gross margins would be. But I think if you apply the math on where we're coming out, from an NGOI margin outlook perspective, you get a good sense of the progress we expect we're going to make. And maybe just one thing I would add there in terms of your comments about value we add and the synergies. So, look, I think we've talked about the more immediate impacts that can be made from an accretive perspective on margin. And we do fully believe that putting the combined entities together will be powerful and will lead to value. Look, if we think long run, certainly short run, that's going to provide benefits. And we think long run, taking those synergies and those values and saying let's continue to put them back into the business, from a long run perspective, that's where the real upside is. So, we think that 2022 will show great progress in terms of our accretion on margin on our progress, on our strategy and those investments and reinvestments will further reinforce that build for the future. Look, I don't know if I have one single answer in terms of the impact. I will say that and reiterate the written demand continues to be super strong. So, as we think about the growth of prices, which have been meaningful in different pockets across our product set, it has not stopped demand. And I think that is, like Chris said, a testament to the power of technology and the importance of technology and the fact that our vast customer base is looking to go forward and continuing to invest in their own efforts in digital transformation. And so, really, if you look from a top line perspective, in terms of revenue, we don't think it's had a meaningful impact. [indiscernible] demand is definitely still there. And our belief is that will largely continue."

But before I get started, I do want to pause for a moment to honor the life and legacy of our former CEO, Tom Richards, who passed away last week after a valiant fight with cancer. I suspect most of you on this call have likely met Tom in-person. I'm certain that everyone on this call has been impacted by Tom. He was a fierce competitor and equally a kind human being. Tom had a lot of what we like to call it CDW Tomism. Simple ways of getting to the essence of something in a way that it stuck. One of my personal favorites is when Tom used to say, At CDW, we take what we do seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. That's the essence of who we are. That is our CDW culture. Captured those simply and amplified those strongly, by Tom Richards. Tom also had an unexpected way of signing off on our earnings calls, usually with a right comment about an upcoming holiday, like Halloween or Mother's Day, or even Valentine's Day. As a result, we always ended these calls on a high note and with a chuckle. Tom knew his audience well. In honor of Tom, I'd like to kick off this earnings call with the tagline he penned on every communication to a co-worker. Tom always signed off with \"you make a difference. \" Literally injecting into each co-worker Tom's personal belief in them, and their important impact. On behalf of all of our coworkers around the globe, our customers and our partners, our communities and our investors, I would like to say thank you to Tom. You made a difference. Let me turn now to Q3 performance. Once again, CDW posted strong top-line growth and profitability. Overall, demand was strong and the teams did a great job addressing customer needs.  For the quarter we delivered record net sales of $5.311 billion, 0.4% higher than last year, and up 10.7% in constant-currency, non-GAAP operating income of $435 million up 12.6% and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.13, 13.4% higher than last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant-currency. Our ability to deliver this strong top line and profitability was the result of 3 key drivers; our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio, and our ongoing execution against our three-part strategy, which is focused on taking share and investing in solutions and capabilities our customers need and want. Let me walk through each one of these and share some detail about how they contributed to our performance.  First, our balanced portfolio of customer and markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, healthcare, government, which includes federal and state and local customers, and education with K-12 and higher ed. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own way. Often, different factors impact these diverse customer end markets. And this quarter we saw that play out as our commercial business in the U.S. are small on corporate channels. And our international operations posted significant double-digit increases, while our U.S. public business posted a mid-single-digit decline. From a macro perspective, supply remained under pressure this quarter. Demand outpaced supply and lead times extended particularly in several solutions areas. The team continued to leverage our distribution centers, expensive logistics capabilities, keep vendor partner relationships, and strong Balance Sheet, and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. They did an exceptional job working with our partners to stay on top of availability status. Our sellers and technical specialists also worked with customers and whenever possible, found alternative available product and built alternative solutions. These efforts helped mitigate some of the pressure and our backlog increase was consistent with last quarter. The tight supply environment continued to impact prices, which our teams were generally able to pass along. Let's take a deeper look at third quarter customer and market performance. Commercial customer priorities remain the same as in the second quarter, digital transformation, security, and hybrid and cloud solutions. Customers continue to prioritize investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure platform and endpoints. Within this backdrop, corporate increased 25% and customer demand remained strong. While many customers delayed return to office, they continued to prepare as well as invest to facilitate hybrid work.  This drove ongoing strong double-digit increases in transactions propelled by notebooks, audio visual, and desktop. At the same time, digital transformation remains a top priority. While buying sentiment was clearly there, in many cases, the product was not. Writings were strong, but with extended lead time, backlog built during the quarter. Lack of product availability, particularly in Netcom and storage, muted corporate solutions growth. Small business also delivered another exceptional quarter of growth, increasing almost 40%. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement, security, and video, driving strong growth across both transactional and solutions categories. As we have shared previously, small business customers tend to be more flexible in their technology requirements. So while they did see some impact from supply constraints, small business did not experience as much at corporate. A great example of the power of diverse end markets.  You also see the power of our diverse end markets in our public performance. Net sales for our government channels decreased 33%. federal declines double-digit in large part due to the overlapping of our devices in Service Solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other clients advice programs that were particularly strong last year. Security remains robust with net sales up more than 30%. The gears of Washington were slower than typical at federal year-end, and we had contracting delays in several large contracts. This is not unusual, given the magnitude of federal contracts, timing can influence performance. You've heard us talk about federal lumpy nature in the past. This will unwind and we expect to see a reversal back to growth in the first half of 2022. State and local posted a mid-single-digit decline. Stimulus funding remained largely unallocated to the local level. This is because access to multi-year American Rescue Plan Act funding with deadlines in 2024, lead to greater focus on multi-year budget planning. At the same time, state and local customers were focused on digesting last year's meaningful stimulus funded IT investments. We continue to work with our customers, but given the complexity of the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing, we do not expect to see projects moving ahead meaningfully until early 2022. Education increased by 2%. Higher Ed delivered high single-digit growth driven by ongoing focus on campus connectivity, and enhancing the dorm room experience with double-digit growth in both security software and servers. The K-12 team did an excellent job and matched last year's record net sales, coming in flat on top of last year's 30% plus growth.  This was consistent with the expectations we shared on our year-end 2020 call, where we looked for strong non-seasonal first-half performance to be followed by a deceleration in the second half. Chromebook availability continued to improve during the quarter, and client devices increased low single-digits on top of last year's stimulant equity and access driven growth. Overall, transactions increased low single-digits on top of last year's strong double-digit growth. Solutions declined driven by a double-digit decline in Netcom largely reflecting supply challenges. We continue to expect above historical net sales against some very tough unseasonal fourth quarter compares. Healthcare posted a 31% increase. By the second wave of COVID, staff shortages and limited ICU bed availability during the quarter, some projects that had been sidelined did resume.  This was particularly the case in security as healthcare remains a target for cybercrime. Our security experts continue to guide hospital systems to find the best solutions that protect their sensitive data and security sales increased strong double-digits. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations increased over 30% on a reported basis. Both the UK and Canada delivered mid-20% growth in local currency. Customer priorities in both markets remain the same as the U.S. Digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions, as do their investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations. Both operations experienced increased back-orders. Clearly, the 11% plus sales growth we delivered, demonstrates the power of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. It also demonstrates the power of the second driver of our performance [Indiscernible] this quarter, the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio, which you can see in our major category performance.  Transactions increased low double-digits driven by client device growth in video. Solutions were flat with double-digit increases in servers and collaboration. Once again, increased [Indiscernible] from double-digit. We saw robust growth across all 3 top cloud workloads, security, infrastructure as-a-service, and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. And once again, given [Indiscernible] importance to our customers, our security practice delivered at first [Indiscernible] was up strong double-digits. Our teams continue to guide customers on their security posture. Assess the environment, design the best approach, and deploy and manage the solutions throughout its lifecycle. Overall, for the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in hardware, low-single-digit growth in software, and strong double-digit growth in services. Software net sales increased low-single-digit, strong double-digit increase in security software, database software, and backup, and recovery were partially offset by declines in network management, software storage, and telephony related software. As I have shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. This [Indiscernible] contribution and was driven by both professional and managed services. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making in our three-part strategy for growth. As you know, in October, we announced our planned acquisition of Sirius Computer Solutions. When we announced the acquisition, I shared how it deepens and adds scale to our services capabilities. Capabilities that will ensure we remain the trusted technology advisor to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation. Notice EBITDA deepens, Sirius is additive to our existing capabilities.  Capabilities we have built for both organic and inorganic investments. Capabilities that enable us to serve customers as their trusted advisor, whether in a physical, digital, or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally. Why so many investments in services capabilities? Simply put, services are becoming an increasingly larger component of total customer IT spend. For CDW services position us to enable the whole solution, increase our engagement with customers and stickiness, and provide insight into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IP life cycle. Today, IT leaders are accountable for both running -- to both run the business and transform it, leaders need to invest resources where they can have the greatest impact. And do so with the greatest speed. Services are critical to making this happen. To address this full-stack and full lifecycle, our technical organization has grown to more than 3,700 pre -sale specialists and engineers.  Today, we can deliver complex digital [Indiscernible] let me share an example of how our services team is helping the global online home retailer transform their business for their next wave of growth. Experience from [Indiscernible] customer opt is for a combination of [Indiscernible] public cloud technologies and new cloud-native plant -- pattern. This would create the agility they needed [Indiscernible] environment. A great idea, but accelerating cloud technology requires specialized expertise that is inefficient to keep on staff, and that is for CDW payment. First we leveraged our cloud managed services and offloaded some of the cloud projects from the customer to CDW. Then we pulled in our digital velocity talents orchestration services for DVT. DVT orchestration supplies customers with talent to work inside the customer's existing team, Talent that is becoming more and more vital in today's environment. Digital velocity, talent, orchestration delivers highly vetted resources, whether already employed by CDW or sourced by us.  CDW services, enabled the solution. But it did so much more. As you can imagine, this level of high touch integration creates customer loyalty with ongoing relationships on the ground, and continued exchange between CDW and the customer, ultimately leading to more business. Great for the customer, and great for CDW. This is an excellent example of our three-part strategy in action and how M&A enhances our organic investments to ensure we remain our customer's number one choice as a trusted advisor. Solving key business problems for our customer in today's environment requires strong service and solutions capabilities. Capabilities that when combined with our great relationships and competitive advantages of skill, scope, and disciplined execution, enable us to win in the marketplace and deliver sustainable, profitable growth today and in the future.  And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. We continue to look for growth in 2021 to come in between 9 and 1/4% and 10% in [Indiscernible] report currency. Split roughly between 5% IT market growth and 425 to 500 basis points to CDW market outperformance. This reflects our expectation that supply constraints do not mitigate anytime in the near future, but do not get materially worse. Remember these constraints don't just reflect component shortages, but also labor and logistics challenges, challenges we do not expect to reverse in the near-term, and challenges that we do not expect to resolve at the flush, but rather gradually. As far as wildcards, in addition to the fluid supply situation and the potential for another wave of COVID, given the slowdown in the third quarter GDP growth, we will keep a watchful eye out for any slowdown in the economy. As we do, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out execute our competition. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place. A strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro or customer-specific challenges and positions us for sustainable growth. A strategy designed to continue our evolution as the leading IT solutions provider. And most importantly, a strategy that delivers profitable growth and returns to shareholders.  This confidence underpins today's action by our board to increase our quarterly cash dividend by 25%. I know many of you may be wondering what we expect for next year. We're in the middle of our planning process, and as we always do, we'll provide our outlook for 2022 on our year-end conference call. And with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al.\nAl Miralles: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with more detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with the 2021 outlook. Turning to our third quarter P&L on slide 8, consolidated net sales were $5.3 billion, up 11.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7% Net sales and channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year, corporate, small business, and international continue to rebound. Posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels. This quarter's growth also benefited from strong double-digit performance in healthcare, but was tempered by a slowdown in education and declining government. On the supply side, overall backlog increased several $100 million in the quarter and continues to be elevated year-over-year. The team did a great job leveraging CDW 's competitive advantages so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $915 million, an increase of 10.8% on a reported basis. Gross margin was 17.3%, down approximately 10 basis points versus last year. This is primarily driven by lower product margin, partially offset by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily in softwares and service, in addition to strong professional and managed services performance. Turning to SG&A on slide 9, non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. increases primarily driven by payroll costs, including sales compensation, which moves with gross profit growth, and performance-based compensation, consistent with higher attainment against financial goals. Finally, it reflects investments in the business, including increased co-worker counts, focused on execution of our strategy.  Co-worker count at the end of the third quarter was 11,098, up 432 from the second quarter, and 1118 over prior year. The increase in co-worker count reflects organic and organic -- inorganic investments to support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. GAAP operating income was $386 million, up 21.6%. non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $435 million up 12.6% And non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.2%. Moving to slide 10, interest expense was $36 million down 9.4%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year's refinancing. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 23.9%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we just taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs as shown on Slide 12.  For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.3% up 200 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to a onetime impact of state and foreign tax benefits recognized in the prior year. As you can see on slide 13, the second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of a $139 million, GAAP net income per share was a $1.91, up 43.2%. Our non-GAAP net income was $298 million in the quarter up 12.3%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.13, up 16.4% from last year. Turning to year-to-date results in slides 14 through 19, net sales were $15 billion, an increase of 13.1% on a reported basis, and 13.7% on an average daily sales basis. We had one fewer selling day year-to-date in 2021, which will be made up in Q4, we have one extra selling day compared to the prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, year-to-date consolidated net sales were 12.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $2.6 billion up 11.3% and gross profit margin was 17% down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was roughly $1.1 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion up 18.7%. Net income was $773 million and non-GAAP net income was $834 million up 20.7%. non-GAAP net income per share was $5.89, up 23.5%. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 20, at September 30th, cash and cash equivalents were $245 million, and net debt was $3.8 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion.  Year-to-date free cash flow was $341 million as shown on slide 21. This is lighter than last year's record, $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and one time items. Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. Additionally, working capital increased to support our strong year-to-date growth, and we continue to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers through this choppy supply environment. Moving to slide 22, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 9 days from last year's third quarter. Increase was primarily driven by mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles, in addition to holding customer-driven stocking positions, and the timing of receipts and shipments. Turning to capital allocation on slide 23, our 2021 priorities remain the same. First, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP Net Income, including today's 25% increase to the dividend.  The increased annual dividend of $2 is approximately 25% of trailing 12-month non-GAAP Net Income through September. The Q4 2021 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power, and cash flow generation of the business. It marks the 8th consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013. Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 36% from its initial level. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio going forward, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, we ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the third quarter at 2.3 times. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Sirius, which we announced on October 18th, and our recent Focal Point and Amplified IT acquisitions are great examples.  And fourth, we return excess cash after dividends and M&A, to shareholders through share repurchases. During the quarter, we continued to deploy cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $505 million to shareholders, including $55 million in dividends and $450 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $188 per share. We continue to expect to return approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders for the full-year of 2021, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Going forward, we continue to execute against our capital allocation priorities as we have done since 2014. In 2022, post closing of the Sirius acquisition, we expect to have an initial net leverage ratio of approximately 3.3 times. While our capital allocation priorities will remain the same, we will shift our objectives to focus on paying the dividend and reducing debt. As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on M&A and share repurchases until our net leverage is in our target range of 2.5 to 3 times, which we expect to achieve by the end of 2022. We continue to expect to close the Sirius acquisition in December, and we intend to share additional thoughts on the financial impacts of consolidating Sirius into CDW on our fourth quarter call. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on slide 24. Supply and product lead times remain fluid, making it challenging to comprehensively forecast the high degree of confidence.  On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with both U.S. and international commercial customers. On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Constraints continue to notebooks, desktops, video, Netcom, and data center categories, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call. We do not expect it to improve in the near future. With that context for full-year 2021, we continue to expect the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5% and our net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market in constant currency. This assumes a consistent supply chain environment and impact to our backlog.  We feel good about the health of the business, and we continue to navigate the fluid supply environment. We continue to expect currency to contribute in an approximately 80 basis points the full-year net sales growth, assuming exchange rates of a $1.38, the British pound and $0.80 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we now expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the high 7% range for full-year 2021, as you've heard us say, we believe now is the time to invest in the business and expect investments made in the fourth quarter to drive an operating margin which will deliver our full-year outlook. Putting it all together, we now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the high teens, call it 18% plus or minus 25 basis points. Currency is expected to contribute an additional 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. For free cash flow, our long-term rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.5% of net sales, assuming current tax rates.  However, given the timing impacts that contributed 2020's significant over delivery and ongoing customer-driven stocking positions, as well as the time of receipts and shipments, we expect 2021 free cash flow to come in slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts and the components of free cash flow, including capital expenditures, and the cash conversion cycle, can also be found on slide 25. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator open up for questions, and we would just please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. If you would like to register a question, [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Tindle at Raymond James. Adam your line is open.\nAdam Tindle : Okay. Thank you, and good morning. Chris, I wanted to start on Sirius to see if you had some early feedback from customers now that the announcement has been out and specifically wondering if those Sirius enterprise customers are perhaps willing to breach the conversation on utilizing CDW's transactional portfolio that Sirius didn't have? And conversely, the CDW mid-market customers more interested in Sirius' services portfolio? So a qualitative view from the customer perspective on potential revenue synergies in this deal.\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Adam. Thanks for the question. And you know, we're in a little bit of a quiet period here as we go through the various regulatory approvals. That said, one of the areas that we focused very quickly was feedback, and I would just tell you, it's been really, really positive on both fronts. So our customers at CDW are delighted about the acquisition, and really looking forward to the combined entity and the capabilities that they helped bolster CDW, given their reputation in the market and the quality of their services and the reciprocal is true as well. I talked to Joe Martin late in the day of the announcement, and he had made his way through a lot of customers as had their front-line sellers, and it was for the most part all positive. So again, we think that -- I said the word before, a home-run deal and we're going to make it work really well, and our customers seem to be excited, our partners equally are thrilled. It 's exactly what they were looking for us to do and they are thrilled.\nAdam Tindle : Right. And I think that aspect of home-run deal has some investors wondering a little bit more on Sirius recent performance. The purchase price was very attractive, all cash in nature, and there's some skepticism on what's been going on with the business in 2021. I know you gave us color based on 2020, but maybe you could help to spell any of that concern by talking about what you've seen out of Sirius ' performance in 2021?\nChris Leahy: Well, you know, look, they're doing just fine and there are customers like us in areas like Federal, which we talked about today, or enterprise customers. And as you know, that can be a lumpy business. So when we did our diligence and looked at the pipeline and the types of programs they're running with customers they were having a similar impact that we were having with regard to our larger customers. Some things being delayed, some things being planned yet not -- not yet rolled out necessarily, particularly in terms of delays in going back to the office, etc. But I would tell you that we feel very confident, Adam, in the health of the business, in the prospects of the business in the pipeline for the business and in the opportunities for Sirius and CDW, the combined entity.\nAdam Tindle : Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nChris Leahy: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shannon Cross at Cross Research. Shannon, your line is open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to take a bit more into backlog composition, if you're seeing any order cancellations or how it -- how it developed over the quarter, maybe linearity just to get an idea of how sustainable and sticky do you think the backlog will be?\nAl Miralles: Yeah. Good morning Shannon. This is Al. So a couple of things that I would note. So going in in the quarter, we maybe would have expected that there would be a bit of a kind of a modest view of backlog. I'd say overall for the quarter was a bit more than modest. And let's call it, in terms of just all characteristics, similar to Q2. A couple of variants or components that maybe looked a little different, and I think Chris touched on this in your prepared remarks, is that we saw a bit more of an effect from a solutions perspective and that would have included notably Netcom and storage. Notwithstanding that similar to Q2. And look, I would just note the -- all things considered, the team did an exceptional job navigating through that and delivering on the results.\nShannon Cross: Okay, so you -- but you don't -- you're not seeing double orders? You're not worried about any kind of loss of backlog?\nAl Miralles: We are not. I would just note the look. I think there's component in the backlog that there's likely some pull-forward, right? It's been a tenuous environment and so there are customers that I think probably have a perspective that knowing that this doesn't have an clear end date. [Indiscernible] maybe get in front of some of their projects, and so there's probably component that's pulled forward. We're not feeling the effects, or seeing the effects of either double bookings.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick question on -- Chris, maybe, how are you thinking about inflation? And clearly you can pass through higher product costs. But I just sort of in general, as you go through your budgeting and planning for 2022, you know, are you thinking more transitory or are you sort of planning for some of these cost increases to be here for the long term. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, I understand. And we'll share more with our -- about our planning next year as we think about it. Look, it feels like the perspective out there is maybe a little worse than transitory. And so we will just keep our eye on the economy and how this could impact in particular different segments of our business. For example, when you think about small business, they are really doing a terrific job right now, but we're keeping a very close eye on that segment of the market to understand how the economy might be impacting them, where their optimism is, their ability to hire, etc. So as we always do, we'll keep an eye on it. It feels a little worse than transitory but again, we think that technology is an A1 priority, and our customers will continue to invest in technology if in fact, it becomes a little more extent that we think they'll keep the priority there. And look, if we can keep the economy coming out of the pandemic with the momentum we seem to be building and positive nature in the economy, we're feeling pretty good.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya of [Indiscernible].\nRupplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Chris, I wanted to ask about the education market. In 3Q '20, 4Q '20, you had two billion dollar quarters. And again, this year in June and September, you've again had two billion quarters. So there's a year-on-year headwind from the Mississippi Department of Education project that you had in December and your headwinds, you've had from a stronger year-ago quarter.\nChris Leahy: Good morning Rupplu and thanks for reminding the team of the great performance, they will appreciate that. Look, you know, we called this out earlier in the year and I mentioned it again, in our prepared -- my prepared remarks. But it's really been unseasonal and we expected to see the first half of this year be quite [Indiscernible] we're lapping a big back half of the year, that we would expect to still continue to see, I'll call it solid performance, and it's a bit unseasonal because it's the end of the year. But if we need to [Indiscernible] in our view, and it's going to be -- it'll be difficult to overcome the level of growth that we saw last year. That said Rupplu, if the stimulus funding, for example the emergency connectivity [Indiscernible] is yet another source of funds for education institutions to be able to fortify their classrooms since hybrid environment. The one thing with that funding is schools are able to use it for orders that are placed that we're working our way through.  What of that money relates to orders that have been placed? We're confident that there is a large portion that are additive to the base. And again, the team, as they always do, has done a phenomenal job helping our k-12 customers work through that funding. So as you've heard me say before, I feel very confident in education over the long term. It is a growth area. The education market has inflection points and we have always been ahead of those inflection points. Whether it's how the classroom itself changes, whether it's going to hybrid, whatever those are, we are usually there and I'll tell you, Amplified IT, which we just added is taking us to yet another [Indiscernible] level with their cloud-enabled capabilities and their IT developed technology that they offer for classrooms. So I'll pass you [Indiscernible] here, but the team is doing very well, a long-term growth area.\nRupplu Bhattacharya: Thanks for all the details there, Chris. Maybe for my follow-up, if I can ask Al about operating margins. So you had another good quarter, another quarter of above 8% operating margin and you're guiding, and an increase for the full-year to high 7s. If we just look at core CDW and not consider Sirius right now, which is accretive to the Company. But if we just look at core CDW, do you think that having a high 7s operating margin is a sustainable level going forward, what are the puts and takes that we need to keep in mind?\nAl Miralles: Yes. Sure. And thanks for the question, Rupplu. So I think you just hit it at the end there. Look, there are -- there are lots of puts and takes in any given quarter, and I will just start, if you just put aside the supply chain environment, right? Mix does really matter. So if we think about components, what's transactional, what solutional from a mix perspective that matters, channel mix matters, all those things have an impact, I'll say to start on your gross margin and obviously then the kinda, the dropdown from an operating margin perspective. So let's just keep that in mind. And again, kind of supply chain will matter as well. In the case of this particular quarter and maybe as an example.  So there -- in terms of mix there, that is a little bit less public mix from a channel perspective. And then you have got -- you've got transactional solution [Indiscernible]. And then very notably Rupplu, I will just note the fact that your 100% gross margin items will have an impact in this quarter. Our 100% gross margin items grew faster than our net sales. So that's going to have an impact as well. And so again, all of that steeped in focus on gross margin. Then finally, if we walk that down operating margin, it 's been just a matter of the -- at what pace are -- is our non-GAAP [Indiscernible] SG&A spend happening. In the case of this quarter, I would say our non-GAAP SG&A spend lagged some of that growth in gross profit, and so we dropped more to the operating margin for the quarter.  And when you look to our outlook relative to what that operating margin was for this quarter, we're up and it's going to balance this back up to a high 7s on the operating margin. As you look forward, look, I think you've got a good sense for this strategy and the movement in where we're going longer-term in terms of mixing into services and mixing in on a 100% gross margin. But all those mix components will manner as we go forward.\nRupplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question on the line comes from Jim Suva at Citi group. Jim, your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Probably a question for [Indiscernible] Chris, but when we think about stimulus, you know, the timing of it, the political nature of it is a little bit hard to pinpoint. But then when we layer in the supply chain challenges and deal with schools, and local governments, and smaller size governments and municipalities who may not be as tech savvy as the Fortune 50 or 500. Can you talk a little bit about the visibility? Are they starting to place smart orders or starting to say, hey, if this gets approved and if we get this amount, here's what I want because it seems like with the long lead times, if they say they want to implement something in the summer for education, we're getting to a point of window where you won't be able to procure the items so you need talk.\nChris Leahy: There's many different segments so let me start. I think where -- you were going there. Yeah, It's complicated, right. We've got the supply ecosystem that is -- it has some impact to it right now so we're trying to manage through all of that. Here's what I'd say about K-through-12. You know, we have a lot of experience understanding funding, stimulus funding, and other types of funding for educational institutions. So we sit side-by-side with our customers to make sure they understand both where the dollars can be used, for what products in particular, or for what outcomes, because sometimes it's outcome-based? And what the deadlines are, and what those deadlines mean? Do you have to have the product in-house, do you have to have the product order placed? So there's a lot of navigating that's going on, and I feel highly confident that the team is doing a phenomenal job with our customers and that our K-12 customers are not going to lose out on any funding.  That's really clear. in the state and local space where we've got stimulus funding coming down. It's been a bit complicated because the funding packages, there were 3 of them as we've talked about before, the CARES Act package, for example, had a deadline at the end of this coming year, that was for March of last year. The end of last year, it was -- there was nothing for state and locals in the stimulus package. And then this March, there was a hefty amount. But as we all know when it comes to state and local, it's about budget cycles and it's about funding deadline. So the spending that's taken place in 2021, is primarily from the CARES package with a deadline this year. What we're seeing now is -- I don't want to call it slowing down, but I'm going to say a moderating and planning, and state and local governments now have that funding where they don't have to spend it till the end of 2024.  And so they are now looking at a multiyear approach. Pretty unusual, this multiyear approach but that's what they're doing. And we're helping them with it, there's a lot of complexity. It's very solutions based in my view in terms of what customers are trying to do, but we don't really expect that to meaningfully come to fruition until early next year. But there's just a lot of tentacles and they're all different based on the stimulus package, and on the actual market that we're talking to. But again, I would just reiterate that this is something we do. It's frankly a core capability like working with partners. It's a core capability to understand in the federal, state and local, education, healthcare spaces where the funding is, what it means, what the deadlines are, and how to use it and then to basically walk our customers through it. But I know that was a long answer. I hope it was helpful.\nJim Suva: That was exactly where I was looking for. Thank you so much.\nChris Leahy: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question on the line comes from Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley. Katy, your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: [Indiscernible] backlog commentary. Can you talk about the gap between net sales growth and orders or writing growth in 3Q and maybe how that compared to the second quarter? Then I have a follow-up.\nAl Miralles: Sure. Hi, Katie. Good morning. This is Al. Look, we won't quote the exact delta there, but I think it's safe to say that we continue to see strong written demand and that continues to show up and that's part of what bolsters our confidence. Certainly shipments have lagged that. And again, I'll go back to my comment. I would say the mix looks like second quarter did, and that would be consistent across products with the one caveat. That, as we mentioned, Solutions was a little bit stronger, a little worse than it was in Q2.\nKaty Huberty: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up for you. The ending cash balance of $245 million is lower than your typical buffer. Can you just talk about your term to rebuild that buffer and also defund the Sirius acquisition? Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Sure. So first on the Sirius acquisition, I think we mentioned on the previous call, we have committed financing in place. So we expect that we are going to finance the acquisitions fully. From a cash balance perspective, I think Katy, if you compare it to where we were at the end of the year and maybe a year ago, certainly we would look lower. And a couple of things there. 1. We had debt refinancing or financing, I should say, in 2021. So that bolstered that cash position. And then notably for 2021, we've used a fair amount of cash for the existing acquisitions we've had, as well as share repurchases. So I think the combination of where we sit from a cash balance and our revolver availability perspective, we feel quite good with where we stand. And then we feel quite good about our ability to create and generate free cash flow in 2022.\nKaty Huberty: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Sheerin, Stifel. Matthew please go ahead.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes. Thanks and good morning. Chris I wanted to ask about the strong cloud growth that you're seeing, particularly infrastructure as a service. And I'm wondering if some of that is positively impacted by the fact that customers maybe moving or accelerating towards the cloud because of the product in -- and infrastructure, you know, on - prem product shortages. Are you seeing any of that in terms of customers saying maybe now is the time to move because we don't want to wait?\nChris Leahy: Yeah Matt. Great question. We've been asking ourselves that as well and talking to customers about it, given the kind of pervasive and persistent nature of the supply chain and the fact that It continues to extend. I would say -- I would characterize it this way, customers are rethinking and considering accelerating some movements to cloud and potentially re - architecting some of their solutions and more -- in a public cloud like environment versus, for example, on prem cloud. But what I wouldn't -- what I wouldn't characterize it as is just a wholesale shift. Customers are still very strategic in how they think about both flexibility obviously and scalability but also cost. And if you combine all of those things together, they're still looking for the absolute best solution and therefore, not just doing the wholesale shift. So I guess the answer would be, we are having this conversations. We're seeing some decisions made around accelerating to public cloud, but I wouldn't say that it's [Indiscernible] and wholesale, if that helps.\nMatthew Sheerin: I got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the PC shortages, particularly on the commercial side. What are your thoughts there in terms of the PC cycle? Are you seeing any early signs of adoption of Win 10, and do you see that as a driver going forward?\nChris Leahy: Well, look, I wouldn't say that, I've seen necessarily early adoption just yet, but as is always the case, there will be early adopters and there will be later adopters. And they will be our customers, so we'll help them through that. You all are familiar with the end of life for Win 10 and then the timing for Win 11 around the 2024, 20-25 time period. So it will be a driver, it's not been a driver yet. I think PCs generally, you've heard me say, I continue to believe in PC s. I think that we have more PC density now we're going to see sort of replacement cycles of PCs for a couple of reasons. Wear and tear, but also the technology improves at a faster pace and client devices are more and more important to the productivity of the people using them. You also have used cases that are expanding. And the hybrid work model obviously is really driving PCs. And so we will -- we feel good about PC growth and win 11 will certainly be a driver of that at some point over probably a couple of year period.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan. Samik, your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee : Great. Thank you. Chris, I just wanted to start off and go back to your comments. You mentioned this a couple of times now about monitoring the SMB segment for economic activity just given the increase in cases, etc. and you mentioned you haven't seen any sizable impact yet. But is there something more on a regional basis when you look at -- across the U.S. or maybe in some international markets on a more regional, specific places you're seeing any changes in activity from your customers where maybe there is a stronger correlation to how cases are trending. Any insights on that, and I have a follow-up, please.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, sure. Here's what I would say about the current environment. We're watching it, as is everybody, and we're cautious about it. And we put it in the category of wildcard because I don't know that anybody knows what's going to happen, but we all also know there has been more momentum around that vaccination availability at lower ages, antivirals, the rate of vaccine, particularly when we think of our location [Indiscernible]. We're thinking and investing for getting back to a robust environment and economy, and we're thinking forward. So I think a little bit unlike going into last year's winter months where there -- the cautiousness I would say was on a really high level. We're just feeling customers saying, we've got to invest. And so until early next year or work from [Indiscernible] that is I would say ubiquitous. So we -- in 2020, we talked about the uneven [Indiscernible] certain industries, etc. I just feel like the tone has really changed to the platform of \"We got to get back. We got to get back. We got to build for the future. \" So that's what we're seeing.\nSamik Chatterjee : Okay. A quick follow-up for that. I think you're indicating that the operating margin 3Q doesn't repeat in 4Q any incremental spend coming through. How much of [Indiscernible] mentioned some of the catch-up on SG&A versus [Indiscernible] what you outlined as is the right time to spend, and I'm just trying to think of what portion of that incremental spend should I be annualizing for the next year? Thank you.\nAl Miralles: So look, in fourth-quarter, we'll get more guidance with respect to what that looks like for 2022 and reflective of our combination with Sirius, right? So but let me focus my comments on fourth quarter. I would say the non-GAAP SG&A spend is just an unevenness or a timing effect of that spend. in Q3. That probably lagged a bit in Q4. We'd expect that to pick up. There's probably a component there, as we think about the Sirius combination, we're thinking more broadly about what that combination looks like, and how does that ultimately impact our investment spend. That being said, we're going to continue forward in Q4 with the efforts that we've been focused on, notably our own digital transformation, as well as to continue invest in the high-growth Solutions and Services areas.\nSamik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Welcome.\nOperator: The final question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, your line is open.\nKeith Housum: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hey, Chris, I'm just kind of thinking here through the investments that companies make -- are making in technology based on the supply chain insurers that they are, is there a willingness of your customers to move to another solutions that are hardware solution that can be fulfilled by the end of the year? Because the thinking is, a lot of these companies have IT budgets they want to spend anyways. So there's always a project wish that they want to do. Are people willing to convert to other projects in order to spend that money? Or are they holding onto the products available?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Good morning, a great question and I think it really depends frequently on the customer set. Small businesses have always been more nimble and less tied to particular requirements, and we have seen success there. And I think in my prepared remarks, supply chain constraints didn't impact them as much as in corporate because we could help them find alternatives. When you really don't want to shift off of them, it creates more work, frankly, within the organization. What we've [Indiscernible] We have worked with our customers to get in-line earlier. So a lot of customers are -- have been working very hard [Indiscernible] you typically would in hope s that they will get the product by year end. All that said, anywhere that there are I'll say mission less than mission-critical, by technologies that we can help them find alternatives. Whether it's a brand, whether it is the Cloud, whether it's something else that they can be using, you can bet we're doing it. But you're absolutely right, there's going to be a lot of pressure as we go into the back end of the year to get that product out. And we expect we'll be able to help them do it.\nKeith Housum: Got you. There is a follow-up here. In terms of the shortages that you're experiencing, are you finding that those shortages over this quarter, I guess sort of previous solution sets or is it really kind of game of whack-a-mole where it gets fixed in one area but a new [Indiscernible]?\nChris Leahy: Well, here's -- I said this before, you get this kind of supply chain ecosystem. And so you've got -- you have capacity, you got components, you got logistics, you got labor, you've got all of this impacting the ability to get product. And it has kind of shifted through the course of the year. What we've had on the transactional side, notebook and video and monitors and things like that, that have been constrained. Chromebook have started to ease up a little. That's planning a good 13 months ago to get -- get to that point by the OEM. What we saw [Indiscernible] this year in the past quarter and a little before was solutions product now being more constrained. And we mentioned Netcom in particular and storage in particular. So that is a problem when things are moving around, particularly when what customers need are comprehensive and holistic solutions, not just piece [Indiscernible]. So whack-a-mole is a good word for -- or a good term for it.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions registered on the lines. We'll hand the call back to Chris Leahy to conclude the call.\nChris Leahy: Bethany, Thank you. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our co-workers around the globe and [Indiscernible] all of CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. And to our investors and analysts [Indiscernible] attending this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with an overview of third quarter results and drivers of performance. Al will take you then through a more detailed look at our financials, as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as we always try to do to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. But before I get started, I do want to pause for a moment to honor the life and legacy of our former CEO, Tom Richards, who passed away last week after a valiant fight with cancer. I suspect most of you on this call have likely met Tom in-person. I'm certain that everyone on this call has been impacted by Tom. He was a fierce competitor and equally a kind human being. Tom had a lot of what we like to call it CDW Tomism. Simple ways of getting to the essence of something in a way that it stuck. One of my personal favorites is when Tom used to say, At CDW, we take what we do seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. That's the essence of who we are. That is our CDW culture. Captured those simply and amplified those strongly, by Tom Richards. Tom also had an unexpected way of signing off on our earnings calls, usually with a right comment about an upcoming holiday, like Halloween or Mother's Day, or even Valentine's Day. As a result, we always ended these calls on a high note and with a chuckle. Tom knew his audience well. In honor of Tom, I'd like to kick off this earnings call with the tagline he penned on every communication to a co-worker. Tom always signed off with \"you make a difference. \" Literally injecting into each co-worker Tom's personal belief in them, and their important impact. On behalf of all of our coworkers around the globe, our customers and our partners, our communities and our investors, I would like to say thank you to Tom. You made a difference. Let me turn now to Q3 performance. Once again, CDW posted strong top-line growth and profitability. Overall, demand was strong and the teams did a great job addressing customer needs.  For the quarter we delivered record net sales of $5.311 billion, 0.4% higher than last year, and up 10.7% in constant-currency, non-GAAP operating income of $435 million up 12.6% and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.13, 13.4% higher than last year on a reported basis and up 15.8% in constant-currency. Our ability to deliver this strong top line and profitability was the result of 3 key drivers; our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio, and our ongoing execution against our three-part strategy, which is focused on taking share and investing in solutions and capabilities our customers need and want. Let me walk through each one of these and share some detail about how they contributed to our performance.  First, our balanced portfolio of customer and markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, healthcare, government, which includes federal and state and local customers, and education with K-12 and higher ed. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, each serving public and commercial customers. All of these operations represent meaningful businesses in their own way. Often, different factors impact these diverse customer end markets. And this quarter we saw that play out as our commercial business in the U.S. are small on corporate channels. And our international operations posted significant double-digit increases, while our U.S. public business posted a mid-single-digit decline. From a macro perspective, supply remained under pressure this quarter. Demand outpaced supply and lead times extended particularly in several solutions areas. The team continued to leverage our distribution centers, expensive logistics capabilities, keep vendor partner relationships, and strong Balance Sheet, and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. They did an exceptional job working with our partners to stay on top of availability status. Our sellers and technical specialists also worked with customers and whenever possible, found alternative available product and built alternative solutions. These efforts helped mitigate some of the pressure and our backlog increase was consistent with last quarter. The tight supply environment continued to impact prices, which our teams were generally able to pass along. Let's take a deeper look at third quarter customer and market performance. Commercial customer priorities remain the same as in the second quarter, digital transformation, security, and hybrid and cloud solutions. Customers continue to prioritize investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations to strengthen and secure infrastructure platform and endpoints. Within this backdrop, corporate increased 25% and customer demand remained strong. While many customers delayed return to office, they continued to prepare as well as invest to facilitate hybrid work.  This drove ongoing strong double-digit increases in transactions propelled by notebooks, audio visual, and desktop. At the same time, digital transformation remains a top priority. While buying sentiment was clearly there, in many cases, the product was not. Writings were strong, but with extended lead time, backlog built during the quarter. Lack of product availability, particularly in Netcom and storage, muted corporate solutions growth. Small business also delivered another exceptional quarter of growth, increasing almost 40%. The team continued to help customers with remote enablement, security, and video, driving strong growth across both transactional and solutions categories. As we have shared previously, small business customers tend to be more flexible in their technology requirements. So while they did see some impact from supply constraints, small business did not experience as much at corporate. A great example of the power of diverse end markets.  You also see the power of our diverse end markets in our public performance. Net sales for our government channels decreased 33%. federal declines double-digit in large part due to the overlapping of our devices in Service Solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other clients advice programs that were particularly strong last year. Security remains robust with net sales up more than 30%. The gears of Washington were slower than typical at federal year-end, and we had contracting delays in several large contracts. This is not unusual, given the magnitude of federal contracts, timing can influence performance. You've heard us talk about federal lumpy nature in the past. This will unwind and we expect to see a reversal back to growth in the first half of 2022. State and local posted a mid-single-digit decline. Stimulus funding remained largely unallocated to the local level. This is because access to multi-year American Rescue Plan Act funding with deadlines in 2024, lead to greater focus on multi-year budget planning. At the same time, state and local customers were focused on digesting last year's meaningful stimulus funded IT investments. We continue to work with our customers, but given the complexity of the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing, we do not expect to see projects moving ahead meaningfully until early 2022. Education increased by 2%. Higher Ed delivered high single-digit growth driven by ongoing focus on campus connectivity, and enhancing the dorm room experience with double-digit growth in both security software and servers. The K-12 team did an excellent job and matched last year's record net sales, coming in flat on top of last year's 30% plus growth.  This was consistent with the expectations we shared on our year-end 2020 call, where we looked for strong non-seasonal first-half performance to be followed by a deceleration in the second half. Chromebook availability continued to improve during the quarter, and client devices increased low single-digits on top of last year's stimulant equity and access driven growth. Overall, transactions increased low single-digits on top of last year's strong double-digit growth. Solutions declined driven by a double-digit decline in Netcom largely reflecting supply challenges. We continue to expect above historical net sales against some very tough unseasonal fourth quarter compares. Healthcare posted a 31% increase. By the second wave of COVID, staff shortages and limited ICU bed availability during the quarter, some projects that had been sidelined did resume.  This was particularly the case in security as healthcare remains a target for cybercrime. Our security experts continue to guide hospital systems to find the best solutions that protect their sensitive data and security sales increased strong double-digits. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations increased over 30% on a reported basis. Both the UK and Canada delivered mid-20% growth in local currency. Customer priorities in both markets remain the same as the U.S. Digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions, as do their investments to enable the future and add resiliency to their operations. Both operations experienced increased back-orders. Clearly, the 11% plus sales growth we delivered, demonstrates the power of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. It also demonstrates the power of the second driver of our performance [Indiscernible] this quarter, the breadth of our products and solutions portfolio, which you can see in our major category performance.  Transactions increased low double-digits driven by client device growth in video. Solutions were flat with double-digit increases in servers and collaboration. Once again, increased [Indiscernible] from double-digit. We saw robust growth across all 3 top cloud workloads, security, infrastructure as-a-service, and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. And once again, given [Indiscernible] importance to our customers, our security practice delivered at first [Indiscernible] was up strong double-digits. Our teams continue to guide customers on their security posture. Assess the environment, design the best approach, and deploy and manage the solutions throughout its lifecycle. Overall, for the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in hardware, low-single-digit growth in software, and strong double-digit growth in services. Software net sales increased low-single-digit, strong double-digit increase in security software, database software, and backup, and recovery were partially offset by declines in network management, software storage, and telephony related software. As I have shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. This [Indiscernible] contribution and was driven by both professional and managed services. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, the impact of investments we are making in our three-part strategy for growth. As you know, in October, we announced our planned acquisition of Sirius Computer Solutions. When we announced the acquisition, I shared how it deepens and adds scale to our services capabilities. Capabilities that will ensure we remain the trusted technology advisor to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation. Notice EBITDA deepens, Sirius is additive to our existing capabilities.  Capabilities we have built for both organic and inorganic investments. Capabilities that enable us to serve customers as their trusted advisor, whether in a physical, digital, or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally. Why so many investments in services capabilities? Simply put, services are becoming an increasingly larger component of total customer IT spend. For CDW services position us to enable the whole solution, increase our engagement with customers and stickiness, and provide insight into opportunities to further help our customers across the full IP life cycle. Today, IT leaders are accountable for both running -- to both run the business and transform it, leaders need to invest resources where they can have the greatest impact. And do so with the greatest speed. Services are critical to making this happen. To address this full-stack and full lifecycle, our technical organization has grown to more than 3,700 pre -sale specialists and engineers.  Today, we can deliver complex digital [Indiscernible] let me share an example of how our services team is helping the global online home retailer transform their business for their next wave of growth. Experience from [Indiscernible] customer opt is for a combination of [Indiscernible] public cloud technologies and new cloud-native plant -- pattern. This would create the agility they needed [Indiscernible] environment. A great idea, but accelerating cloud technology requires specialized expertise that is inefficient to keep on staff, and that is for CDW payment. First we leveraged our cloud managed services and offloaded some of the cloud projects from the customer to CDW. Then we pulled in our digital velocity talents orchestration services for DVT. DVT orchestration supplies customers with talent to work inside the customer's existing team, Talent that is becoming more and more vital in today's environment. Digital velocity, talent, orchestration delivers highly vetted resources, whether already employed by CDW or sourced by us.  CDW services, enabled the solution. But it did so much more. As you can imagine, this level of high touch integration creates customer loyalty with ongoing relationships on the ground, and continued exchange between CDW and the customer, ultimately leading to more business. Great for the customer, and great for CDW. This is an excellent example of our three-part strategy in action and how M&A enhances our organic investments to ensure we remain our customer's number one choice as a trusted advisor. Solving key business problems for our customer in today's environment requires strong service and solutions capabilities. Capabilities that when combined with our great relationships and competitive advantages of skill, scope, and disciplined execution, enable us to win in the marketplace and deliver sustainable, profitable growth today and in the future.  And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. We continue to look for growth in 2021 to come in between 9 and 1/4% and 10% in [Indiscernible] report currency. Split roughly between 5% IT market growth and 425 to 500 basis points to CDW market outperformance. This reflects our expectation that supply constraints do not mitigate anytime in the near future, but do not get materially worse. Remember these constraints don't just reflect component shortages, but also labor and logistics challenges, challenges we do not expect to reverse in the near-term, and challenges that we do not expect to resolve at the flush, but rather gradually. As far as wildcards, in addition to the fluid supply situation and the potential for another wave of COVID, given the slowdown in the third quarter GDP growth, we will keep a watchful eye out for any slowdown in the economy. As we do, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out execute our competition. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place. A strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro or customer-specific challenges and positions us for sustainable growth. A strategy designed to continue our evolution as the leading IT solutions provider. And most importantly, a strategy that delivers profitable growth and returns to shareholders.  This confidence underpins today's action by our board to increase our quarterly cash dividend by 25%. I know many of you may be wondering what we expect for next year. We're in the middle of our planning process, and as we always do, we'll provide our outlook for 2022 on our year-end conference call. And with that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Al. Good morning, Adam. Thanks for the question. And you know, we're in a little bit of a quiet period here as we go through the various regulatory approvals. That said, one of the areas that we focused very quickly was feedback, and I would just tell you, it's been really, really positive on both fronts. So our customers at CDW are delighted about the acquisition, and really looking forward to the combined entity and the capabilities that they helped bolster CDW, given their reputation in the market and the quality of their services and the reciprocal is true as well. I talked to Joe Martin late in the day of the announcement, and he had made his way through a lot of customers as had their front-line sellers, and it was for the most part all positive. So again, we think that -- I said the word before, a home-run deal and we're going to make it work really well, and our customers seem to be excited, our partners equally are thrilled. It 's exactly what they were looking for us to do and they are thrilled. Well, you know, look, they're doing just fine and there are customers like us in areas like Federal, which we talked about today, or enterprise customers. And as you know, that can be a lumpy business. So when we did our diligence and looked at the pipeline and the types of programs they're running with customers they were having a similar impact that we were having with regard to our larger customers. Some things being delayed, some things being planned yet not -- not yet rolled out necessarily, particularly in terms of delays in going back to the office, etc. But I would tell you that we feel very confident, Adam, in the health of the business, in the prospects of the business in the pipeline for the business and in the opportunities for Sirius and CDW, the combined entity. Thanks, Adam. Yeah, I understand. And we'll share more with our -- about our planning next year as we think about it. Look, it feels like the perspective out there is maybe a little worse than transitory. And so we will just keep our eye on the economy and how this could impact in particular different segments of our business. For example, when you think about small business, they are really doing a terrific job right now, but we're keeping a very close eye on that segment of the market to understand how the economy might be impacting them, where their optimism is, their ability to hire, etc. So as we always do, we'll keep an eye on it. It feels a little worse than transitory but again, we think that technology is an A1 priority, and our customers will continue to invest in technology if in fact, it becomes a little more extent that we think they'll keep the priority there. And look, if we can keep the economy coming out of the pandemic with the momentum we seem to be building and positive nature in the economy, we're feeling pretty good. Good morning Rupplu and thanks for reminding the team of the great performance, they will appreciate that. Look, you know, we called this out earlier in the year and I mentioned it again, in our prepared -- my prepared remarks. But it's really been unseasonal and we expected to see the first half of this year be quite [Indiscernible] we're lapping a big back half of the year, that we would expect to still continue to see, I'll call it solid performance, and it's a bit unseasonal because it's the end of the year. But if we need to [Indiscernible] in our view, and it's going to be -- it'll be difficult to overcome the level of growth that we saw last year. That said Rupplu, if the stimulus funding, for example the emergency connectivity [Indiscernible] is yet another source of funds for education institutions to be able to fortify their classrooms since hybrid environment. The one thing with that funding is schools are able to use it for orders that are placed that we're working our way through.  What of that money relates to orders that have been placed? We're confident that there is a large portion that are additive to the base. And again, the team, as they always do, has done a phenomenal job helping our k-12 customers work through that funding. So as you've heard me say before, I feel very confident in education over the long term. It is a growth area. The education market has inflection points and we have always been ahead of those inflection points. Whether it's how the classroom itself changes, whether it's going to hybrid, whatever those are, we are usually there and I'll tell you, Amplified IT, which we just added is taking us to yet another [Indiscernible] level with their cloud-enabled capabilities and their IT developed technology that they offer for classrooms. So I'll pass you [Indiscernible] here, but the team is doing very well, a long-term growth area. There's many different segments so let me start. I think where -- you were going there. Yeah, It's complicated, right. We've got the supply ecosystem that is -- it has some impact to it right now so we're trying to manage through all of that. Here's what I'd say about K-through-12. You know, we have a lot of experience understanding funding, stimulus funding, and other types of funding for educational institutions. So we sit side-by-side with our customers to make sure they understand both where the dollars can be used, for what products in particular, or for what outcomes, because sometimes it's outcome-based? And what the deadlines are, and what those deadlines mean? Do you have to have the product in-house, do you have to have the product order placed? So there's a lot of navigating that's going on, and I feel highly confident that the team is doing a phenomenal job with our customers and that our K-12 customers are not going to lose out on any funding.  That's really clear. in the state and local space where we've got stimulus funding coming down. It's been a bit complicated because the funding packages, there were 3 of them as we've talked about before, the CARES Act package, for example, had a deadline at the end of this coming year, that was for March of last year. The end of last year, it was -- there was nothing for state and locals in the stimulus package. And then this March, there was a hefty amount. But as we all know when it comes to state and local, it's about budget cycles and it's about funding deadline. So the spending that's taken place in 2021, is primarily from the CARES package with a deadline this year. What we're seeing now is -- I don't want to call it slowing down, but I'm going to say a moderating and planning, and state and local governments now have that funding where they don't have to spend it till the end of 2024.  And so they are now looking at a multiyear approach. Pretty unusual, this multiyear approach but that's what they're doing. And we're helping them with it, there's a lot of complexity. It's very solutions based in my view in terms of what customers are trying to do, but we don't really expect that to meaningfully come to fruition until early next year. But there's just a lot of tentacles and they're all different based on the stimulus package, and on the actual market that we're talking to. But again, I would just reiterate that this is something we do. It's frankly a core capability like working with partners. It's a core capability to understand in the federal, state and local, education, healthcare spaces where the funding is, what it means, what the deadlines are, and how to use it and then to basically walk our customers through it. But I know that was a long answer. I hope it was helpful. You're welcome. Yeah Matt. Great question. We've been asking ourselves that as well and talking to customers about it, given the kind of pervasive and persistent nature of the supply chain and the fact that It continues to extend. I would say -- I would characterize it this way, customers are rethinking and considering accelerating some movements to cloud and potentially re - architecting some of their solutions and more -- in a public cloud like environment versus, for example, on prem cloud. But what I wouldn't -- what I wouldn't characterize it as is just a wholesale shift. Customers are still very strategic in how they think about both flexibility obviously and scalability but also cost. And if you combine all of those things together, they're still looking for the absolute best solution and therefore, not just doing the wholesale shift. So I guess the answer would be, we are having this conversations. We're seeing some decisions made around accelerating to public cloud, but I wouldn't say that it's [Indiscernible] and wholesale, if that helps. Well, look, I wouldn't say that, I've seen necessarily early adoption just yet, but as is always the case, there will be early adopters and there will be later adopters. And they will be our customers, so we'll help them through that. You all are familiar with the end of life for Win 10 and then the timing for Win 11 around the 2024, 20-25 time period. So it will be a driver, it's not been a driver yet. I think PCs generally, you've heard me say, I continue to believe in PC s. I think that we have more PC density now we're going to see sort of replacement cycles of PCs for a couple of reasons. Wear and tear, but also the technology improves at a faster pace and client devices are more and more important to the productivity of the people using them. You also have used cases that are expanding. And the hybrid work model obviously is really driving PCs. And so we will -- we feel good about PC growth and win 11 will certainly be a driver of that at some point over probably a couple of year period. Yeah, sure. Here's what I would say about the current environment. We're watching it, as is everybody, and we're cautious about it. And we put it in the category of wildcard because I don't know that anybody knows what's going to happen, but we all also know there has been more momentum around that vaccination availability at lower ages, antivirals, the rate of vaccine, particularly when we think of our location [Indiscernible]. We're thinking and investing for getting back to a robust environment and economy, and we're thinking forward. So I think a little bit unlike going into last year's winter months where there -- the cautiousness I would say was on a really high level. We're just feeling customers saying, we've got to invest. And so until early next year or work from [Indiscernible] that is I would say ubiquitous. So we -- in 2020, we talked about the uneven [Indiscernible] certain industries, etc. I just feel like the tone has really changed to the platform of \"We got to get back. We got to get back. We got to build for the future. \" So that's what we're seeing. Yeah. Good morning, a great question and I think it really depends frequently on the customer set. Small businesses have always been more nimble and less tied to particular requirements, and we have seen success there. And I think in my prepared remarks, supply chain constraints didn't impact them as much as in corporate because we could help them find alternatives. When you really don't want to shift off of them, it creates more work, frankly, within the organization. What we've [Indiscernible] We have worked with our customers to get in-line earlier. So a lot of customers are -- have been working very hard [Indiscernible] you typically would in hope s that they will get the product by year end. All that said, anywhere that there are I'll say mission less than mission-critical, by technologies that we can help them find alternatives. Whether it's a brand, whether it is the Cloud, whether it's something else that they can be using, you can bet we're doing it. But you're absolutely right, there's going to be a lot of pressure as we go into the back end of the year to get that product out. And we expect we'll be able to help them do it. Well, here's -- I said this before, you get this kind of supply chain ecosystem. And so you've got -- you have capacity, you got components, you got logistics, you got labor, you've got all of this impacting the ability to get product. And it has kind of shifted through the course of the year. What we've had on the transactional side, notebook and video and monitors and things like that, that have been constrained. Chromebook have started to ease up a little. That's planning a good 13 months ago to get -- get to that point by the OEM. What we saw [Indiscernible] this year in the past quarter and a little before was solutions product now being more constrained. And we mentioned Netcom in particular and storage in particular. So that is a problem when things are moving around, particularly when what customers need are comprehensive and holistic solutions, not just piece [Indiscernible]. So whack-a-mole is a good word for -- or a good term for it. Bethany, Thank you. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our co-workers around the globe and [Indiscernible] all of CDW stakeholders. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. And to our investors and analysts [Indiscernible] attending this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Have a good day."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with more detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with the 2021 outlook. Turning to our third quarter P&L on slide 8, consolidated net sales were $5.3 billion, up 11.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.7% Net sales and channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year, corporate, small business, and international continue to rebound. Posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter and delivering sales above 2019 levels. This quarter's growth also benefited from strong double-digit performance in healthcare, but was tempered by a slowdown in education and declining government. On the supply side, overall backlog increased several $100 million in the quarter and continues to be elevated year-over-year. The team did a great job leveraging CDW 's competitive advantages so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $915 million, an increase of 10.8% on a reported basis. Gross margin was 17.3%, down approximately 10 basis points versus last year. This is primarily driven by lower product margin, partially offset by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily in softwares and service, in addition to strong professional and managed services performance. Turning to SG&A on slide 9, non-GAAP SG&A increased 9.2%. increases primarily driven by payroll costs, including sales compensation, which moves with gross profit growth, and performance-based compensation, consistent with higher attainment against financial goals. Finally, it reflects investments in the business, including increased co-worker counts, focused on execution of our strategy.  Co-worker count at the end of the third quarter was 11,098, up 432 from the second quarter, and 1118 over prior year. The increase in co-worker count reflects organic and organic -- inorganic investments to support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. GAAP operating income was $386 million, up 21.6%. non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $435 million up 12.6% And non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.2%. Moving to slide 10, interest expense was $36 million down 9.4%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year's refinancing. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 23.9%. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we just taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs as shown on Slide 12.  For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.3% up 200 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to a onetime impact of state and foreign tax benefits recognized in the prior year. As you can see on slide 13, the second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of a $139 million, GAAP net income per share was a $1.91, up 43.2%. Our non-GAAP net income was $298 million in the quarter up 12.3%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.13, up 16.4% from last year. Turning to year-to-date results in slides 14 through 19, net sales were $15 billion, an increase of 13.1% on a reported basis, and 13.7% on an average daily sales basis. We had one fewer selling day year-to-date in 2021, which will be made up in Q4, we have one extra selling day compared to the prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, year-to-date consolidated net sales were 12.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $2.6 billion up 11.3% and gross profit margin was 17% down approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Operating income was roughly $1.1 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 billion up 18.7%. Net income was $773 million and non-GAAP net income was $834 million up 20.7%. non-GAAP net income per share was $5.89, up 23.5%. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 20, at September 30th, cash and cash equivalents were $245 million, and net debt was $3.8 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion.  Year-to-date free cash flow was $341 million as shown on slide 21. This is lighter than last year's record, $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and one time items. Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. Additionally, working capital increased to support our strong year-to-date growth, and we continue to make strategic investments in inventory to support our customers through this choppy supply environment. Moving to slide 22, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 25 days, up 9 days from last year's third quarter. Increase was primarily driven by mixing out of vendors with longer payment cycles, in addition to holding customer-driven stocking positions, and the timing of receipts and shipments. Turning to capital allocation on slide 23, our 2021 priorities remain the same. First, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP Net Income, including today's 25% increase to the dividend.  The increased annual dividend of $2 is approximately 25% of trailing 12-month non-GAAP Net Income through September. The Q4 2021 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power, and cash flow generation of the business. It marks the 8th consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013. Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 36% from its initial level. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio going forward, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, we ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the third quarter at 2.3 times. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Sirius, which we announced on October 18th, and our recent Focal Point and Amplified IT acquisitions are great examples.  And fourth, we return excess cash after dividends and M&A, to shareholders through share repurchases. During the quarter, we continued to deploy cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $505 million to shareholders, including $55 million in dividends and $450 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $188 per share. We continue to expect to return approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders for the full-year of 2021, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Going forward, we continue to execute against our capital allocation priorities as we have done since 2014. In 2022, post closing of the Sirius acquisition, we expect to have an initial net leverage ratio of approximately 3.3 times. While our capital allocation priorities will remain the same, we will shift our objectives to focus on paying the dividend and reducing debt. As a result of this focus, we'll put a lower priority on M&A and share repurchases until our net leverage is in our target range of 2.5 to 3 times, which we expect to achieve by the end of 2022. We continue to expect to close the Sirius acquisition in December, and we intend to share additional thoughts on the financial impacts of consolidating Sirius into CDW on our fourth quarter call. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on slide 24. Supply and product lead times remain fluid, making it challenging to comprehensively forecast the high degree of confidence.  On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with both U.S. and international commercial customers. On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Constraints continue to notebooks, desktops, video, Netcom, and data center categories, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call. We do not expect it to improve in the near future. With that context for full-year 2021, we continue to expect the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5% and our net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the U.S. IT market in constant currency. This assumes a consistent supply chain environment and impact to our backlog.  We feel good about the health of the business, and we continue to navigate the fluid supply environment. We continue to expect currency to contribute in an approximately 80 basis points the full-year net sales growth, assuming exchange rates of a $1.38, the British pound and $0.80 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we now expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the high 7% range for full-year 2021, as you've heard us say, we believe now is the time to invest in the business and expect investments made in the fourth quarter to drive an operating margin which will deliver our full-year outlook. Putting it all together, we now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the high teens, call it 18% plus or minus 25 basis points. Currency is expected to contribute an additional 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. For free cash flow, our long-term rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.5% of net sales, assuming current tax rates.  However, given the timing impacts that contributed 2020's significant over delivery and ongoing customer-driven stocking positions, as well as the time of receipts and shipments, we expect 2021 free cash flow to come in slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts and the components of free cash flow, including capital expenditures, and the cash conversion cycle, can also be found on slide 25. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator open up for questions, and we would just please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yeah. Good morning Shannon. This is Al. So a couple of things that I would note. So going in in the quarter, we maybe would have expected that there would be a bit of a kind of a modest view of backlog. I'd say overall for the quarter was a bit more than modest. And let's call it, in terms of just all characteristics, similar to Q2. A couple of variants or components that maybe looked a little different, and I think Chris touched on this in your prepared remarks, is that we saw a bit more of an effect from a solutions perspective and that would have included notably Netcom and storage. Notwithstanding that similar to Q2. And look, I would just note the -- all things considered, the team did an exceptional job navigating through that and delivering on the results. We are not. I would just note the look. I think there's component in the backlog that there's likely some pull-forward, right? It's been a tenuous environment and so there are customers that I think probably have a perspective that knowing that this doesn't have an clear end date. [Indiscernible] maybe get in front of some of their projects, and so there's probably component that's pulled forward. We're not feeling the effects, or seeing the effects of either double bookings. Yes. Sure. And thanks for the question, Rupplu. So I think you just hit it at the end there. Look, there are -- there are lots of puts and takes in any given quarter, and I will just start, if you just put aside the supply chain environment, right? Mix does really matter. So if we think about components, what's transactional, what solutional from a mix perspective that matters, channel mix matters, all those things have an impact, I'll say to start on your gross margin and obviously then the kinda, the dropdown from an operating margin perspective. So let's just keep that in mind. And again, kind of supply chain will matter as well. In the case of this particular quarter and maybe as an example.  So there -- in terms of mix there, that is a little bit less public mix from a channel perspective. And then you have got -- you've got transactional solution [Indiscernible]. And then very notably Rupplu, I will just note the fact that your 100% gross margin items will have an impact in this quarter. Our 100% gross margin items grew faster than our net sales. So that's going to have an impact as well. And so again, all of that steeped in focus on gross margin. Then finally, if we walk that down operating margin, it 's been just a matter of the -- at what pace are -- is our non-GAAP [Indiscernible] SG&A spend happening. In the case of this quarter, I would say our non-GAAP SG&A spend lagged some of that growth in gross profit, and so we dropped more to the operating margin for the quarter.  And when you look to our outlook relative to what that operating margin was for this quarter, we're up and it's going to balance this back up to a high 7s on the operating margin. As you look forward, look, I think you've got a good sense for this strategy and the movement in where we're going longer-term in terms of mixing into services and mixing in on a 100% gross margin. But all those mix components will manner as we go forward. Sure. Hi, Katie. Good morning. This is Al. Look, we won't quote the exact delta there, but I think it's safe to say that we continue to see strong written demand and that continues to show up and that's part of what bolsters our confidence. Certainly shipments have lagged that. And again, I'll go back to my comment. I would say the mix looks like second quarter did, and that would be consistent across products with the one caveat. That, as we mentioned, Solutions was a little bit stronger, a little worse than it was in Q2. Sure. So first on the Sirius acquisition, I think we mentioned on the previous call, we have committed financing in place. So we expect that we are going to finance the acquisitions fully. From a cash balance perspective, I think Katy, if you compare it to where we were at the end of the year and maybe a year ago, certainly we would look lower. And a couple of things there. 1. We had debt refinancing or financing, I should say, in 2021. So that bolstered that cash position. And then notably for 2021, we've used a fair amount of cash for the existing acquisitions we've had, as well as share repurchases. So I think the combination of where we sit from a cash balance and our revolver availability perspective, we feel quite good with where we stand. And then we feel quite good about our ability to create and generate free cash flow in 2022. So look, in fourth-quarter, we'll get more guidance with respect to what that looks like for 2022 and reflective of our combination with Sirius, right? So but let me focus my comments on fourth quarter. I would say the non-GAAP SG&A spend is just an unevenness or a timing effect of that spend. in Q3. That probably lagged a bit in Q4. We'd expect that to pick up. There's probably a component there, as we think about the Sirius combination, we're thinking more broadly about what that combination looks like, and how does that ultimately impact our investment spend. That being said, we're going to continue forward in Q4 with the efforts that we've been focused on, notably our own digital transformation, as well as to continue invest in the high-growth Solutions and Services areas. Welcome."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Brittany. I will begin this morning with an overview of second quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at the financials and capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks as always to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. We had a record second quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW\u2019s business model and strategy. For the second quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, a quarterly record in our first quarter over $5 billion of net sales. Net sales grew 17.9% above last year on a reported and average daily sales basis and up 16.3% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 18.2% to $883 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $418 million, an increase of 23.6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% on a reported basis and up 27.9% in constant currency. Our outstanding results reflect our team\u2019s extraordinary execution and the importance of our scale, industry experience and knowledge and strong customer relationships. The diversity of our customer end markets and breadth of our solutions portfolio continues to serve us well. Our record second quarter performance reflected a rebound in commercial customer spending, driving excellent results in our corporate small business and Canada segments and continued strength in our education channel. Our results reflect strong momentum across our business as technology spending recovers from lower spending last year and also increased demand as customers seek to modernize, optimize and innovate. In 2020, customers prioritize remote enablement and continuity. So far in 2021, customers have prioritized digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions as well as continued investments in endpoint solutions, driving strong growth for solutions and transactions. Customers are investing to enable the future and adding resilience into their operations, strengthening and securing infrastructure, platforms and endpoints, leveraging the cloud, preparing for return to in-person operations and industrializing remote enablement for permanently changed work models. We have combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and new logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. Our scale and strong financial position enabled us to continue helping customers navigate the choppy supply environment. As we previewed on our last earnings call, supply challenges increased during the second quarter for many transactional products and some infrastructure products. While riding strengthened as economies rebounded and more customers turn to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and lifecycle, our backlog increased compared to the first quarter. Another impact in the tight supply environment was increasing prices, which our teams were generally able to pass on. We expect supply constraints to continue through the second half of the year and into next year. Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the second quarter customer end market performance. Corporate increased 27% as customer spend sharply recovered with strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers remain focused on digital transformation, hybrid and cloud and security. Customers also began to prepare for employees to return to the office in the coming months, driving endpoint solutions, including notebooks, video and accessory growth. Our corporate backlog increased during the quarter as customers await availability due to standards requirements and generally larger orders. Small Business delivered exceptional growth, growing 60%, yes, 6-0 percent as optimism improved and hiring increased. Our team helps customers with remote enablement, security and video, leading to strong growth in both transactional and solution spend. As we have shared previously, Small Business customers tend to be nimbler in their technology requirements. So, performance was less impacted by supply constraints. Net sales for our government channel decreased 29%. Federal declined double-digits due to overlapping our device-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other client device programs that were strong last year. State & Local decreased mid single-digits. Customers evaluated their needs at the beginning of the quarter and started to make investments utilizing stimulus funding towards the end of the quarter, making timing versus demand more of a driver of performance. Our education channel grew 27%. The team delivered another $1 billion plus quarter with strong double-digit growth from both K-12 and higher ed. K-12 and higher ed customers are focused on investments to support equity and access and to enhance the in-classroom experience as schools prepare for students to return this fall, which drove both strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers continue to turn to us for our holistic capabilities across technology solutions and our deep education experience. Healthcare increased 7%, returning to year-over-year growth. Customers resumed projects that have been sidelined during the pandemic as budgets reopened driven by patients returning for elective procedures and providers made investments for the future. Growth was balanced between transactional and solutions categories. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, UK net sales decreased low single-digits overlapping strong public sector performance and reflecting a slower commercial recovery. The Canada team drove strong double-digit growth in local currency, powered by commercial customer strength and strong transactional and solutions performance. Our second quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. Transactions increased strong double-digits driven by client device growth of 17% as well as strong growth in video and accessories. Solutions also increased strong double-digits driven by software, collaboration tools and data center solutions. This led to balanced double-digit growth across hardware, software and services. Our services growth reflects strong organic performance and inorganic contributions. As I have shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double-digits across all customer segments driven by robust growth in security, infrastructure-as-a-service and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue and we are well-positioned to deliver. I want to take a moment to highlight our security process given its importance to our customers as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double-digits as customers improved their security frameworks to respond to increasing threats. Our teams help customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation. Our second quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. They are all important drivers of our past and future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extent of products, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers\u2019 total needs across the sector of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. Technology has become more essential to our customers and we are best positioned to help them navigate the complexity. And the final driver of our performance, our three-part strategy for growth, which is to: first, acquire new customers and actual share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action. Earlier this week, we announced that we acquired Focal Point. Focal Point is a leading provider of cybersecurity services with deep capabilities in identity and access management as well as the ability to serve customers across the full cybersecurity landscape. Focal Point is a leader in the cybersecurity space with an expert team and complementary customer relationships. As I have shared earlier, security is a top focus area for our customers. The addition of Focal Point expands and accelerates our security practice, adding over 200 coworkers who we welcome to CDW. We see many significant opportunities ahead and this is a great example of adding capability to help customers across the full technology solution stack and full technology lifecycle. We view M&A as an important part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDW\u2019s strategic capabilities. Our success is a testament to our coworkers, including those who joined CDW through acquisition, who have delivered consistent with the strategic rationale of each deal, delivering tremendous value to our customers. Let me share another example. Over the last year, education customers have embraced technology more than ever and fundamentally changed how they purchased with districts and school systems banding together to access stimulus programs and procure technology to enable remote hybrid and in-person model. A long-time higher ed customer who was transitioning from a decentralized technology program to centralized turned to us to provide a better end-user experience for its students and staff across its 20 plus campuses. Our team leveraged our digital capabilities to integrate directly into their systems. This greatly improved the ease of purchasing, providing configured branded bundles, hitting pre-negotiated pricing, direct-to-home logistics and product availability in a constrained environment. Our customer-first focus and logistical capabilities continue to be differentiators that drive value with our customers and vendor partners. This is a great example of how we leverage our competitive advantages win. Last, I want to share a story about a corporate customer that our team helps execute a global compute refresh, changing from a BYOD organization to corporate standards. The Director of Global IT service delivery leading the project has turned exclusively to us to partner on this important initiative for over 8,000 employees in 20 countries. Having a global partner was very important. Our teams in the US, UK and Canada worked closely together to deliver for the customer. We worked with our vendor partners to ensure we had product when the customer needed it, which is crucial in the current environment and the capability we have, given our partner relationships, strong financial position and distribution centers. What started as a device refresh has led to partnering on the customers\u2019 return to office initiative and technology enhancements as well as software and security projects, throwing the account from less than $1 million in net sales last year to over $7 million this year. Our team understood the customers\u2019 challenges and leveraged CDW\u2019s capabilities on a worldwide basis to provide outstanding service, leading to more opportunities. These examples highlight CDW\u2019s three-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the value of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I am so proud of the way our teams continued to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. During the quarter, our teams continued to safely reengage with customers and partners in-person. Although the environment is dynamic, groups of coworkers have started to return to our offices for key meetings and small events and others are starting to work more regularly in our offices. Our ReunITe team is working hard to thoughtfully re-imagine and orchestrate the future of work, so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can, while we continue to fortify our strong culture. Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are again increasing our outlook for both U.S. IT market growth and CDW\u2019s net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market to grow about 5% and our top line to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. For the third quarter, we expect customer demand trends to continue and have confidence in how our teams are executing and in our solutions and services portfolio. That said we remain cautious about the supply environment, which we expect to continue to be challenged. While there are other wildcards such as COVID variant, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. Technology is more essential to all sectors of the economy and will continue to play an increasingly important role in years ahead. We have great confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and outexecute our competition. Finally, let me take a moment to update you on our CFO transition. The process is progressing very well. I am really pleased with the caliber of candidates interested and excited about CDW. We will provide further updates once the process is complete. Until then, Collin is fully engaged and after his successor\u2019s name, we will remain on board to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I will turn it over to Collin.\nCollin Kebo: Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with more detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8, consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, up 17.9% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 16.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales increased more than $0.5 billion or 11.2%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 4.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were stronger than expected reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the rebound was sharper than expected in several channels, most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Corporate, Small Business and CDW Canada all delivered very healthy double-digit growth versus 2020 and are up versus 2019. So, the strong growth reflects more than easy comparisons. As Chris mentioned, education momentum continued, delivering the fourth consecutive quarter of over $1 billion of net sales. On the supply side, while the backlog increased several hundred million dollars in the second quarter, the team did a great job leveraging CDW\u2019s competitive advantages and supporting stronger than expected demand, so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $883 million, an increase of 18.2%. Gross margin was 17.2%, up approximately 10 basis points versus last year primarily driven by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily software-as-a-service and strong professional services performance, partially offset by overlapping higher margin configuration services for the Census project last year. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9, non-GAAP SG&A increased 13.6%. The increase was primarily driven by payroll costs, including sales compensation, which moves with gross profit growth; performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals; and investments in the business, including coworker count to drive our strategy. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was 10,666. Coworker count increased 480 from the first quarter and 618 from the prior year. The increase in coworker count reflects organic and inorganic investments to support high growth solution areas and our digital transformation. GAAP operating income was $370 million, up 30.5%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $418 million, up 23.6%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.1%. Moving to Slide 10, interest expense was $36 million, down 10.6%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year\u2019s refinancing, a lower LIBOR rate and lower revolving credit facility borrowings. Other income reflects $36 million from the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investment. Proceeds from the sale were excluded from non-GAAP metrics. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26.2%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $97 million compared to $56 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.4% and up 50 basis points versus last year\u2019s rate, primarily due to higher foreign taxes. As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $142 million GAAP net income per share, was $1.93, up 47.4%. Our non-GAAP net income was $286 million in the quarter, up 27%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% from last year. Turning to first half results on Slides 14 through 19, net sales were $10 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 14.9% on an average daily sales basis as we had one fewer selling day in the first half of 2021. The one fewer selling day will be made up in Q4 when we have one extra selling day compared to the prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, first half consolidated net sales were 13.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.7 billion up 11.6% and gross profit margin was 16.8% down approximately 40 basis points. Operating income was $693 million and non-GAAP operating income was $786 million, up 22.4%. Net income was $507 million, and non-GAAP net income was $536 million, up 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $3.76, up 27.9%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20, at June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion and net debt was $3.4 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $110 million, as shown on Slide 21. This was lighter than a typical first half but expected given last year\u2019s record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and one-time items. Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. Additionally, working capital increases during periods of rapid growth and we made strategic investments in inventory to support customers during this choppy supply environment. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $433 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $377 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $170 per share. Moving to Slide 22, the 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 4 days from last year\u2019s second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by improved accounts receivable collection performance. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 23, our priorities remain the same: first, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the second quarter at 2.1x, up 0.4 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Focal Point and Amplified IT are great examples. And fourth, we turn excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5x to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We now expect to return over $1.7 billion to shareholders in 2021, including at least $1.5 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. This $0.5 billion increase from last quarter\u2019s comments reflects our confidence in the cash flow generation and earnings power of the business. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets, and we will continue to deploy capital for M&A that passes our screens. Of course, as we always do, we will closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 24, the current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers and in CDW Canada. On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Notebooks, displays, docking stations, certain infrastructure hardware, including networking and servers are constrained, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call, and most vendor partners do not expect the situation to improve in the second half. With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency including the contribution from Focal Point. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 80 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the strong mid-teens, call it, 16% to 16.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. The updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.35 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter, the 2015 to 2019 5-year average sequential increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis was approximately 4%, and we expect this year\u2019s third quarter to be in line with normal seasonality, which equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow low double digits. Our updated outlook for the balance of the year assumes modest growth in the backlog. If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the second half and into 2022. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over-delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow, including capital expenditures and the cash conversion cycle, can also be found on Slide 25. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I\u2019ll ask Tamia to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatt Cabral: Yes. Thank you very much. It sounds like a strong quarter on the client device side again. There is some concern out in the marketplace around just the sustainability of PC and Chromebook demand. Curious what you\u2019re hearing from your customers around sustainability of demand. And I guess I also heard the commentary about the backlog continuing to grow. Just curious how much of that increase was within PC specifically. And when do you think you\u2019ll actually be able to catch up to that backlog?\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Matt. It\u2019s Chris. Look, on demand, I would tell you what we\u2019re seeing from customers is continued resiliency and need for devices, whether it is more devices in the hands of people who are working remotely or at least partially remotely kids in school, new use cases the ability to utilize the stimulus dollars now to buy those devices. And then you add on refresh that\u2019s coming up a pretty large installed base that\u2019s looking towards refresh. I would just tell you that the demand feels resilient. Vis-\u00e0-vis CDW, we certainly have some tough overlaps, some compares we\u2019re looking at in K12 given the enormous growth last year. But generally speaking, demand remains solid. On the supply side, Chromebooks have really started to ease up a little bit. That\u2019s \u2013 the OEMs had to plan for that last fall and they did, but we are still seeing supply constraints with regard to notebooks.\nCollin Kebo: Yes, Matt, I would just add in terms of the composition of the growth in the backlog. As Chris said, notebook certainly contributed to that with Chromebooks getting better, but we did see backlog growth in some of the other areas in the transactional part of the business, things like displays and panels and monitors, things like that. And then we also saw the backlog increase across some infrastructure products.\nMatt Cabral: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then for my follow-up, on operating margin, you guys just did 8.1%. And if I look at the first half, you\u2019re slightly below 8%. I guess the full year guidance, if I heard it correctly, is still for mid-7s. So I guess just wondering what the offsets are in the second half of the year. And maybe just help us bridge from that first half to the second half.\nChris Leahy: Yes. On the full year guide, mid-7s, obviously, there is a range there. I\u2019d expect us probably to be at the stronger end of that mid-7s. But as you think about the back half of the year, as we talked about in our prepared comments, we believe now is the time to invest in the business, and we will continue to aggressively invest in the business. You saw that we added nearly 500 coworkers in the second quarter. As those coworkers come into the P&L, obviously, all of that\u2019s not reflected as we go forward. So we will be carrying two full quarters of expense for that and continuing to make additional investments in the business.\nMatt Cabral: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nLexi Curnin: Hi. This is Lexi Curnin on for Amit. So, yes, thank you for taking the question. And I guess, Collin, you just mentioned investing back into the business. And it would be great if you could talk about some of those initiatives that you\u2019re set to undertake there.\nCollin Kebo: Yes, I\u2019m happy to take that. It\u2019s really a variety of initiatives, both organically and inorganically. On the organic side, we continue to invest behind the areas solutions areas that are particularly high value to our customers, so customer-facing coworkers and technical areas, both on the presales and the service delivery side. I think you began to see some of the fruits of those investments in the second quarter as we referenced the success that we were having in the professional services part of the business. We are also making investments in our own digital transformation into our own infrastructure to drive productivity with our sales force and how we interact with customers and just how we scale and operate the business more efficiently.\nLexi Curnin: Great. Thank you so much.\nCollin Kebo: Thanks, Lexi.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess first, talk about what the drivers are behind the assumption of greater share gains this year, which is reflected in the 425 to 500 basis point growth premium.\nChris Leahy: Well, good morning, Katy. Good to hear from you. In terms of our increase, look, if you look at where we\u2019ve had meaningful growth, client devices, video, other hardware categories and what customers\u2019 priorities are going forward, where they are allocating more technology spend to infrastructure needs, we don\u2019t think the market is growing at the same rate that we are growing. So we\u2019re flowing some of that increase through to our premium. And as you know, the CDW tends to outpace the U.S. IT market by more than 200 to 300 basis points in periods of hardware fresh. So we tend to overindex because we have more recognized at the net line. The one thing I would say is supply remains a wildcard. Collin\u2019s talked about it. I\u2019ve talked about it. We\u2019re not underestimating supply. The teams have done a phenomenal job, frankly, in managing it and getting our fair, fair share. But we think that given the mix of what we\u2019re seeing our customers buy and how that hits the top line, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving this \u2013 the view on that.\nKaty Huberty: But also just to follow-up on that, Chris, it does seem like the supply environment is working to your favor. It\u2019s hitting everyone but it seems like it\u2019s hitting your business less than others, and that\u2019s also driving some of the share gains. Is that fair?\nChris Leahy: Well, yes, that is fair, Katy to some extent. Look, our distribution center, our logistics capabilities, all the things that we talk about put us in a position where we \u2013 customers are betting on us. They are turning to us as their best bet to get supply, and partners understand that. So I\u2019d like to say we get our fair, fair share. You can say we get our unfair share, but we do tend to benefit in supply-constrained environment. That said, I just \u2013 I\u2019ll repeat what we\u2019ve been saying for the past couple of quarters. It\u2019s so prevalent at this point and the visibility is very difficult that it\u2019s hard to really have a good view over the next couple of quarters other than just saying we think it\u2019s going to get a little worse before it gets better. It\u2019s going to continue into next year. But I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019ve been working very closely with our OEMs, and they have just been terrific. And we\u2019re also working closely with customers to find choices for them if they are willing to move their requirements and their standards, which small businesses or others aren\u2019t. But yes, we generally \u2013 because we can create a solution and deliver to customers, we generally get our greater than fair share, if you will.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you for that. I guess maybe a follow-up for Collin. As you turned into the September quarter and the month of July, was \u2013 did you see any change in the pace of order growth or the degree of supply constraints in the first few weeks of the current quarter?\nCollin Kebo: Yes, Katy, we\u2019re really not providing more detail on Q3 intra-quarter beyond what we shared in the comments, which was we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with commercial customers and in CDW Canada. And on the supply side, we are expecting modest growth in the backlog as we move throughout the year.\nKaty Huberty: Great. Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Thanks, Katy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And congratulations on great results and the increased outlook. There is a bit of a debate out there about double bookings and over-ordering from basically every end market. So I was hoping you could kind of give some commentary because I would kind of assume, and maybe I\u2019m wrong, that small and midsized businesses and Education really can\u2019t and don\u2019t double order because they just don\u2019t have quite a large needs as maybe, say, the Fortune 100 companies where they know they are going to always need so much. Maybe I\u2019m wrong on that, but any thoughts about double ordering from your end markets? And then that leads to the follow-up question part about \u2013 the concern about a potential pocket of error or a slowdown post when the supply chain gets back to equilibrium. Any commentaries on those would be great. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes, sure. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with the first one in terms of double ordering. Of course, that\u2019s something that we would \u2013 we always worry about and look at carefully in this type of environment. What I\u2019d tell you is the information that we are working with our OEMs to get and provide some level of visibility to our customers is resonating really well. And therefore, they have a level of content, when CDW says it\u2019s going to be 8 weeks or 12 weeks, and we can get it, that we actually have it or can get it. We have seen minimal. It\u2019s really any double ordering with our customers. So we feel very confident in the new orders have come in, in our backlog and in the way that we\u2019re operating with the customers. In terms of an air pocket, Collin, do you want to chat a little bit about backlog supply and air pockets?\nCollin Kebo: Yes. Sure, Chris. Maybe I\u2019ll just add a little bit on to the double ordering comment as well, Jim. I think also, when you think about what the majority of our customers are ordering, they are not widgets. It\u2019s customized to the specs of a large corporate customer or the needs of the school district. And the thought that you\u2019re going to place an order like that with multiple vendors, I think, is low. At very small and \u2013 a small office, home office customer that needs 20 notebooks, it\u2019s impossible that there is some double ordering going on there. Yes. But I think overall, when you look at the backlog, we feel pretty good that those are firm orders sitting in the backlog. The comment I\u2019ll make actually gets into your next one. What we have seen, though, is what I would call an order pull-forward-where customers are placing orders sooner than they might normally because of the supply environment or to try to get ahead of expected price increases from our OEM vendor partners. So sitting in that backlog is a little bit of a pull-forward. And I think that\u2019s getting to your question around the air pocket. I guess the way I think about it is there is a little bit of a hedge here. To the extent that there may then be a little bit of a lull in the ordering. If, at some point in the future, orders return to a normal timing and flow pattern, we would also then have the flush of the backlog at some point in time. So I think maybe that\u2019s one way to think about it.\nJim Suva: Great. Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. Appreciate it.\nCollin Kebo: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about some of the stimulus programs that are out there and being discussed and how you think it may benefit, I realize timing is a question. But thinking about the infrastructure plan that\u2019s being discussed, also E-Rate, I think there were some changes to that. And then are you hearing any of the education customers talking about using some of the prior stimulus, because I think there is still an awful lot of that money floating around. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes, Shannon. Well, yes, to all your questions, let me start with education. There is the Emerging Connectivity Act which is about $7.1 billion, and we have worked closely with educational systems to tap that. So, that\u2019s been something that the education customers are very focused on and taking advantage of with our help facilitating and navigating. So, absolutely there. And we also say State & Local, we have talked about the three rounds of stimulus funding, last March, last December, this March and how that impact is stable, in particular, because in December\u2019s Appropriations Act, there was no additional funding for State & Local. So, State & Local tended to pause kind of step back and say, what\u2019s going to happen in the next round. Well, in the next round, which is this March, there were dollars allocated to State & Local. So, we have now seen the use of those funds pick up. I would tell you that the first couple of months in this quarter was a lot of assessing, understanding, again, working with our customers to help them understand how to tap the funds and where we get the money, how to get the money, etcetera. But we did see a nice pickup in the last part of second quarter in terms of using the stimulus dollars. So, that\u2019s another area where we are seeing strength in stimulus. In terms of the packages coming forward, the new ones coming out yet to be seen, we will review those. And to the extent that there is opportunity to help our customers, certainly, we will take advantage of those. Clearly, the focus of the administration on things like technology, infrastructure or technology as infrastructure and cyber security are high on the list of priorities for our customers, and we have capabilities that can help them to both implement solutions around those, but more importantly, navigate the stimulus funds. So, we will \u2013 I think we will be very effective in doing that.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up, in terms of cash flow, is there anything we should think about \u2013 just the demand is so strong in so many areas you have backlog. And that \u2013 I mean, how should we think about cash flow dynamics from a working capital perspective in coming quarters, because I would assume it\u2019s somewhat of a fluid situation. Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. Shannon, from a cash flow perspective, obviously, as the business experiences rapid growth, we do make an investment in working capital, and you saw some of that in the quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have intentionally been carrying higher inventory levels, specifically customer-specific inventory to help them work through rollouts of their projects. So, I think as long as we are in this choppy supply environment, I would expect inventory to be running higher than typical levels. As it relates to our total free cash flow, we were down in the first half of the year relative to a normal first half of the year. I would attribute that, though, mostly to the strong timing and things we benefit from in the prior year and not indicative of any type of change in the future free cash flow generation capability of the business.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, can you give us your thoughts on the Federal business, I mean, you are facing tough comps from the U.S. Census project. But just wondering when that business can turnaround and grow year-on-year. Are there projects that you are seeing where some government agencies probably have PCs that are coming up that are \u2013 10 PCs even that are coming up for replacement. So, just your thoughts on the opportunity set that you have in Federal and when that business can turn around from a year-on-year growth standpoint?\nChris Leahy: Sure. Good morning, Ruplu. What I would say about the Fed business is we had a number of large opportunities that are going to be rolling out in the second half of the year and others that we are pursuing. Overlapping expenses projects, we knew we had that and we had another \u2013 a number of other very large client device projects last year. So, what we have been putting in the back half of the year is not going to be enough likely to overcome that. But look, the beauty of our model is the diversity of our customer end markets. So, we said having such strength last year in the sense of \u2013 and kind of coming back to the year, if you will, with I would say, next year, 2022, picking up from a growth perspective, we have got all of our other customer end markets that are going to be constrained. The other thing I would just say is a reminder of the Federal space. The Census deal and some other deals that we are doing there are, frankly, that we are working on that are fairly similar, really reflects the positioning that we have with our customers in that customer end market, which is a real thought leader, a real solutions provider and a services first player. So kudos to the team for continuing to grow our reputation and capabilities and we can see it paying off in the opportunities that we have got in the pipeline.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Got it. Thanks for the details on that, Chris. And just for my follow-up, Collin, can I ask, of the 50 basis points improvement sequentially that you saw in operating margin, is there a way to quantify how much of that was mix versus higher volumes or FX? And is there anything in that that is not sustainable going forward? Thanks.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. Ruplu, if you think about it, the gross margin improved sequentially. We went from a 16.4% to 17.2%. So, that was 80 basis points. Now we have a variable cost structure, so, not all of that passes to the operating margin. I would say that there are some elements of seasonality in that. When you think about \u2013 there is a software vendor, a big partner of ours who has a fiscal year end in June. And as we mentioned in our comments, we had very strong software results and very strong cloud and Software as a Service results. So, we did benefit seasonally from mixing into some netted down items there that I wouldn\u2019t expect to recur at necessarily the same pace in the second half of the year. And then also our partner funding improved a bit sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Our partners reimburse some of our advertising. And as we increased our advertising investment sequentially, you saw part of that sitting in the gross margin. So, I think most of the increase then is primarily explained by the gross margin. And then in terms of how you think about the back half of the year, I just \u2013 the comment I made to Matt earlier in the call around we are continuing to invest in the business, and that co-worker count gets layered in and you will have full quarter\u2019s worth of that expense coming up in subsequent quarters.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. I appreciate it.\nCollin Kebo: Thanks Ruplu.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. I wanted to ask, again, regarding the strength that you are seeing on the corporate side, reacceleration there. And you did talk about on-prem infrastructure spending. Is that just based on pent-up demand? Are you seeing companies reinvest as they are getting back to the office? And in terms of the areas you talked about, networking, you have talked about servers, could you just give more color on what you are seeing there?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a little bit of everything you mentioned there. We certainly are seeing this driven by folks getting back to the office. We are seeing it pent-up demand. I think one of \u2013 our leader in the solutions area for our partner relationships kind of refer to 2020 as a range away in terms of as we think about refresh. And that\u2019s not a bad way to think about it. Last year was a pause on a lot of things. So, now we are seeing servers growing double digits. Certainly, what our customers are focusing on is things like workload optimization and application performance. And so that\u2019s where they are focusing to invest in infrastructure. And ultimately, frankly, this is tied to supporting digital transformation, which is at the forefront of every customer\u2019s mind. So I think if we look forward, hybrid work is driving assessment on what customers are going to need, so supporting the office. As we get new next-gen releases in computer technologies, given the analytic heavy nature of the future and the analytics that customers are needing to really win and keep in the marketplace, I think we are going to continue to see some upgrades in the needs there. And then in the other areas like storage, what we are seeing now is a real enhanced focus on data center observability. So, customers are looking at costs and optimizing operations. And so there is a growing and leading system, modest churn and automation. And so our Digital Velocity and ServiceNow businesses are really on fire. And we are just continuing to scrutinize the spend. Now that said, where our customers are ending up, I think, and is proved out by how customers are in-house in the future is a multi-cloud world, which includes on-prem, on-subject cloud-like capabilities, which is growing in terms of \u2013 assets as well as multiple clouds that they are using. Last year, I think we talked about, and earlier this year, about customers really taking a step back and reassess how to optimize their infrastructure, and that\u2019s what we are seeing. The good news is whether they are refreshing and updating, whether they are moving to a meter consumption model on time, whether they are going to colo or whether they are moving workloads to various clouds, public clouds, we are helping them at the front end to play in that, then to implement the plan. So, it keeps us right front and center of helping them to deploy their infrastructure strategy.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Thanks very much for that. And my second question regarding the education market. Obviously, it\u2019s been a huge growth area for you now running roughly 20% of revenue versus low to mid-teens 18, 19. So \u2013 and you talked about some of the continued strong drivers, including funding. At some point, though, I would expect a lot of that spending to wind down. So, what should we expect in terms of the base case for that market? It should be higher because you have got a lot more school districts using devices, maintenance, etcetera. But how should we think about that business long-term for you?\nChris Leahy: Yes, it\u2019s a great question, and we continue to see it as a growth opportunity. If we just think about the various cycles we have been through in K-12, you can go back 10 years, where Chromebooks were introduced and we created this with good service, and then we help to see modernization of the classroom. And every cycle that education has been through, CDW has been at the forefront of helping educators, administrators, technology to figure out the best way to teach kids, to educate in the classroom and now outside the classroom in different ways, in the learning \u2013 in the typical facility, at home, in the classroom. So, we continue to see it as a growth opportunity because of the natural evolution of education in this country and in our other markets. I think, certainly, given how strong last year was, in particular, Q4, I don\u2019t think we are going to see the kind of equity and access, the classroom experience opportunities that we are selling into. We are not going to see ourselves overlap or overcome how well we did last quarter. But over the long-term, Matt, I would say it\u2019s a great market. We have fantastic expertise, especially when you think about Amplified IT, the acquisition we did last quarter. And we are seeing traction in the market incredibly strong. So, we are very bullish on K-12.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys. Just a quick question here on the latest acquisition of Focal Point Data, can you give us a little bit of color in terms of like the margin profile? And I guess what I am trying to look at here is how quick or what\u2019s going to be the impact on the overall operating margins of CDW over the next year or 2 years. I mean I am assuming we would expect that to go higher because of these acquisitions. But hopefully, you could provide some color and some idea of the context.\nCollin Kebo: Hi. Good morning, Keith. We typically would not provide that level of granularity with our acquisitions. I guess it\u2019s \u2013 while strategically important and of high value to our customers and sellers, it is a services business. So, in terms of just absolute magnitude of contribution to CDW, I would say the impact will be relatively small. And as we stated in the press release on Monday, I expect it not to have a material impact to earnings for the full year. I guess what I would say, though, is, I mean, if you look at the investments we have been making over the past couple of quarters, we have been picking up the services businesses that are of high value to our customers. And I think collectively, they are contributing to some of the gross margin strength, and you saw that in the second quarter, and we commented on it. So, I wouldn\u2019t call out anything specifically, but would just say, in aggregate, the investments we are making behind the services businesses in the high-growth areas that our value to our customers are helping the margin.\nKeith Housum: Great. I appreciate it. And then looking at the overall environment now, obviously, raw materials are a significant cost for the complete increases that we are seeing in technology. Is there a way to kind of like provide an average of what you are seeing in terms of price increases within your biggest sellers? I mean are we seeing 4% to 5% increases right now? And is that going to contribute to growth here not only in the second half of the year, but into next year as well?\nCollin Kebo: In terms of contribution to our sales growth, Keith?\nKeith Housum: Yes.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. That\u2019s a difficult question to answer at a portfolio level, because much of what we sell doesn\u2019t have a hardware unit associated with it, right, when you think about software, services, cloud and then you see things like value shifting to the software for integrated solutions. But maybe one way to think about it is if I pick a big category like client devices, which were up high teens in the quarter, we saw balanced growth in terms of both units and ASPs, average selling price, and that was true for most customer end markets. So, it\u2019s a combination of both unit growth and pricing.\nKeith Housum: It\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess in your prepared remarks and through the call, you have talked about investments and this being the right time to invest back in the business. Just wondering how should we think about that and interpret that from a model perspective. Like are we entering a period of time when your OpEx increases will be more in line with revenue growth or does the longer term model still remain kind of for OpEx to be below \u2013 OpEx increases to be below revenue growth? And just trying to figure out where we are in terms of time period of investment? And I have a follow-up as well. Thank you.\nCollin Kebo: Yes. Samik, thanks for joining the call and welcome. We haven\u2019t provided multiyear thoughts \u2013 just a view for the year. And you can see for the full year, we continue to believe we will deliver a mid-7 operating margin. So, you can then think about those investments being funded within the context of that, those thoughts around the operating margin.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Just a quick follow-up, I think from \u2013 you mentioned for 3Q, you are expecting it to be very in line with seasonality that you have seen historically. If I walk through the numbers and try to get an implied 4Q here, it does look like your \u2013 and if I am doing the math right, it looks like you are guiding something very in line again with seasonality. Just thinking with all the backlog that you have and the demand backdrop that we are in, where things are pretty strong, is that the right way to look at it given that expecting a seasonal moderation in December or should we be expecting something better?\nCollin Kebo: Yes. I think you can do the math, given the thoughts on the guide for the third quarter and then what\u2019s left over for the fourth quarter. I would just be careful about your thoughts on the backlog. As we said, we don\u2019t assume an improvement in the backlog at our full year modeling thoughts. So, that\u2019s not captured. And if the backlog were to get worked down, that would be upside to the outlook. And I think when you run the math, on what the implied Q4 growth rate is year-over-year, that\u2019s again just a reflection of some of the big overlaps that we have been talking about, specifically within education in the fourth quarter. Last year, we had the large Mississippi Department of Education deal, and obviously, a big contribution from the census that the devices came back.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nCollin Kebo: Okay. Thank you, Samik.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Chris Leahy for closing remarks.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Tania. And let me close by saying I would like to acknowledge first, the incredible dedication of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, partners and all of our CDW stakeholders, particularly this quarter, our first quarter delivering over $5 billion in sales, an extraordinary quarter, supporting our customers. Thank you all. Thank you also to our customers for the great privilege and opportunity to serve you. And to our investors and analysts participating in the call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Brittany. I will begin this morning with an overview of second quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at the financials and capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks as always to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. We had a record second quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the second quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, a quarterly record in our first quarter over $5 billion of net sales. Net sales grew 17.9% above last year on a reported and average daily sales basis and up 16.3% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 18.2% to $883 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $418 million, an increase of 23.6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% on a reported basis and up 27.9% in constant currency. Our outstanding results reflect our team's extraordinary execution and the importance of our scale, industry experience and knowledge and strong customer relationships. The diversity of our customer end markets and breadth of our solutions portfolio continues to serve us well. Our record second quarter performance reflected a rebound in commercial customer spending, driving excellent results in our corporate small business and Canada segments and continued strength in our education channel. Our results reflect strong momentum across our business as technology spending recovers from lower spending last year and also increased demand as customers seek to modernize, optimize and innovate. In 2020, customers prioritize remote enablement and continuity. So far in 2021, customers have prioritized digital transformation, security and hybrid and cloud solutions as well as continued investments in endpoint solutions, driving strong growth for solutions and transactions. Customers are investing to enable the future and adding resilience into their operations, strengthening and securing infrastructure, platforms and endpoints, leveraging the cloud, preparing for return to in-person operations and industrializing remote enablement for permanently changed work models. We have combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and new logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers, extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate the supply environment. Our scale and strong financial position enabled us to continue helping customers navigate the choppy supply environment. As we previewed on our last earnings call, supply challenges increased during the second quarter for many transactional products and some infrastructure products. While riding strengthened as economies rebounded and more customers turn to CDW for expertise across the full technology solution stack and lifecycle, our backlog increased compared to the first quarter. Another impact in the tight supply environment was increasing prices, which our teams were generally able to pass on. We expect supply constraints to continue through the second half of the year and into next year. Now, let's take a deeper look at the second quarter customer end market performance. Corporate increased 27% as customer spend sharply recovered with strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers remain focused on digital transformation, hybrid and cloud and security. Customers also began to prepare for employees to return to the office in the coming months, driving endpoint solutions, including notebooks, video and accessory growth. Our corporate backlog increased during the quarter as customers await availability due to standards requirements and generally larger orders. Small Business delivered exceptional growth, growing 60%, yes, 6-0 percent as optimism improved and hiring increased. Our team helps customers with remote enablement, security and video, leading to strong growth in both transactional and solution spend. As we have shared previously, Small Business customers tend to be nimbler in their technology requirements. So, performance was less impacted by supply constraints. Net sales for our government channel decreased 29%. Federal declined double-digits due to overlapping our device-as-a-service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau and other client device programs that were strong last year. State & Local decreased mid single-digits. Customers evaluated their needs at the beginning of the quarter and started to make investments utilizing stimulus funding towards the end of the quarter, making timing versus demand more of a driver of performance. Our education channel grew 27%. The team delivered another $1 billion plus quarter with strong double-digit growth from both K-12 and higher ed. K-12 and higher ed customers are focused on investments to support equity and access and to enhance the in-classroom experience as schools prepare for students to return this fall, which drove both strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers continue to turn to us for our holistic capabilities across technology solutions and our deep education experience. Healthcare increased 7%, returning to year-over-year growth. Customers resumed projects that have been sidelined during the pandemic as budgets reopened driven by patients returning for elective procedures and providers made investments for the future. Growth was balanced between transactional and solutions categories. Other, which represents our UK and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, UK net sales decreased low single-digits overlapping strong public sector performance and reflecting a slower commercial recovery. The Canada team drove strong double-digit growth in local currency, powered by commercial customer strength and strong transactional and solutions performance. Our second quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. Transactions increased strong double-digits driven by client device growth of 17% as well as strong growth in video and accessories. Solutions also increased strong double-digits driven by software, collaboration tools and data center solutions. This led to balanced double-digit growth across hardware, software and services. Our services growth reflects strong organic performance and inorganic contributions. As I have shared before, services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double-digits across all customer segments driven by robust growth in security, infrastructure-as-a-service and productivity. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue and we are well-positioned to deliver. I want to take a moment to highlight our security process given its importance to our customers as cyber threats are constantly emerging and evolving and increasing. Security customer spend grew strong double-digits as customers improved their security frameworks to respond to increasing threats. Our teams help customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation. Our second quarter operating and financial performance reflected the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape, and our ongoing success executing our three-part strategy for growth. They are all important drivers of our past and future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extent of products, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the sector of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. Technology has become more essential to our customers and we are best positioned to help them navigate the complexity. And the final driver of our performance, our three-part strategy for growth, which is to: first, acquire new customers and actual share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share a few examples of our strategy in action. Earlier this week, we announced that we acquired Focal Point. Focal Point is a leading provider of cybersecurity services with deep capabilities in identity and access management as well as the ability to serve customers across the full cybersecurity landscape. Focal Point is a leader in the cybersecurity space with an expert team and complementary customer relationships. As I have shared earlier, security is a top focus area for our customers. The addition of Focal Point expands and accelerates our security practice, adding over 200 coworkers who we welcome to CDW. We see many significant opportunities ahead and this is a great example of adding capability to help customers across the full technology solution stack and full technology lifecycle. We view M&A as an important part of our capital allocation strategy to expand CDW's strategic capabilities. Our success is a testament to our coworkers, including those who joined CDW through acquisition, who have delivered consistent with the strategic rationale of each deal, delivering tremendous value to our customers. Let me share another example. Over the last year, education customers have embraced technology more than ever and fundamentally changed how they purchased with districts and school systems banding together to access stimulus programs and procure technology to enable remote hybrid and in-person model. A long-time higher ed customer who was transitioning from a decentralized technology program to centralized turned to us to provide a better end-user experience for its students and staff across its 20 plus campuses. Our team leveraged our digital capabilities to integrate directly into their systems. This greatly improved the ease of purchasing, providing configured branded bundles, hitting pre-negotiated pricing, direct-to-home logistics and product availability in a constrained environment. Our customer-first focus and logistical capabilities continue to be differentiators that drive value with our customers and vendor partners. This is a great example of how we leverage our competitive advantages win. Last, I want to share a story about a corporate customer that our team helps execute a global compute refresh, changing from a BYOD organization to corporate standards. The Director of Global IT service delivery leading the project has turned exclusively to us to partner on this important initiative for over 8,000 employees in 20 countries. Having a global partner was very important. Our teams in the US, UK and Canada worked closely together to deliver for the customer. We worked with our vendor partners to ensure we had product when the customer needed it, which is crucial in the current environment and the capability we have, given our partner relationships, strong financial position and distribution centers. What started as a device refresh has led to partnering on the customers' return to office initiative and technology enhancements as well as software and security projects, throwing the account from less than $1 million in net sales last year to over $7 million this year. Our team understood the customers' challenges and leveraged CDW's capabilities on a worldwide basis to provide outstanding service, leading to more opportunities. These examples highlight CDW's three-part strategy for growth and demonstrate the value of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I am so proud of the way our teams continued to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. During the quarter, our teams continued to safely reengage with customers and partners in-person. Although the environment is dynamic, groups of coworkers have started to return to our offices for key meetings and small events and others are starting to work more regularly in our offices. Our ReunITe team is working hard to thoughtfully re-imagine and orchestrate the future of work, so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can, while we continue to fortify our strong culture. Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are again increasing our outlook for both U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market to grow about 5% and our top line to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. For the third quarter, we expect customer demand trends to continue and have confidence in how our teams are executing and in our solutions and services portfolio. That said we remain cautious about the supply environment, which we expect to continue to be challenged. While there are other wildcards such as COVID variant, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects for the business has never been higher. Technology is more essential to all sectors of the economy and will continue to play an increasingly important role in years ahead. We have great confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and outexecute our competition. Finally, let me take a moment to update you on our CFO transition. The process is progressing very well. I am really pleased with the caliber of candidates interested and excited about CDW. We will provide further updates once the process is complete. Until then, Collin is fully engaged and after his successor's name, we will remain on board to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I will turn it over to Collin. Good morning, Matt. It's Chris. Look, on demand, I would tell you what we're seeing from customers is continued resiliency and need for devices, whether it is more devices in the hands of people who are working remotely or at least partially remotely kids in school, new use cases the ability to utilize the stimulus dollars now to buy those devices. And then you add on refresh that's coming up a pretty large installed base that's looking towards refresh. I would just tell you that the demand feels resilient. Vis-a\u0300-vis CDW, we certainly have some tough overlaps, some compares we're looking at in K12 given the enormous growth last year. But generally speaking, demand remains solid. On the supply side, Chromebooks have really started to ease up a little bit. That's \u2013 the OEMs had to plan for that last fall and they did, but we are still seeing supply constraints with regard to notebooks. Yes. On the full year guide, mid-7s, obviously, there is a range there. I'd expect us probably to be at the stronger end of that mid-7s. But as you think about the back half of the year, as we talked about in our prepared comments, we believe now is the time to invest in the business, and we will continue to aggressively invest in the business. You saw that we added nearly 500 coworkers in the second quarter. As those coworkers come into the P&L, obviously, all of that's not reflected as we go forward. So we will be carrying two full quarters of expense for that and continuing to make additional investments in the business. Well, good morning, Katy. Good to hear from you. In terms of our increase, look, if you look at where we've had meaningful growth, client devices, video, other hardware categories and what customers' priorities are going forward, where they are allocating more technology spend to infrastructure needs, we don't think the market is growing at the same rate that we are growing. So we're flowing some of that increase through to our premium. And as you know, the CDW tends to outpace the U.S. IT market by more than 200 to 300 basis points in periods of hardware fresh. So we tend to overindex because we have more recognized at the net line. The one thing I would say is supply remains a wildcard. Collin's talked about it. I've talked about it. We're not underestimating supply. The teams have done a phenomenal job, frankly, in managing it and getting our fair, fair share. But we think that given the mix of what we're seeing our customers buy and how that hits the top line, that's what's driving this \u2013 the view on that. Well, yes, that is fair, Katy to some extent. Look, our distribution center, our logistics capabilities, all the things that we talk about put us in a position where we \u2013 customers are betting on us. They are turning to us as their best bet to get supply, and partners understand that. So I'd like to say we get our fair, fair share. You can say we get our unfair share, but we do tend to benefit in supply-constrained environment. That said, I just \u2013 I'll repeat what we've been saying for the past couple of quarters. It's so prevalent at this point and the visibility is very difficult that it's hard to really have a good view over the next couple of quarters other than just saying we think it's going to get a little worse before it gets better. It's going to continue into next year. But I'll tell you, we've been working very closely with our OEMs, and they have just been terrific. And we're also working closely with customers to find choices for them if they are willing to move their requirements and their standards, which small businesses or others aren't. But yes, we generally \u2013 because we can create a solution and deliver to customers, we generally get our greater than fair share, if you will. Yes, sure. Good morning. I'll start with the first one in terms of double ordering. Of course, that's something that we would \u2013 we always worry about and look at carefully in this type of environment. What I'd tell you is the information that we are working with our OEMs to get and provide some level of visibility to our customers is resonating really well. And therefore, they have a level of content, when CDW says it's going to be 8 weeks or 12 weeks, and we can get it, that we actually have it or can get it. We have seen minimal. It's really any double ordering with our customers. So we feel very confident in the new orders have come in, in our backlog and in the way that we're operating with the customers. In terms of an air pocket, Collin, do you want to chat a little bit about backlog supply and air pockets? Yes, Shannon. Well, yes, to all your questions, let me start with education. There is the Emerging Connectivity Act which is about $7.1 billion, and we have worked closely with educational systems to tap that. So, that's been something that the education customers are very focused on and taking advantage of with our help facilitating and navigating. So, absolutely there. And we also say State & Local, we have talked about the three rounds of stimulus funding, last March, last December, this March and how that impact is stable, in particular, because in December's Appropriations Act, there was no additional funding for State & Local. So, State & Local tended to pause kind of step back and say, what's going to happen in the next round. Well, in the next round, which is this March, there were dollars allocated to State & Local. So, we have now seen the use of those funds pick up. I would tell you that the first couple of months in this quarter was a lot of assessing, understanding, again, working with our customers to help them understand how to tap the funds and where we get the money, how to get the money, etcetera. But we did see a nice pickup in the last part of second quarter in terms of using the stimulus dollars. So, that's another area where we are seeing strength in stimulus. In terms of the packages coming forward, the new ones coming out yet to be seen, we will review those. And to the extent that there is opportunity to help our customers, certainly, we will take advantage of those. Clearly, the focus of the administration on things like technology, infrastructure or technology as infrastructure and cyber security are high on the list of priorities for our customers, and we have capabilities that can help them to both implement solutions around those, but more importantly, navigate the stimulus funds. So, we will \u2013 I think we will be very effective in doing that. Sure. Good morning, Ruplu. What I would say about the Fed business is we had a number of large opportunities that are going to be rolling out in the second half of the year and others that we are pursuing. Overlapping expenses projects, we knew we had that and we had another \u2013 a number of other very large client device projects last year. So, what we have been putting in the back half of the year is not going to be enough likely to overcome that. But look, the beauty of our model is the diversity of our customer end markets. So, we said having such strength last year in the sense of \u2013 and kind of coming back to the year, if you will, with I would say, next year, 2022, picking up from a growth perspective, we have got all of our other customer end markets that are going to be constrained. The other thing I would just say is a reminder of the Federal space. The Census deal and some other deals that we are doing there are, frankly, that we are working on that are fairly similar, really reflects the positioning that we have with our customers in that customer end market, which is a real thought leader, a real solutions provider and a services first player. So kudos to the team for continuing to grow our reputation and capabilities and we can see it paying off in the opportunities that we have got in the pipeline. Yes. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. It's a little bit of everything you mentioned there. We certainly are seeing this driven by folks getting back to the office. We are seeing it pent-up demand. I think one of \u2013 our leader in the solutions area for our partner relationships kind of refer to 2020 as a range away in terms of as we think about refresh. And that's not a bad way to think about it. Last year was a pause on a lot of things. So, now we are seeing servers growing double digits. Certainly, what our customers are focusing on is things like workload optimization and application performance. And so that's where they are focusing to invest in infrastructure. And ultimately, frankly, this is tied to supporting digital transformation, which is at the forefront of every customer's mind. So I think if we look forward, hybrid work is driving assessment on what customers are going to need, so supporting the office. As we get new next-gen releases in computer technologies, given the analytic heavy nature of the future and the analytics that customers are needing to really win and keep in the marketplace, I think we are going to continue to see some upgrades in the needs there. And then in the other areas like storage, what we are seeing now is a real enhanced focus on data center observability. So, customers are looking at costs and optimizing operations. And so there is a growing and leading system, modest churn and automation. And so our Digital Velocity and ServiceNow businesses are really on fire. And we are just continuing to scrutinize the spend. Now that said, where our customers are ending up, I think, and is proved out by how customers are in-house in the future is a multi-cloud world, which includes on-prem, on-subject cloud-like capabilities, which is growing in terms of \u2013 assets as well as multiple clouds that they are using. Last year, I think we talked about, and earlier this year, about customers really taking a step back and reassess how to optimize their infrastructure, and that's what we are seeing. The good news is whether they are refreshing and updating, whether they are moving to a meter consumption model on time, whether they are going to colo or whether they are moving workloads to various clouds, public clouds, we are helping them at the front end to play in that, then to implement the plan. So, it keeps us right front and center of helping them to deploy their infrastructure strategy. Yes, it's a great question, and we continue to see it as a growth opportunity. If we just think about the various cycles we have been through in K-12, you can go back 10 years, where Chromebooks were introduced and we created this with good service, and then we help to see modernization of the classroom. And every cycle that education has been through, CDW has been at the forefront of helping educators, administrators, technology to figure out the best way to teach kids, to educate in the classroom and now outside the classroom in different ways, in the learning \u2013 in the typical facility, at home, in the classroom. So, we continue to see it as a growth opportunity because of the natural evolution of education in this country and in our other markets. I think, certainly, given how strong last year was, in particular, Q4, I don't think we are going to see the kind of equity and access, the classroom experience opportunities that we are selling into. We are not going to see ourselves overlap or overcome how well we did last quarter. But over the long-term, Matt, I would say it's a great market. We have fantastic expertise, especially when you think about Amplified IT, the acquisition we did last quarter. And we are seeing traction in the market incredibly strong. So, we are very bullish on K-12. Thank you, Tania. And let me close by saying I would like to acknowledge first, the incredible dedication of our co-workers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, partners and all of our CDW stakeholders, particularly this quarter, our first quarter delivering over $5 billion in sales, an extraordinary quarter, supporting our customers. Thank you all. Thank you also to our customers for the great privilege and opportunity to serve you. And to our investors and analysts participating in the call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Collin Kebo",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with more detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8, consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, up 17.9% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 16.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales increased more than $0.5 billion or 11.2%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 4.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were stronger than expected reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the rebound was sharper than expected in several channels, most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Corporate, Small Business and CDW Canada all delivered very healthy double-digit growth versus 2020 and are up versus 2019. So, the strong growth reflects more than easy comparisons. As Chris mentioned, education momentum continued, delivering the fourth consecutive quarter of over $1 billion of net sales. On the supply side, while the backlog increased several hundred million dollars in the second quarter, the team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages and supporting stronger than expected demand, so the backlog did not increase even more. Gross profit for the quarter was $883 million, an increase of 18.2%. Gross margin was 17.2%, up approximately 10 basis points versus last year primarily driven by an increase in the mix of net service contract revenue, primarily software-as-a-service and strong professional services performance, partially offset by overlapping higher margin configuration services for the Census project last year. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9, non-GAAP SG&A increased 13.6%. The increase was primarily driven by payroll costs, including sales compensation, which moves with gross profit growth; performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals; and investments in the business, including coworker count to drive our strategy. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was 10,666. Coworker count increased 480 from the first quarter and 618 from the prior year. The increase in coworker count reflects organic and inorganic investments to support high growth solution areas and our digital transformation. GAAP operating income was $370 million, up 30.5%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $418 million, up 23.6%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.1%. Moving to Slide 10, interest expense was $36 million, down 10.6%. The decrease was primarily due to savings from last year's refinancing, a lower LIBOR rate and lower revolving credit facility borrowings. Other income reflects $36 million from the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investment. Proceeds from the sale were excluded from non-GAAP metrics. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26.2%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $97 million compared to $56 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.4% and up 50 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to higher foreign taxes. As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $142 million GAAP net income per share, was $1.93, up 47.4%. Our non-GAAP net income was $286 million in the quarter, up 27%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.02, up 29.3% from last year. Turning to first half results on Slides 14 through 19, net sales were $10 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 14.9% on an average daily sales basis as we had one fewer selling day in the first half of 2021. The one fewer selling day will be made up in Q4 when we have one extra selling day compared to the prior year. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, first half consolidated net sales were 13.6% higher than the prior year. Gross profit was $1.7 billion up 11.6% and gross profit margin was 16.8% down approximately 40 basis points. Operating income was $693 million and non-GAAP operating income was $786 million, up 22.4%. Net income was $507 million, and non-GAAP net income was $536 million, up 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $3.76, up 27.9%. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 20, at June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $0.5 billion and net debt was $3.4 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $110 million, as shown on Slide 21. This was lighter than a typical first half but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and one-time items. Year-to-date, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms. Additionally, working capital increases during periods of rapid growth and we made strategic investments in inventory to support customers during this choppy supply environment. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, returning $433 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $377 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $170 per share. Moving to Slide 22, the 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 4 days from last year's second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by improved accounts receivable collection performance. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 23, our priorities remain the same: first, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the second quarter at 2.1x, up 0.4 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Focal Point and Amplified IT are great examples. And fourth, we turn excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5x to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash returned to shareholders. We now expect to return over $1.7 billion to shareholders in 2021, including at least $1.5 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. This $0.5 billion increase from last quarter's comments reflects our confidence in the cash flow generation and earnings power of the business. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets, and we will continue to deploy capital for M&A that passes our screens. Of course, as we always do, we will closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity and M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 24, the current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers and in CDW Canada. On the supply side, visibility remains a challenge. Notebooks, displays, docking stations, certain infrastructure hardware, including networking and servers are constrained, resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog. With the exception of Chromebooks, the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call, and most vendor partners do not expect the situation to improve in the second half. With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 5%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 425 to 500 basis points faster than the market in constant currency including the contribution from Focal Point. Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 80 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the strong mid-teens, call it, 16% to 16.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 70 basis points to earnings per share growth. The updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.35 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter, the 2015 to 2019 5-year average sequential increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis was approximately 4%, and we expect this year's third quarter to be in line with normal seasonality, which equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow low double digits. Our updated outlook for the balance of the year assumes modest growth in the backlog. If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the second half and into 2022. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over-delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of free cash flow, including capital expenditures and the cash conversion cycle, can also be found on Slide 25. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Tamia to open it up for questions. Can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up? Thank you. Yes, Matt, I would just add in terms of the composition of the growth in the backlog. As Chris said, notebook certainly contributed to that with Chromebooks getting better, but we did see backlog growth in some of the other areas in the transactional part of the business, things like displays and panels and monitors, things like that. And then we also saw the backlog increase across some infrastructure products. Yes, I'm happy to take that. It's really a variety of initiatives, both organically and inorganically. On the organic side, we continue to invest behind the areas solutions areas that are particularly high value to our customers, so customer-facing coworkers and technical areas, both on the presales and the service delivery side. I think you began to see some of the fruits of those investments in the second quarter as we referenced the success that we were having in the professional services part of the business. We are also making investments in our own digital transformation into our own infrastructure to drive productivity with our sales force and how we interact with customers and just how we scale and operate the business more efficiently. Thanks, Lexi. Yes, Katy, we're really not providing more detail on Q3 intra-quarter beyond what we shared in the comments, which was we continue to see strong activity and momentum, particularly with commercial customers and in CDW Canada. And on the supply side, we are expecting modest growth in the backlog as we move throughout the year. Thanks, Katy. Yes. Sure, Chris. Maybe I'll just add a little bit on to the double ordering comment as well, Jim. I think also, when you think about what the majority of our customers are ordering, they are not widgets. It's customized to the specs of a large corporate customer or the needs of the school district. And the thought that you're going to place an order like that with multiple vendors, I think, is low. At very small and \u2013 a small office, home office customer that needs 20 notebooks, it's impossible that there is some double ordering going on there. Yes. But I think overall, when you look at the backlog, we feel pretty good that those are firm orders sitting in the backlog. The comment I'll make actually gets into your next one. What we have seen, though, is what I would call an order pull-forward-where customers are placing orders sooner than they might normally because of the supply environment or to try to get ahead of expected price increases from our OEM vendor partners. So sitting in that backlog is a little bit of a pull-forward. And I think that's getting to your question around the air pocket. I guess the way I think about it is there is a little bit of a hedge here. To the extent that there may then be a little bit of a lull in the ordering. If, at some point in the future, orders return to a normal timing and flow pattern, we would also then have the flush of the backlog at some point in time. So I think maybe that's one way to think about it. Thanks, Jim. Yes. Shannon, from a cash flow perspective, obviously, as the business experiences rapid growth, we do make an investment in working capital, and you saw some of that in the quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have intentionally been carrying higher inventory levels, specifically customer-specific inventory to help them work through rollouts of their projects. So, I think as long as we are in this choppy supply environment, I would expect inventory to be running higher than typical levels. As it relates to our total free cash flow, we were down in the first half of the year relative to a normal first half of the year. I would attribute that, though, mostly to the strong timing and things we benefit from in the prior year and not indicative of any type of change in the future free cash flow generation capability of the business. Yes. Ruplu, if you think about it, the gross margin improved sequentially. We went from a 16.4% to 17.2%. So, that was 80 basis points. Now we have a variable cost structure, so, not all of that passes to the operating margin. I would say that there are some elements of seasonality in that. When you think about \u2013 there is a software vendor, a big partner of ours who has a fiscal year end in June. And as we mentioned in our comments, we had very strong software results and very strong cloud and Software as a Service results. So, we did benefit seasonally from mixing into some netted down items there that I wouldn't expect to recur at necessarily the same pace in the second half of the year. And then also our partner funding improved a bit sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Our partners reimburse some of our advertising. And as we increased our advertising investment sequentially, you saw part of that sitting in the gross margin. So, I think most of the increase then is primarily explained by the gross margin. And then in terms of how you think about the back half of the year, I just \u2013 the comment I made to Matt earlier in the call around we are continuing to invest in the business, and that co-worker count gets layered in and you will have full quarter's worth of that expense coming up in subsequent quarters. Thanks Ruplu. Hi. Good morning, Keith. We typically would not provide that level of granularity with our acquisitions. I guess it's \u2013 while strategically important and of high value to our customers and sellers, it is a services business. So, in terms of just absolute magnitude of contribution to CDW, I would say the impact will be relatively small. And as we stated in the press release on Monday, I expect it not to have a material impact to earnings for the full year. I guess what I would say, though, is, I mean, if you look at the investments we have been making over the past couple of quarters, we have been picking up the services businesses that are of high value to our customers. And I think collectively, they are contributing to some of the gross margin strength, and you saw that in the second quarter, and we commented on it. So, I wouldn't call out anything specifically, but would just say, in aggregate, the investments we are making behind the services businesses in the high-growth areas that our value to our customers are helping the margin. In terms of contribution to our sales growth, Keith? Yes. That's a difficult question to answer at a portfolio level, because much of what we sell doesn't have a hardware unit associated with it, right, when you think about software, services, cloud and then you see things like value shifting to the software for integrated solutions. But maybe one way to think about it is if I pick a big category like client devices, which were up high teens in the quarter, we saw balanced growth in terms of both units and ASPs, average selling price, and that was true for most customer end markets. So, it's a combination of both unit growth and pricing. Yes. Samik, thanks for joining the call and welcome. We haven't provided multiyear thoughts \u2013 just a view for the year. And you can see for the full year, we continue to believe we will deliver a mid-7 operating margin. So, you can then think about those investments being funded within the context of that, those thoughts around the operating margin. Yes. I think you can do the math, given the thoughts on the guide for the third quarter and then what's left over for the fourth quarter. I would just be careful about your thoughts on the backlog. As we said, we don't assume an improvement in the backlog at our full year modeling thoughts. So, that's not captured. And if the backlog were to get worked down, that would be upside to the outlook. And I think when you run the math, on what the implied Q4 growth rate is year-over-year, that's again just a reflection of some of the big overlaps that we have been talking about, specifically within education in the fourth quarter. Last year, we had the large Mississippi Department of Education deal, and obviously, a big contribution from the census that the devices came back. Okay. Thank you, Samik."

I also want to remind you that this conference call is the property of CDW and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without specific written permission from the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. We had a strong first quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the first quarter, net sales were $4.8 billion, 12% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the first quarter of 2021 than 2020, and up 10.9% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 5.1% to $795 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $368 million, an increase of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26. 2% on a reported basis and up 25.3% in constant currency. The diversity of our end markets and solutions portfolio continued to serve us well,  providing balance and driving our strong results as we overlap last year's end-of-quarter surge in demand for remote solutions. During the first quarter, we saw early signs of recovery as customers became more optimistic about the macroeconomic environment due to lower COVID case count, higher vaccination rates and new government stimulus. Customer spending and channels most impacted by COVID last year rebounded. We continue to help customers with remote enablement, resource optimization, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. This past quarter, customers allocated more technology spend to infrastructure needs, driving growth for our solutions portfolio. Customers were focused on investments for the future, reconfiguring how they interact customers, strengthening hybrid environments, industrializing remote enablement and restarting projects that had been delayed due to COVID. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. Customers choose CDW for 3 simple reasons. First, customers want a partner who know their business and their industry. Second, customers want to partner with broad and deep technical capabilities. And third, they want a partner who is focused on the optimal outcome, one who is agnostic across brand, technology and consumption model and has an informed opinion. These reasons are fundamental to why CDW outperformed in the first quarter and will continue to win in the marketplace. During the first quarter, we remained focused on executing against our strategy and investing in high relevance and high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including our acquisition of Amplified IT. Amplified IT is a Google premium education partner and a leading provider of cloud-based services, solutions and software for education customers and has been a partner of CDW since 2016. We share a similar culture that puts customers first, and together, we will accelerate our work to help customers' schools achieve great educational outcomes through technology. Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers' extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. Supply constraints and availability for client devices and some infrastructure products have been more challenging since the first quarter ended.  Disruption has been caused by both component availability issues and supply chain logistical issues. The supply situation is fluid. Constraints will likely continue through the second half of the year and potentially into next year. Now let's take a deeper look at first quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 4% as customer spend continued to recover. Customer expectations that a hybrid environment will become the future work model drove investments in notebooks and other remote enablement tools, while desktop and video sales declined. Solutions performance was flat, a significant improvement versus the previous quarter as net comm and data center projects returned. Small Business delivered strong growth, increasing 12% as optimism improved. Our team helped customers with remote enablement, netcomm and data center projects, leading to solid growth in both transactional and solution spend. Net sales for our government channel decreased high single digit. Federal declined mid-single digits. However, excluding our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau, Federal grew high single digits, led by engagements for the Department of Defense across both transactional and solutions categories. The state and local channel decreased high single digits. Customers paused their spending as they took a wait-and-see approach during the quarter for a stimulus support under the new administration. Education again grew triple digits, achieving over 100% growth, powered by K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access as well as ways to address learning loss, which drove strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers turn to us for holistic capabilities and expertise to help schools enable a variety of learning models, remote, hybrid, blended and in-person. Higher ed increased low single digits. Growth slowed versus prior quarters as customers assess their plans to invest stimulus funding to prepare for returning students. Healthcare declined 2%, a meaningful improvement to prior quarters. Customers were more optimistic due to increased income generated from the return to elective procedures and the accelerated vaccination pace. Solutions returned to growth driven by customers refreshing and updating their data centers. Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, the U.K. team increased net sales double digits, and the Canada team drove high single-digit growth. Strong results for both markets were driven by fiscal year-end government spending as well as continued investment by health care and education customers. Our first quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers. Transactions increased strong double digits and solutions returned to growth, increasing low single digits. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth across all channels, leading to 26% client device growth. Software declined high single digits due to a decline in software licenses, but software gross profit growth remains solid. While services decreased low single digits when adjusted for overlapping the contribution from the Census project last year, services grew strong double digits, driven by strength in our professional and managed services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in Infrastructure as a Service, security, productivity and collaboration. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflects the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. And the final driver of our performance is our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share 2 examples of our strategy in action and how we help customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped a customer that enables digital platforms to utilize natural language processing and machine learning to upgrade its technology infrastructure after it had been postponed due to COVID last spring. In early 2020, our account manager was working with the customer's technology team on a server upgrade at its primary data center. COVID hit and the customer froze all capital expenditures.  Our account manager did a great job nurturing the relationship so that CDW is well positioned to help our customer when the project resumed. Last quarter, the customer was more optimistic about its future prospects and ready to proceed. It got access to capital and wanted to take advantage of its employees still working remotely. The project scope was expanded to upgrade all infrastructure, security, networking, storage, servers and software at its headquarters and its primary data center. The customer relied heavily on our team for its expertise to design and implement the complex solutions. In 2020, customers had to react quickly to the impact of COVID. In 2021, we see that our customers are being strategic and proactively looking to technology to be more effective and efficient in a post-COVID world. As I shared earlier, we acquired Amplified IT at the end of the first quarter. We are excited about the opportunity to go to market together with our combined strengths and to orchestrate complete hardware, software, services and cloud solutions that leverage our full stack capabilities and drive full outcomes for and deep engagement with our education customers. We started to execute against this vision immediately. CDW's relationships and extensive contract vehicles with the State Department of Education enabled the customer frictionless access to Amplified IT's portfolio. The school system needed to enhance its communication and collaboration tools to service community in different learning formats, so it centralized and standardized its technology with the help of Amplified IT and CDW to provide the right tools and support to its teachers and students across approximately 250 schools. We are excited about the addition of Amplified IT and see significant opportunity ahead. These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate our relentless focus on customer service, the importance of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I'm so proud of the way that our teams continue to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. We expect our office coworkers to continue to be remote until at least this fall, with plans underway by our ReunITe team to reimagine our future of work to continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can. Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are increasing our outlook for both the U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market growth to be about 4% and our top line to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. For the second quarter, we are encouraged about customer demand to date and how our teams are executing. That said, we are cautious about the supply environment, which, as I mentioned, has become more challenged since the end of the first quarter.  While there are other wildcards such as new COVID variants, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects of the business have never been higher. Technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable profitable growth. CDW's role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition. Before I turn the call over to Collin for his comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition plans we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Collin for his contributions to CDW over the past 13 years and his strong leadership as our CFO since 2018. Collin has played a significant role in our evolution and consistent market-leading growth as a public company, and he has established a truly best-in-class finance team. On a personal note, it's been wonderful to be a close colleague of Collin's over 13 years, and I've greatly appreciated his partnership. We are also appreciative of Collin's commitment to support CDW in the search for his successor and to remain on the Board to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn it over to Collin.\nCollin Kebo: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My 13 years at CDW have been among the most rewarding of my career, and I want to thank you, the leadership team and all coworkers for making CDW so special. I also want to thank the finance team for bringing it every day. I'll miss CDW, but I'm confident the company has never been stronger and its best days are ahead. Following a successful transition, I'm looking forward to retiring so I can spend more time with family and helping others. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion, up 10.2% on a reported basis and 12% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 3.9% versus the fourth quarter. First quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the timing and slope of the recovery was better than expected in several channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Small Business, CDW Canada and CDW U.K. all delivered strong growth and declines in Corporate and Healthcare improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter. On the supply side, our team did a great job navigating the challenging environment, leveraging our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships and was able to work down a portion of the backlog in Chromebooks, which was higher than normal coming into the year. This supply, coupled with continued strong demand from education customers, resulted in education net sales doubling compared to the prior year. Gross profit for the quarter was $795 million, an increase of 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.8% on an average daily sales basis. Gross margin was 16.4%, down 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by lower product margin, including notebook mix and rate and overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year, partially offset by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased 5.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and entertainment expense. If you recall, last year, we increased our credit loss reserve as a result of the expected impact of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher investments in coworkers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 10,186. Coworker count increased 204 from the fourth quarter, driven by an increase of approximately 120 customer-facing coworkers, including over 40 from Amplified IT. The increase in coworker count reflects investments to support high-growth solution areas and the digital transformation of our own business. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 82, driven by organic and inorganic investments in coworkers to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation, partially offset by cost management actions in 2020. GAAP operating income was $323 million, up 31.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $368 million, up 21%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%, a record high margin for our first quarter, reflecting the benefit of our variable cost structure. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 6.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from last year's refinancing, partially offset by notes issued in April of 2020. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 19.5%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $44 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to lower global intangible low-taxed income and lower nondeductible expenses. As you can see on Slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 143 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.63, up 40.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $249 million in the quarter, up 24.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $879 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $101 million, as shown on Slide 15. This was lighter than a typical first quarter, but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. In Q1, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms and made payments related to the Census. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, purchasing Amplified IT and returning $415 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $358 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $148 per share. Moving to Slide 16. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 22 days, up 2 days from last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 2-day increase in DIO as we made investments in inventory to support customers through the choppy supply environment. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 17. Our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the first quarter at 2x, up 0.3 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Amplified IT that Chris highlighted is a great example of this. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We continue to expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 18. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we are encouraged by the activity and building momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers, where April writings for corporate and small business were up healthy double digits on a year-over-year basis. We're also seeing good activity at CDW Canada and CDW U.K. On the supply side, uncertainty has increased since the first quarter. Our backlog is higher than normal and increasing with lead times extending and visibility challenged at suppliers. Notebooks, certain Chromebooks, displays and pockets of infrastructure hardware are becoming more constrained. Net demand, particularly with commercial customers, feels stronger than 3 months ago, but supply is more challenged. With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 4%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency, including the contribution from Amplified IT.  Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 60 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the low double digits, call it, 11% to 11.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 50 basis points to earnings per share growth. This updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.30 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate are unchanged from last quarter and can be found on Page 19. Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. On the February earnings call, we did not provide a first half, second half sales split as we typically would because of the uncertainty. Based on our current assessment, we expect the split to be approximately 48.5% to 49% first half, 51.5% to 51% second half. This assumes a slight sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis and equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth in the second quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth. If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the next 3 quarters and potentially into 2022. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 20. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. We continue to expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. As we mentioned before, we believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cristal to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Collin, best of luck on your retirement. It's really been a pleasure working with you. I guess maybe first question, this is the one I'm getting asked by clients a lot. Please step back and talk a little bit of what happened to gross margin, at least on a sequential basis, I'll hold on the year-over-year. But what drove the drop on a sequential basis, the lowest we've seen in a while. And then how will be gross margins progressing as we go through the year?\nCollin Kebo: Thanks, Amit. On both the year-over-year and sequential basis, there's some recurring things. I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate. Obviously, we've had strong growth in Chromebooks in education. The other thing that happened in the quarter was really strong growth in our U.K. and Canadian businesses. It was a fiscal year-end for many of their public customers. We had a very strong fiscal year end in those markets, and a lot of those deals tended to be in client devices. So you have public and client device end market mix internationally. In the previous quarter, Q4 benefited from strong configuration services as we decommissioned the majority of the devices we had from the Census Device as a Service offering last year. A little of that spilled over into the first quarter, but for the most part, it was done. As you think about gross margin, as you know, we don't provide an outlook. It can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on a variety of factors. We do tend to focus on the NGLI margin because of our variable cost structure, and that's more variable. But if I can just share some thoughts on some of the puts and takes to gross margin as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think from a tailwind perspective, I would expect the longer-term secular trend to 100% gross margin items and as well as us continuing to grow our higher-margin services businesses. In terms of headwinds, we've talked about this for some time, but there's hardware mix, and particularly within the hardware mix, client devices and Chromebooks. And then from a product margin perspective, I think some things to think about, there's that continuous commoditization that you can see. I think we went through a unique period over the past couple of quarters where we saw customers prioritizing speed and execution over price. We're beginning to move into what I would describe as a more normalized customer behavior environment where customers are willing to wait a little bit longer and prioritize price over speed because the urgency and kind of existential threat of the pandemic in business continuity isn't as great as it was just a few quarters ago. From an OEM perspective, obviously, there's some supply challenges out there and OEMs aren't getting as aggressive on special pricing programs as they might with a channel with more normalized environment. So I think you have a lot of things going on there.  We have been through cycles like this before. I'd point to the 2018 to 2019 time frame, where our top line ticks up into the high single digits or even low double digits as we sell a lot of hardware, we exceed our 200 to 300 basis point premium by a meaningful amount, but gross margin has a '16 handle on it. And I think that's part of the power of the business model is that we pivot to where the profitable growth is, and that's why we do focus on non-GAAP operating income and EPS and free cash flow.\nAmit Daryanani: That is really helpful. And if I can just follow up with Chris on a different topic. Chris, you've seen this hardware business grow double digit, software and services is lagging somewhat. I'm curious, is this something normal that you would expect as we are at the onset of a macro cyclical recovery? And perhaps as IT budgets become more normalized, should we expect the software and services business to start growing in line with or faster than CDW averages, maybe by the end of the year or something? But just curious how you stack the hardware versus software and services as you go forward.\nChris Leahy: Yes. One thing, Amit. And I'd say, look, as customers continue to work through their budgets and keep a close eye on the macro environment, the vaccine rollout, that's really going to dictate where they're spending and if we continue to see this uptick in hardware refresh. In terms of software, look, that can be fairly lumpy as we've talked about before. Depending on the mix of software, this quarter, we saw license -- shorter-term licenses and licenses not as strong, but I'll tell you, SaaS continues to be quite strong across the portfolio. So we don't expect software to start to diminish as we move forward in the year, notwithstanding a hardware refresh. It's still critically important, obviously, to the full stack. So I think we'll continue to see software strong. It's just going to bounce around depending on what's being bought and whether or not it's netted down.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect, and congrats on a nice quarter.\nChris Leahy: Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Just a clarification first. I think IDC forecast hardware or software both of north of 6% at this point. Why do you think 4% is the appropriate forecast? And if you think about the increase since 3 months ago, is it largely PC and Chromebook driven? Or is it more broad-based than that? And then I have a follow-up.\nChris Leahy: Okay. Katy, it's Chris. I'll take that. I think I heard -- you cut out for a minute, but I think the question was on the IT market rate of growth given some of the forecasts out there. And as you know, we triangulate from a variety of sources. We do customer input partner inputs the CIO and VAR surveys and the IDCs and Gartners. And I'd share a couple of thoughts. I think the forecast tend to lag current market conditions for the third-party analysts. And while demand feels very healthy, I'm not sure how many of the external forecasts are incorporating the impact of supply chain that we've talked about. And the CIO surveys, if you focus on that, they are a little more cautious than some of the others. So we feel pretty confident that we've landed on a growth rate that feels right, right now. But of course, as we go through the year, as we always do, we'll update based on what we see the changes in the market.\nKaty Huberty: And is the increase, in your mind, largely PC-driven? Or is it more broad-based than that?\nChris Leahy: I would say it's overweighted to -- it's overweighted to hardware and clients, but it's really broadly driven. The demand is across both transactional and solutions, and that's driving the market rate of growth in our view.\nKaty Huberty: And Collin, just a follow-up for you. You mentioned strong writings growth in the April quarter. Can you just talk about the gap in the last 3 months or so between writings growth and revenue growth and whether that gap increased as you moved into April given the supply constraints?\nCollin Kebo: Yes, Katy. What I would say is we came into the year with a higher-than-normal backlog. And while there were some ups and downs as we went through the quarter and some ups and downs by end market, by the time we ended the first quarter, the backlog was relatively consistent with where it was at the beginning of the year. So that would tell you that writings in sales and sales generally kept pace with each other. Where we've seen the backlog increase has been more subsequent to the end of the first quarter, and that would tell us that we're writing well ahead of shipments.\nKaty Huberty: Okay. Congratulations on retirement, Collin.\nCollin Kebo: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: I was just wondering with regard -- I know you touched on it a little bit during the call, but stimulus, how are you thinking about the benefits? I mean there's a significant amount of money that's going to be, I guess, has, and will be flooding into education. I think government is going to have a fair amount of funding as well. So as you look ahead, given your customer mix in that, how are you thinking about stimulus maybe through -- and how long do you think it will continue to benefit, I guess?\nChris Leahy: Yes. That's a great question, Shannon. It will be a tailwind in our mind for sure. I think about it a little bit like getting an elephant through the snake. It takes some time to actually get it moving through the system. So when you think about the 3 different stimulus acts that have been passed last March and then last December and then most recently in March, there are funds that have been available for state and local K-12 and Healthcare, in particular, where we see the most benefit for our customers. And we have a team actually that goes through the stimulus bills and understands where the dollars are going and frankly, help our customers quite a bit in understanding how and where and when they can spend their dollars. So we see it as an absolute tailwind and our customers do look to us to help understand how best to utilize those funds. If you look at the most recent of the American Rescue Plan in March, there's about $350 billion going to state and local and $130 billion going to K-12. So we certainly look forward to helping them use those and invest in technology as they come out of the current environment.\nShannon Cross: Are there any specific areas that are targeted within stimulus? I mean is it continued Chromebook sales? Or will we see maybe a move up the stack from a hardware perspective?\nChris Leahy: So yes, if we take K-12 for example. We go to market with what we call customer-centric solutions. So we're focused on those areas that are most strategic and important to our customers. K-12, for example. Think of classroom transformation, think of school-facing, think of networking augmentation. So certainly, after the stack, starting with a consultative role in a design role and then bringing to bear our implementation, integration and management capabilities. But we -- K-12 really turns to CDW and state and local health care, who are going to be beneficiaries of the stimulus, for the holistic capabilities that we bring to bear. And at the end of the day, that actually helps them maximize the dollars they can use through stimulus because we know how to work those dollars through the needle.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Chris, I wanted to start on the growth premium versus the market, which you're raising today. And I think coming out of the last cycle, the growth premium contracted. So I'm wondering, is the raise today more reflective of device demand remaining stronger for longer? Or do you think that you're noticing structural changes versus the last cycle that are enabling you to stay at an elevated growth premium regardless of product cycles?\nChris Leahy: Well, our premium does tend to be 200 to 300 basis points higher than the market when we start the year. We hold ourselves accountable for that. And when we sell a lot of hardware, as you know, which is recognized at full revenue, we tend to outperform that premium. So we brought it up to 300 to 400 basis points. When you think about the mix of hardware, that seems to make a lot of sense to us. So if I just go through the math. If we take Census out of the baseline, which contribute about 2 -- 200 to 240 basis points to premium last year, we're looking at a good 500 to 600 basis points this year by bringing our premium up those 100 basis points. So when you ask about whether or not we, as I said, kind of durable forecast or outlook for outperformance, I would say it really depends on the mix. In years where we have high hardware, we tend to outperform because we recognize much of what we sell on a full net sales basis. In times when we have slower sales of hardware, and we have more netted down items, that's when we'll see the top line more muted. So we're hesitant to commit to a higher premium generally because of the mix of the business. And the beauty of the model is exactly that mix of the business. We've got the full range of IT products and we go where our customers need them when they need us. So I don't see us bringing that up to a higher level at any point soon, but rather toggling to where our customers need us.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. And maybe as a follow-up, Collin, congrats, and I'm sure there's going to be some aspects of the job that you won't miss like this one where I'm going to beat a dead horse on gross margin. But I do have to ask. I mean I know there's notebook demand, but devices have been strong for some time. Sequentially, SMB and international grew most, which are among the higher gross margin segments. But this gross margin compression is so much more than normal. So I guess the question would be, on a like-for-like product basis, are you seeing pressure on gross margin? And why? Is there inflation or price increases that you're eating more of or sharing in some of the pain that's helping you to gain some share?\nCollin Kebo: Yes, Adam. I mean, we -- first, thank you. You're right. This is one of the parts of the job that I won't miss down the road. But putting all the mix issues aside, we are seeing some product margin compression in certain categories. And just to go a little bit deeper on some of the comments I've made before. Again, I just -- I think 2020 was really unique in the way that customers were prioritizing speed and execution overtaking every last basis point off the table in terms of their IT buying behavior. And I think now that we're moving into a different phase of the pandemic where that mission-critical nature of getting that IT purchase as quickly as possible just isn't there, we're seeing a return to kind of some of that more normal customer buying behavior. I would characterize the competitive environment as competitive, not irrational, but we compete in a highly competitive marketplace. From an OEM perspective, they are obviously wrestling with higher input costs and supply challenges, right? And so because of that -- that drives a couple of things. One, they are not incentivized to aggressively invest as much in the channel and special pricing programs and things like that, that they might in a more normal supply environment and a more normal competitive environment where they're battling it out to gain share. And in some instances, they're taking those higher costs and passing them along in the form of price increases. Now we do work on a cost-plus model, as we've talked about over the years. But if you just think about the math of the way a price increase works, if, for argument's sake, we make $100 per unit of gross profit on a notebook. And that notebook price goes up by 5% or 10%, that is going to be a lower reported gross margin percentage. So I think those are some of the dynamics that are driving some of the changes we're seeing on product margin currently versus some of the preceding quarters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Cabral: Collin, I also wanted to extend my congratulations on your retirement, all the best going forward. Chris, I guess, good to hear some momentum coming back into the business on the infrastructure side. I guess I'm wondering if you could expand a little more on what you're seeing underneath there and talk about trends across the data center in categories like server, storage, netcomm? And I guess taking a step back, I'd be curious for your perspective on just how customers are balancing the desire to refresh or invest in their on-prem footprint versus this push to accelerate the move toward the public cloud going forward?\nChris Leahy: It's -- let me start with a step back. If you think across our customers, you hear quite a bit about when people are going back or returning to the office. And I'll tell you, while certainly there you see in the news a couple of large organizations that are returning to the office pretty quickly in the summer, most of our customers around -- across Commercial and Small Business are still, I'd say, not rushing. They're still planning and they're still a little cautious because they've got employees on both sides of the spectrum. Those who want to get back and those who frankly aren't yet ready to get back. So first, I would just say we're in a time right now where as the vaccination pace might accelerate and we see what happens over the next couple of years. We've got to be patient for a couple of months. All that said, clearly, the hybrid world is here to stay and our customers are thinking and planning around how to have flexible -- where people are now calling Hyflex environment, hybrid and flexible environment.  And so we are in the -- we are still planning with them. We are seeing some customers that have had just old infrastructure and a real need to upgrade get to it over the past couple of months. But we are still heavily in the phase of, I'll call it, assessment to optimize, whether old plans to upgrade throughout the window and we start to move more to cloud, whether customers think more strongly about on-prem cloud-like solutions, which are now really readily available and of great interest. So what I would say, Matt, is that we're still -- customers are still assessing and they're being more reflective. As Collin mentioned, last year, there was just a kind of a rush to get business continuity. And now there's a more measured, reflective strategic approach on what's going to be durable competitive advantage for the long term. So what does that all mean? We have seen customers spending more on infrastructure, hardware infrastructure. Obviously, cloud is doing really quite well. We saw a server uptick. Storage is getting stronger. One would expect we'd see netcomm really come to life later in the year or midyear as customers are heading back to the office. But there's -- on-prem hardware is not going to go away, it's just what's going to be most optimal. And as I said, customers are really weighing the benefits right now.\nMatt Cabral: That's really helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the commentary for the second quarter. And I think I heard slight sequential growth, and I know we're coming off of a really strong first quarter base. I guess if I look back prior to last year, the business was typically up much more meaningfully from the first quarter to the second quarter. So I'm wondering if you could just help bridge the gap a little bit and just speak to how much is maybe normalization on the education side or some of the supply challenges versus just the trajectory in the wider business?\nCollin Kebo: Yes, I would say abnormal education seasonality is the single biggest driver here. If you look historically what has driven the increase in sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, education is, by far, the number one factor when you look across our end markets. So we just come into the typical education peak season with a much stronger base. And we've talked about several quarters now of unusual or abnormal education seasonality. So I would say that's the first driver. I touched on a couple of other ones in my prepared comments. But again, just an unusually strong public year-end finish in the U.K. and Canada. I know it's public year-end every year in the first quarter, but we just had a particularly strong finish this year. And then we also carried a little bit of Census revenue in the first quarter as we completed the device to decommissioning. We are completely done with that and have no Census revenue going forward. I think the other thing that I would think about, and I made this comment in one of the answers earlier, was that our backlog was relatively unchanged over the course of the first quarter. If supply is more resilient than we think -- actually, I don't think it is. But if supply is more resilient and we can begin whittling down that backlog or if demand is even greater, and supply can keep up with that greater demand, I think that could provide some upside in terms of sequential growth and into the back half of the year. We just don't have the visibility at this point, though, to build that confidence on supply into the full year outlook and into the second quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Collin, it was a pleasure working with you and wishing you the best for your retirement. My first question is for you as well. Can you give us some details on CapEx spend this year? What areas are you investing in? And what utilization are your distribution centers running at? And at what point would you need to invest in another facility?\nCollin Kebo: Thanks, Ruplu. In terms of our own CapEx, again, we talked about this a little bit on the call. But a lot of that is going into our own digital transformation, and that can be better tools for our sellers, more AI, how our customers interact with CDW and making those transactions more frictionless as well as investments we're making in supply chain, both resiliency as well as flexibility. So I would think about CapEx going across those buckets. In terms of adding another distribution center, I don't know that in the next few years, we would have a -- build another 0.5 million square foot distribution center. I think we would look at more dynamic and flexible models, working with third-party logistics organizations and really thinking through how to optimize our footprint across the U.S. from a supply chain perspective. Oh, and I think you had a question on utilization. Yes. Look, the distribution centers are busy. There's no doubt about that. Part of that is us flexing our muscles and where we can, bringing inventory in and configuring that and staging it for our customers and helping them through this choppy environment. So there is some capacity there. It's tight. And again, I think we would use more of a flexible model and more of a renting space in the short term as we need it until we get a better sense of what supply and demand look like over the longer term.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: My second question is for Chris. What percent of your coworkers are currently working from home? And given certain regions are going back into lockdowns, I mean, how do you think about that? And is the updated revenue guidance for the year that you gave this morning, is that dependent on a certain percent of coworkers being able to go back into the customer sites and get acceptance for projects? So is the mix of coworkers working from home versus being able to travel impact the revenue for the full year?\nChris Leahy: Thanks for the question. Let me start with the second part first. Our guidance isn't dependent on when or how many people we get back into the office or going on to customer sites. So we've really done a great job. The team has done a great job of staying connected and staying productive. So we're not -- it's not dependent on that. In terms of going back to the office and how we think about that, a couple of things. First of all, we have coworkers on both ends of the spectrum. As I mentioned before, as most companies do, we've got some who are really eager to be back and some who are still cautious until we get through the pandemic more fully. So what we've done is we've created opportunities for customer -- for coworkers to come together and have social and networking time in a safe way. We've also given guidance to our coworkers who are customer-facing around getting together with customers who would like to get together again in a safe way, and that started to happen. We also have customers who are very comfortable with our service provision in a remote way, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic. But we also have customers who are now opening up and allowing us back on site. We have bases that are opening, et cetera. So I guess I'd say, look, we're doing very well from a productivity and connectivity perspective. We are starting to get together with customers in-person. And you can imagine it depends on what's happening within each state, for example, or each country. I think the U.K. just had their garden pubs open, and that was a big event and customers do want to get together. But we're going to do this right. We don't really want to do this with fits and starts. That's really the key for us. We want to be able to have our coworkers come back together in a way that is -- continues our highly engaged and high-performing culture and keeps the customer at the center of how we actually work together so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment.\nJim Suva: As you start to see some mid- and small-sized businesses coming back to work and in-person meetings and in-person works, are you seeing that they are still very kind of PC notebook-centric weighted? Or are they going back to kind of pre-COVID mix level? Or any type of preference to what they're installing when they do come back to work?\nChris Leahy: I would say if you were to take a scale of 1 to 100, how many are actually back in work, we're still very much on the lower end of the spectrum. So we still have a very large number of customers who are continuing to work remotely. For those who are going -- have some folks going back into the office. What we're observing is a continued investment in mobile employees, the ability to be in the office on a flexible basis, the ability to move around the office and use the office in a different way. Now the question is, what work are you doing in the office? And do you need to have more -- even more collaboration spaces and the ability for your employees to have mobile devices that they can move around with and take home? So I would say our view is that the flexible hybrid work environment is what the preponderance of our customers expect to be in over the long term. And that includes notebooks, a higher density end of notebooks, obviously, more enterprise-level collaboration capabilities.  We do have some customers who are contemplating whether to have a desktop in the office and a notebook at home for coworkers, it really depends on the industry. Things like lockers and hoteling are really points of discussion now. But that's what we're seeing overall, if that's helpful.\nJim Suva: Great. And now that we're lapping 1 year of COVID, like for the education and government sectors, are they still very much needing to catch up and do a lot more PC and Chromebook installations? Or are they kind of this summer going to be in the procurement cycle for schools going back to school? Are they going to be like a little less notebook and Chromebook dependent? Or are they actually going to be more, because maybe there are some districts who are fully stocked and others who aren't?  Or are they not going to do more infrastructure? Just kind of curious of kind of what's your view for that.\nChris Leahy: Yes. I guess if I think about K-12 education, I'll start with K-12, there are a couple of things. Device demand continues to remain strong because there is such a gap to that one-on-one device ratio that schools are trying to get to for equity and access and also for something they're referring to as learning loss, these gaps that might have happened over the pandemic. So there's plenty of headroom for devices going forward. With regard to CDW, what we face are tough compares from last year. So if you think about our growth over last year, very tough compares, but the demand is strong.  The other thing I would say is, as we're going into the next school year, schools are figuring -- and we're working with schools to figure out how to create the most optimal classroom experience, and that would be a blended experience, hybrid experience, all in-class. Schools really have -- they're looking at the ways of learning that they can use technology within a classroom or outside the classroom but within the walls of the school in much more creative ways. So from an infrastructure, I call it networking and particular perspective, we would expect to see upticks there. And then think of audio and visual. The older interactive flat screen panels are getting old now, but there are newer availabilities of solutions that work better. So that's another opportunity to help really modernize the classroom. So net-net, demand will remain strong with regard to devices, but the opportunity for infrastructure, network augmentation and for video will be a good opportunity as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: I just wanted to ask another question regarding the client devices and the PC upgrade cycle that's going on 3 to 4 years now. There's been talk obviously at some point that leveling off or being down, but we're also seem to be lapping the 4-year anniversary when companies started to upgrade to Windows 10. And given the constraints out there, it seems like there's still backlog. So could you talk to the client devices and notebook upgrade cycle and your thoughts there?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Sure, Matt. Let me -- we'll talk a little bit about maybe tailwinds and headwinds. So when we think about tailwinds, certainly, the need for more remote devices, and we've talked a lot about that today, whether it's remote-enabled work or learning and device density. Then there are new use cases. We've seen a great uptick in Catalyst, for example, in terms of how our customers engage with their customers in new ways. So you've got demand from there. You've got leverage -- get the ability to leverage the stimulus. We've got those dollars flowing through. And then we also have our Corporate and Small Business segments that are recovering nicely, and the comparables over last year are pretty low. So we've got some positives in there. Then you mentioned the refresh, absolutely, 2017 and '18, we have seen and would expect to continue to see that refresh go on. So we are selling into that. On the headwind side, look, we had big overlaps over 2020 in some of our segments including K-12. And the economy is still a wildcard, though employment looks like it's picking up, and that's been quite helpful, frankly, in the Small Business space with regard to endpoint solutions. And then the last thing I would just emphasize is the headwinds and the challenges that we're facing. There's real lot visibility there. But otherwise, the demand for client devices continued to be strong.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. And just a last quick one regarding the headcount, you talked about, I think, 200 additional coworkers, including 40 from the acquisition. But are you looking to continue to expand your coworker count this year given the relatively strong outlook for demand?\nChris Leahy: Yes. We absolutely are going to continue to invest in our business, whether it's coworkers, other acquisitions or digital transformation, as Collin mentioned. So we certainly will continue to invest in our coworkers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast.\nKeith Housum: Collin, I'll echo a congratulations on retirement. In terms of this supply chain environment that we're currently in, does CDW have any pricing power, I guess, with some of its customers in the fact that it's just harder to get some of the product into their hands?\nCollin Kebo: No, Keith, I wouldn't think pricing power per se. I think the competitive advantage is probably more on the ability to secure supply to the tenants available and getting at least our fair share. I think ultimately, your ability to price through it is a function of the competitive environment and the customer's willingness to wait. And I think that's what's different now versus, say, 2, 3 quarters ago, where the customer wasn't willing or couldn't wait. So I don't know that there's a huge opportunity to pass along incremental pricing beyond what the market will bear is what I would say.\nKeith Housum: Fair enough. Fair enough. And in terms of the supply chain challenges that you're facing, are the challenges more on the logistical side? Or are they more on the components side that's going into the final products?\nCollin Kebo: I would say it's both. The components -- I mean, obviously, the processor shortage is well documented, but things like glass and -- it just -- all of the challenges associated with that. And then, again, the logistics challenges of ports and canals and natural disasters and all of those things. So it is really a confluence of events that are impacting supply.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Chris Leahy, President and CEO, for closing remarks.\nChris Leahy: Thank you. And thank you to everyone on the call today. I would like to really recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and they're extraordinarily committed approach to serving our customers, our partners and all of our CDW stakeholders. Our coworkers bring it every single day. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Brittany. I'll begin this morning with an overview of first quarter results and drivers of performance and share our updated thoughts on 2021. Collin will then take you through a more detailed look at our financials, capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. We had a strong first quarter. Our results demonstrate the balance and strength of CDW's business model and strategy. For the first quarter, net sales were $4.8 billion, 12% above last year on an average daily sales basis adjusted for the impact of 1 fewer business day in the first quarter of 2021 than 2020, and up 10.9% in constant currency. Gross profit increased 5.1% to $795 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $368 million, an increase of 21%. And non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26. 2% on a reported basis and up 25.3% in constant currency. The diversity of our end markets and solutions portfolio continued to serve us well,  providing balance and driving our strong results as we overlap last year's end-of-quarter surge in demand for remote solutions. During the first quarter, we saw early signs of recovery as customers became more optimistic about the macroeconomic environment due to lower COVID case count, higher vaccination rates and new government stimulus. Customer spending and channels most impacted by COVID last year rebounded. We continue to help customers with remote enablement, resource optimization, security, hybrid and cloud solutions and digital transformation. This past quarter, customers allocated more technology spend to infrastructure needs, driving growth for our solutions portfolio. Customers were focused on investments for the future, reconfiguring how they interact customers, strengthening hybrid environments, industrializing remote enablement and restarting projects that had been delayed due to COVID. We combined our services and broad solutions portfolio with our extensive technical knowledge and unique logistical and distribution capabilities to advise, design and orchestrate the best outcomes for our customers. Customers choose CDW for 3 simple reasons. First, customers want a partner who know their business and their industry. Second, customers want to partner with broad and deep technical capabilities. And third, they want a partner who is focused on the optimal outcome, one who is agnostic across brand, technology and consumption model and has an informed opinion. These reasons are fundamental to why CDW outperformed in the first quarter and will continue to win in the marketplace. During the first quarter, we remained focused on executing against our strategy and investing in high relevance and high-growth solutions and services capabilities, including our acquisition of Amplified IT. Amplified IT is a Google premium education partner and a leading provider of cloud-based services, solutions and software for education customers and has been a partner of CDW since 2016. We share a similar culture that puts customers first, and together, we will accelerate our work to help customers' schools achieve great educational outcomes through technology. Last quarter, we leveraged our distribution centers' extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate supply challenges. Supply constraints and availability for client devices and some infrastructure products have been more challenging since the first quarter ended.  Disruption has been caused by both component availability issues and supply chain logistical issues. The supply situation is fluid. Constraints will likely continue through the second half of the year and potentially into next year. Now let's take a deeper look at first quarter customer end market performance. Corporate declined 4% as customer spend continued to recover. Customer expectations that a hybrid environment will become the future work model drove investments in notebooks and other remote enablement tools, while desktop and video sales declined. Solutions performance was flat, a significant improvement versus the previous quarter as net comm and data center projects returned. Small Business delivered strong growth, increasing 12% as optimism improved. Our team helped customers with remote enablement, netcomm and data center projects, leading to solid growth in both transactional and solution spend. Net sales for our government channel decreased high single digit. Federal declined mid-single digits. However, excluding our Device as a Service solution for the U.S. Census Bureau, Federal grew high single digits, led by engagements for the Department of Defense across both transactional and solutions categories. The state and local channel decreased high single digits. Customers paused their spending as they took a wait-and-see approach during the quarter for a stimulus support under the new administration. Education again grew triple digits, achieving over 100% growth, powered by K-12. K-12 customers continued to focus on equity and access as well as ways to address learning loss, which drove strong transactional and solutions performance. Customers turn to us for holistic capabilities and expertise to help schools enable a variety of learning models, remote, hybrid, blended and in-person. Higher ed increased low single digits. Growth slowed versus prior quarters as customers assess their plans to invest stimulus funding to prepare for returning students. Healthcare declined 2%, a meaningful improvement to prior quarters. Customers were more optimistic due to increased income generated from the return to elective procedures and the accelerated vaccination pace. Solutions returned to growth driven by customers refreshing and updating their data centers. Other, which represents our U.K. and Canadian operations, increased over 20% on a reported basis. In local currency, the U.K. team increased net sales double digits, and the Canada team drove high single-digit growth. Strong results for both markets were driven by fiscal year-end government spending as well as continued investment by health care and education customers. Our first quarter performance benefited from the diversity of our customer base and from our deep and broad product portfolio. We continued to meet the critical demands of our customers. Transactions increased strong double digits and solutions returned to growth, increasing low single digits. Hardware was up strong double digits, driven by excellent notebook growth across all channels, leading to 26% client device growth. Software declined high single digits due to a decline in software licenses, but software gross profit growth remains solid. While services decreased low single digits when adjusted for overlapping the contribution from the Census project last year, services grew strong double digits, driven by strength in our professional and managed services. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and a key enabler of our value proposition. We also delivered excellent growth in our cloud practice. Cloud customer spend increased strong double digits across all customer end markets, driven by robust growth in Infrastructure as a Service, security, productivity and collaboration. We expect strong customer demand for cloud solutions to continue, and we are well positioned to deliver. Our first quarter operating and financial performance reflects the combined impact of our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our full suite of solutions and services across the IT landscape and our ongoing success executing our 3-part strategy for growth. They are important drivers of our past and future performance. The diversity of our customer end markets serves us well when macro or other external challenges impact various industries and customers differently. Our extensive product, services and solutions portfolio positions us to meet our customers' total needs across the spectrum of IT. The balance of our customer end markets and our offerings are especially relevant in the current environment. And the final driver of our performance is our 3-part strategy for growth, which is to, first, acquire new customers and capture share; second, enhance our solutions capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Let me share 2 examples of our strategy in action and how we help customers last quarter. Our Small Business team helped a customer that enables digital platforms to utilize natural language processing and machine learning to upgrade its technology infrastructure after it had been postponed due to COVID last spring. In early 2020, our account manager was working with the customer's technology team on a server upgrade at its primary data center. COVID hit and the customer froze all capital expenditures.  Our account manager did a great job nurturing the relationship so that CDW is well positioned to help our customer when the project resumed. Last quarter, the customer was more optimistic about its future prospects and ready to proceed. It got access to capital and wanted to take advantage of its employees still working remotely. The project scope was expanded to upgrade all infrastructure, security, networking, storage, servers and software at its headquarters and its primary data center. The customer relied heavily on our team for its expertise to design and implement the complex solutions. In 2020, customers had to react quickly to the impact of COVID. In 2021, we see that our customers are being strategic and proactively looking to technology to be more effective and efficient in a post-COVID world. As I shared earlier, we acquired Amplified IT at the end of the first quarter. We are excited about the opportunity to go to market together with our combined strengths and to orchestrate complete hardware, software, services and cloud solutions that leverage our full stack capabilities and drive full outcomes for and deep engagement with our education customers. We started to execute against this vision immediately. CDW's relationships and extensive contract vehicles with the State Department of Education enabled the customer frictionless access to Amplified IT's portfolio. The school system needed to enhance its communication and collaboration tools to service community in different learning formats, so it centralized and standardized its technology with the help of Amplified IT and CDW to provide the right tools and support to its teachers and students across approximately 250 schools. We are excited about the addition of Amplified IT and see significant opportunity ahead. These examples highlight CDW's 3-part strategy for growth and demonstrate our relentless focus on customer service, the importance of M&A to add solutions and services capabilities to best serve our customers and how we leverage our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace. I'm so proud of the way that our teams continue to deliver for our customers. Our distribution and configuration centers remain fully operational. We expect our office coworkers to continue to be remote until at least this fall, with plans underway by our ReunITe team to reimagine our future of work to continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else can. Let me now share our updated thoughts on 2021. We are increasing our outlook for both the U.S. IT market growth and CDW's net sales premium to market. We now expect the U.S. IT market growth to be about 4% and our top line to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency. For the second quarter, we are encouraged about customer demand to date and how our teams are executing. That said, we are cautious about the supply environment, which, as I mentioned, has become more challenged since the end of the first quarter.  While there are other wildcards such as new COVID variants, vaccine rollout, return to office and potential policy changes, including infrastructure and taxes, our confidence in the prospects of the business have never been higher. Technology will be more essential to all sectors of the economy and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. We have confidence that we have the right strategy to best serve our customers and partners, enhance our competitive position and deliver sustainable profitable growth. CDW's role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. We will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages to help our customers address their IT priorities and achieve their strategic objectives and out-execute our competition. Before I turn the call over to Collin for his comments on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition plans we announced earlier today. First, I want to thank Collin for his contributions to CDW over the past 13 years and his strong leadership as our CFO since 2018. Collin has played a significant role in our evolution and consistent market-leading growth as a public company, and he has established a truly best-in-class finance team. On a personal note, it's been wonderful to be a close colleague of Collin's over 13 years, and I've greatly appreciated his partnership. We are also appreciative of Collin's commitment to support CDW in the search for his successor and to remain on the Board to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn it over to Collin. Yes. One thing, Amit. And I'd say, look, as customers continue to work through their budgets and keep a close eye on the macro environment, the vaccine rollout, that's really going to dictate where they're spending and if we continue to see this uptick in hardware refresh. In terms of software, look, that can be fairly lumpy as we've talked about before. Depending on the mix of software, this quarter, we saw license -- shorter-term licenses and licenses not as strong, but I'll tell you, SaaS continues to be quite strong across the portfolio. So we don't expect software to start to diminish as we move forward in the year, notwithstanding a hardware refresh. It's still critically important, obviously, to the full stack. So I think we'll continue to see software strong. It's just going to bounce around depending on what's being bought and whether or not it's netted down. Thanks, Amit. Okay. Katy, it's Chris. I'll take that. I think I heard -- you cut out for a minute, but I think the question was on the IT market rate of growth given some of the forecasts out there. And as you know, we triangulate from a variety of sources. We do customer input partner inputs the CIO and VAR surveys and the IDCs and Gartners. And I'd share a couple of thoughts. I think the forecast tend to lag current market conditions for the third-party analysts. And while demand feels very healthy, I'm not sure how many of the external forecasts are incorporating the impact of supply chain that we've talked about. And the CIO surveys, if you focus on that, they are a little more cautious than some of the others. So we feel pretty confident that we've landed on a growth rate that feels right, right now. But of course, as we go through the year, as we always do, we'll update based on what we see the changes in the market. I would say it's overweighted to -- it's overweighted to hardware and clients, but it's really broadly driven. The demand is across both transactional and solutions, and that's driving the market rate of growth in our view. Yes. That's a great question, Shannon. It will be a tailwind in our mind for sure. I think about it a little bit like getting an elephant through the snake. It takes some time to actually get it moving through the system. So when you think about the 3 different stimulus acts that have been passed last March and then last December and then most recently in March, there are funds that have been available for state and local K-12 and Healthcare, in particular, where we see the most benefit for our customers. And we have a team actually that goes through the stimulus bills and understands where the dollars are going and frankly, help our customers quite a bit in understanding how and where and when they can spend their dollars. So we see it as an absolute tailwind and our customers do look to us to help understand how best to utilize those funds. If you look at the most recent of the American Rescue Plan in March, there's about $350 billion going to state and local and $130 billion going to K-12. So we certainly look forward to helping them use those and invest in technology as they come out of the current environment. So yes, if we take K-12 for example. We go to market with what we call customer-centric solutions. So we're focused on those areas that are most strategic and important to our customers. K-12, for example. Think of classroom transformation, think of school-facing, think of networking augmentation. So certainly, after the stack, starting with a consultative role in a design role and then bringing to bear our implementation, integration and management capabilities. But we -- K-12 really turns to CDW and state and local health care, who are going to be beneficiaries of the stimulus, for the holistic capabilities that we bring to bear. And at the end of the day, that actually helps them maximize the dollars they can use through stimulus because we know how to work those dollars through the needle. Well, our premium does tend to be 200 to 300 basis points higher than the market when we start the year. We hold ourselves accountable for that. And when we sell a lot of hardware, as you know, which is recognized at full revenue, we tend to outperform that premium. So we brought it up to 300 to 400 basis points. When you think about the mix of hardware, that seems to make a lot of sense to us. So if I just go through the math. If we take Census out of the baseline, which contribute about 2 -- 200 to 240 basis points to premium last year, we're looking at a good 500 to 600 basis points this year by bringing our premium up those 100 basis points. So when you ask about whether or not we, as I said, kind of durable forecast or outlook for outperformance, I would say it really depends on the mix. In years where we have high hardware, we tend to outperform because we recognize much of what we sell on a full net sales basis. In times when we have slower sales of hardware, and we have more netted down items, that's when we'll see the top line more muted. So we're hesitant to commit to a higher premium generally because of the mix of the business. And the beauty of the model is exactly that mix of the business. We've got the full range of IT products and we go where our customers need them when they need us. So I don't see us bringing that up to a higher level at any point soon, but rather toggling to where our customers need us. It's -- let me start with a step back. If you think across our customers, you hear quite a bit about when people are going back or returning to the office. And I'll tell you, while certainly there you see in the news a couple of large organizations that are returning to the office pretty quickly in the summer, most of our customers around -- across Commercial and Small Business are still, I'd say, not rushing. They're still planning and they're still a little cautious because they've got employees on both sides of the spectrum. Those who want to get back and those who frankly aren't yet ready to get back. So first, I would just say we're in a time right now where as the vaccination pace might accelerate and we see what happens over the next couple of years. We've got to be patient for a couple of months. All that said, clearly, the hybrid world is here to stay and our customers are thinking and planning around how to have flexible -- where people are now calling Hyflex environment, hybrid and flexible environment.  And so we are in the -- we are still planning with them. We are seeing some customers that have had just old infrastructure and a real need to upgrade get to it over the past couple of months. But we are still heavily in the phase of, I'll call it, assessment to optimize, whether old plans to upgrade throughout the window and we start to move more to cloud, whether customers think more strongly about on-prem cloud-like solutions, which are now really readily available and of great interest. So what I would say, Matt, is that we're still -- customers are still assessing and they're being more reflective. As Collin mentioned, last year, there was just a kind of a rush to get business continuity. And now there's a more measured, reflective strategic approach on what's going to be durable competitive advantage for the long term. So what does that all mean? We have seen customers spending more on infrastructure, hardware infrastructure. Obviously, cloud is doing really quite well. We saw a server uptick. Storage is getting stronger. One would expect we'd see netcomm really come to life later in the year or midyear as customers are heading back to the office. But there's -- on-prem hardware is not going to go away, it's just what's going to be most optimal. And as I said, customers are really weighing the benefits right now. Thanks for the question. Let me start with the second part first. Our guidance isn't dependent on when or how many people we get back into the office or going on to customer sites. So we've really done a great job. The team has done a great job of staying connected and staying productive. So we're not -- it's not dependent on that. In terms of going back to the office and how we think about that, a couple of things. First of all, we have coworkers on both ends of the spectrum. As I mentioned before, as most companies do, we've got some who are really eager to be back and some who are still cautious until we get through the pandemic more fully. So what we've done is we've created opportunities for customer -- for coworkers to come together and have social and networking time in a safe way. We've also given guidance to our coworkers who are customer-facing around getting together with customers who would like to get together again in a safe way, and that started to happen. We also have customers who are very comfortable with our service provision in a remote way, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic. But we also have customers who are now opening up and allowing us back on site. We have bases that are opening, et cetera. So I guess I'd say, look, we're doing very well from a productivity and connectivity perspective. We are starting to get together with customers in-person. And you can imagine it depends on what's happening within each state, for example, or each country. I think the U.K. just had their garden pubs open, and that was a big event and customers do want to get together. But we're going to do this right. We don't really want to do this with fits and starts. That's really the key for us. We want to be able to have our coworkers come back together in a way that is -- continues our highly engaged and high-performing culture and keeps the customer at the center of how we actually work together so we can continue to serve our customers and partners better than anyone else. I would say if you were to take a scale of 1 to 100, how many are actually back in work, we're still very much on the lower end of the spectrum. So we still have a very large number of customers who are continuing to work remotely. For those who are going -- have some folks going back into the office. What we're observing is a continued investment in mobile employees, the ability to be in the office on a flexible basis, the ability to move around the office and use the office in a different way. Now the question is, what work are you doing in the office? And do you need to have more -- even more collaboration spaces and the ability for your employees to have mobile devices that they can move around with and take home? So I would say our view is that the flexible hybrid work environment is what the preponderance of our customers expect to be in over the long term. And that includes notebooks, a higher density end of notebooks, obviously, more enterprise-level collaboration capabilities.  We do have some customers who are contemplating whether to have a desktop in the office and a notebook at home for coworkers, it really depends on the industry. Things like lockers and hoteling are really points of discussion now. But that's what we're seeing overall, if that's helpful. Yes. I guess if I think about K-12 education, I'll start with K-12, there are a couple of things. Device demand continues to remain strong because there is such a gap to that one-on-one device ratio that schools are trying to get to for equity and access and also for something they're referring to as learning loss, these gaps that might have happened over the pandemic. So there's plenty of headroom for devices going forward. With regard to CDW, what we face are tough compares from last year. So if you think about our growth over last year, very tough compares, but the demand is strong.  The other thing I would say is, as we're going into the next school year, schools are figuring -- and we're working with schools to figure out how to create the most optimal classroom experience, and that would be a blended experience, hybrid experience, all in-class. Schools really have -- they're looking at the ways of learning that they can use technology within a classroom or outside the classroom but within the walls of the school in much more creative ways. So from an infrastructure, I call it networking and particular perspective, we would expect to see upticks there. And then think of audio and visual. The older interactive flat screen panels are getting old now, but there are newer availabilities of solutions that work better. So that's another opportunity to help really modernize the classroom. So net-net, demand will remain strong with regard to devices, but the opportunity for infrastructure, network augmentation and for video will be a good opportunity as well. Yes. Sure, Matt. Let me -- we'll talk a little bit about maybe tailwinds and headwinds. So when we think about tailwinds, certainly, the need for more remote devices, and we've talked a lot about that today, whether it's remote-enabled work or learning and device density. Then there are new use cases. We've seen a great uptick in Catalyst, for example, in terms of how our customers engage with their customers in new ways. So you've got demand from there. You've got leverage -- get the ability to leverage the stimulus. We've got those dollars flowing through. And then we also have our Corporate and Small Business segments that are recovering nicely, and the comparables over last year are pretty low. So we've got some positives in there. Then you mentioned the refresh, absolutely, 2017 and '18, we have seen and would expect to continue to see that refresh go on. So we are selling into that. On the headwind side, look, we had big overlaps over 2020 in some of our segments including K-12. And the economy is still a wildcard, though employment looks like it's picking up, and that's been quite helpful, frankly, in the Small Business space with regard to endpoint solutions. And then the last thing I would just emphasize is the headwinds and the challenges that we're facing. There's real lot visibility there. But otherwise, the demand for client devices continued to be strong. Yes. We absolutely are going to continue to invest in our business, whether it's coworkers, other acquisitions or digital transformation, as Collin mentioned. So we certainly will continue to invest in our coworkers. Thank you. And thank you to everyone on the call today. I would like to really recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and they're extraordinarily committed approach to serving our customers, our partners and all of our CDW stakeholders. Our coworkers bring it every single day. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you. To our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest and support of CDW, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Collin Kebo",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My 13 years at CDW have been among the most rewarding of my career, and I want to thank you, the leadership team and all coworkers for making CDW so special. I also want to thank the finance team for bringing it every day. I'll miss CDW, but I'm confident the company has never been stronger and its best days are ahead. Following a successful transition, I'm looking forward to retiring so I can spend more time with family and helping others. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2021 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $4.8 billion, up 10.2% on a reported basis and 12% on an average daily sales basis as we had 1 fewer selling day. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 10.9%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales decreased 3.9% versus the fourth quarter. First quarter sales were stronger than expected, reflecting several factors. On the demand side, the timing and slope of the recovery was better than expected in several channels most impacted by COVID-19 last year. Small Business, CDW Canada and CDW U.K. all delivered strong growth and declines in Corporate and Healthcare improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter. On the supply side, our team did a great job navigating the challenging environment, leveraging our distribution capabilities and strong vendor partner relationships and was able to work down a portion of the backlog in Chromebooks, which was higher than normal coming into the year. This supply, coupled with continued strong demand from education customers, resulted in education net sales doubling compared to the prior year. Gross profit for the quarter was $795 million, an increase of 5.1% on a reported basis and 6.8% on an average daily sales basis. Gross margin was 16.4%, down 80 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by lower product margin, including notebook mix and rate and overlapping higher-margin configuration services for the Census project last year, partially offset by an increase in the mix of netted down revenues, primarily Software as a Service. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A decreased 5.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and entertainment expense. If you recall, last year, we increased our credit loss reserve as a result of the expected impact of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher investments in coworkers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 10,186. Coworker count increased 204 from the fourth quarter, driven by an increase of approximately 120 customer-facing coworkers, including over 40 from Amplified IT. The increase in coworker count reflects investments to support high-growth solution areas and the digital transformation of our own business. Year-over-year coworker count increased to 82, driven by organic and inorganic investments in coworkers to support high-growth solution areas and our digital transformation, partially offset by cost management actions in 2020. GAAP operating income was $323 million, up 31.6%. Non-GAAP operating income, which better reflects operating performance, was $368 million, up 21%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.6%, a record high margin for our first quarter, reflecting the benefit of our variable cost structure. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $36 million, down 6.1%. The decrease was primarily due to a lower LIBOR rate and savings from last year's refinancing, partially offset by notes issued in April of 2020. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 19.5%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $56 million compared to $44 million last year. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, down 70 basis points versus last year's rate, primarily due to lower global intangible low-taxed income and lower nondeductible expenses. As you can see on Slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 143 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.63, up 40.3%. Our non-GAAP net income was $249 million in the quarter, up 24.7%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $1.74, up 26.2% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $879 million and net debt was $3.1 billion. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $101 million, as shown on Slide 15. This was lighter than a typical first quarter, but expected given last year's record $1.2 billion of free cash flow, which benefited from timing and onetime items. In Q1, we saw some of the timing reverse as we mixed out of vendors with extended payment terms and made payments related to the Census. For the quarter, we deployed cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities, purchasing Amplified IT and returning $415 million to shareholders, including $56 million of dividends and $358 million of share repurchases at an average price of approximately $148 per share. Moving to Slide 16. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 22 days, up 2 days from last year's first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a 2-day increase in DIO as we made investments in inventory to support customers through the choppy supply environment. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 17. Our priorities remain the same. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. To guide these increases, we will target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings going forward. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place, with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the first quarter at 2x, up 0.3 of a turn from year-end. Third, supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of Amplified IT that Chris highlighted is a great example of this. We remain active in evaluating M&A targets. And fourth, return excess cash after dividends and M&A to shareholders through share repurchases. Going forward, we expect to continue to move closer to our target net leverage range of 2.5 to 3x through a combination of organic investments, M&A and cash return to shareholders. We continue to expect to return at least $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021, including approximately $1 billion for share repurchases with the balance from dividends. Of course, as we always do, we'll closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, liquidity, M&A activity, leverage and adjust as needed. Moving to the outlook for 2021 on Slide 18. The current environment continues to be challenging to forecast with a high degree of confidence. On the demand side, we are encouraged by the activity and building momentum, particularly with U.S. commercial customers, where April writings for corporate and small business were up healthy double digits on a year-over-year basis. We're also seeing good activity at CDW Canada and CDW U.K. On the supply side, uncertainty has increased since the first quarter. Our backlog is higher than normal and increasing with lead times extending and visibility challenged at suppliers. Notebooks, certain Chromebooks, displays and pockets of infrastructure hardware are becoming more constrained. Net demand, particularly with commercial customers, feels stronger than 3 months ago, but supply is more challenged. With that context, our updated outlook is for the U.S. IT market to grow approximately 4%. We expect CDW net sales to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market in constant currency, including the contribution from Amplified IT.  Currency is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 60 basis points for the full year, assuming exchange rates of $1.36 to the British pound and $0.79 to the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid-7% range for 2021. We now expect non-GAAP constant currency earnings per share growth in the low double digits, call it, 11% to 11.5%. Currency is expected to contribute an additional approximately 50 basis points to earnings per share growth. This updated full year outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.30 over last quarter. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate are unchanged from last quarter and can be found on Page 19. Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. On the February earnings call, we did not provide a first half, second half sales split as we typically would because of the uncertainty. Based on our current assessment, we expect the split to be approximately 48.5% to 49% first half, 51.5% to 51% second half. This assumes a slight sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis and equates to low double-digit year-over-year growth in the second quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth. If supply turns out to be more resilient, enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand, that would be upside to the outlook. We feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the next 3 quarters and potentially into 2022. Additional modeling thoughts on the components of cash flow can be found on Slide 20. Our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb remains unchanged at 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales, assuming current tax rates. Given the timing impacts that contributed to 2020 significant over delivery, we continue to expect 2021 free cash flow to be at or slightly below the low end of the range. We continue to expect CapEx to run approximately 75 to 80 basis points as a percent of net sales, slightly higher than the historical 50 basis points rule of thumb. As we mentioned before, we believe now is the time to accelerate investment in digital transformation in our own business, enabling us to fortify our competitive position and make CDW the trusted partner of choice for customers and vendor partners. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls. That concludes the financial summary. With that, I'll ask Cristal to open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, Amit. On both the year-over-year and sequential basis, there's some recurring things. I would say the biggest driver is product margin particularly driven by notebook, mix and rate. Obviously, we've had strong growth in Chromebooks in education. The other thing that happened in the quarter was really strong growth in our U.K. and Canadian businesses. It was a fiscal year-end for many of their public customers. We had a very strong fiscal year end in those markets, and a lot of those deals tended to be in client devices. So you have public and client device end market mix internationally. In the previous quarter, Q4 benefited from strong configuration services as we decommissioned the majority of the devices we had from the Census Device as a Service offering last year. A little of that spilled over into the first quarter, but for the most part, it was done. As you think about gross margin, as you know, we don't provide an outlook. It can bounce around from quarter-to-quarter based on a variety of factors. We do tend to focus on the NGLI margin because of our variable cost structure, and that's more variable. But if I can just share some thoughts on some of the puts and takes to gross margin as you think about the next couple of quarters. I think from a tailwind perspective, I would expect the longer-term secular trend to 100% gross margin items and as well as us continuing to grow our higher-margin services businesses. In terms of headwinds, we've talked about this for some time, but there's hardware mix, and particularly within the hardware mix, client devices and Chromebooks. And then from a product margin perspective, I think some things to think about, there's that continuous commoditization that you can see. I think we went through a unique period over the past couple of quarters where we saw customers prioritizing speed and execution over price. We're beginning to move into what I would describe as a more normalized customer behavior environment where customers are willing to wait a little bit longer and prioritize price over speed because the urgency and kind of existential threat of the pandemic in business continuity isn't as great as it was just a few quarters ago. From an OEM perspective, obviously, there's some supply challenges out there and OEMs aren't getting as aggressive on special pricing programs as they might with a channel with more normalized environment. So I think you have a lot of things going on there.  We have been through cycles like this before. I'd point to the 2018 to 2019 time frame, where our top line ticks up into the high single digits or even low double digits as we sell a lot of hardware, we exceed our 200 to 300 basis point premium by a meaningful amount, but gross margin has a '16 handle on it. And I think that's part of the power of the business model is that we pivot to where the profitable growth is, and that's why we do focus on non-GAAP operating income and EPS and free cash flow. Yes, Katy. What I would say is we came into the year with a higher-than-normal backlog. And while there were some ups and downs as we went through the quarter and some ups and downs by end market, by the time we ended the first quarter, the backlog was relatively consistent with where it was at the beginning of the year. So that would tell you that writings in sales and sales generally kept pace with each other. Where we've seen the backlog increase has been more subsequent to the end of the first quarter, and that would tell us that we're writing well ahead of shipments. Thank you. Yes, Adam. I mean, we -- first, thank you. You're right. This is one of the parts of the job that I won't miss down the road. But putting all the mix issues aside, we are seeing some product margin compression in certain categories. And just to go a little bit deeper on some of the comments I've made before. Again, I just -- I think 2020 was really unique in the way that customers were prioritizing speed and execution overtaking every last basis point off the table in terms of their IT buying behavior. And I think now that we're moving into a different phase of the pandemic where that mission-critical nature of getting that IT purchase as quickly as possible just isn't there, we're seeing a return to kind of some of that more normal customer buying behavior. I would characterize the competitive environment as competitive, not irrational, but we compete in a highly competitive marketplace. From an OEM perspective, they are obviously wrestling with higher input costs and supply challenges, right? And so because of that -- that drives a couple of things. One, they are not incentivized to aggressively invest as much in the channel and special pricing programs and things like that, that they might in a more normal supply environment and a more normal competitive environment where they're battling it out to gain share. And in some instances, they're taking those higher costs and passing them along in the form of price increases. Now we do work on a cost-plus model, as we've talked about over the years. But if you just think about the math of the way a price increase works, if, for argument's sake, we make $100 per unit of gross profit on a notebook. And that notebook price goes up by 5% or 10%, that is going to be a lower reported gross margin percentage. So I think those are some of the dynamics that are driving some of the changes we're seeing on product margin currently versus some of the preceding quarters. Yes, I would say abnormal education seasonality is the single biggest driver here. If you look historically what has driven the increase in sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, education is, by far, the number one factor when you look across our end markets. So we just come into the typical education peak season with a much stronger base. And we've talked about several quarters now of unusual or abnormal education seasonality. So I would say that's the first driver. I touched on a couple of other ones in my prepared comments. But again, just an unusually strong public year-end finish in the U.K. and Canada. I know it's public year-end every year in the first quarter, but we just had a particularly strong finish this year. And then we also carried a little bit of Census revenue in the first quarter as we completed the device to decommissioning. We are completely done with that and have no Census revenue going forward. I think the other thing that I would think about, and I made this comment in one of the answers earlier, was that our backlog was relatively unchanged over the course of the first quarter. If supply is more resilient than we think -- actually, I don't think it is. But if supply is more resilient and we can begin whittling down that backlog or if demand is even greater, and supply can keep up with that greater demand, I think that could provide some upside in terms of sequential growth and into the back half of the year. We just don't have the visibility at this point, though, to build that confidence on supply into the full year outlook and into the second quarter. Thanks, Ruplu. In terms of our own CapEx, again, we talked about this a little bit on the call. But a lot of that is going into our own digital transformation, and that can be better tools for our sellers, more AI, how our customers interact with CDW and making those transactions more frictionless as well as investments we're making in supply chain, both resiliency as well as flexibility. So I would think about CapEx going across those buckets. In terms of adding another distribution center, I don't know that in the next few years, we would have a -- build another 0.5 million square foot distribution center. I think we would look at more dynamic and flexible models, working with third-party logistics organizations and really thinking through how to optimize our footprint across the U.S. from a supply chain perspective. Oh, and I think you had a question on utilization. Yes. Look, the distribution centers are busy. There's no doubt about that. Part of that is us flexing our muscles and where we can, bringing inventory in and configuring that and staging it for our customers and helping them through this choppy environment. So there is some capacity there. It's tight. And again, I think we would use more of a flexible model and more of a renting space in the short term as we need it until we get a better sense of what supply and demand look like over the longer term. No, Keith, I wouldn't think pricing power per se. I think the competitive advantage is probably more on the ability to secure supply to the tenants available and getting at least our fair share. I think ultimately, your ability to price through it is a function of the competitive environment and the customer's willingness to wait. And I think that's what's different now versus, say, 2, 3 quarters ago, where the customer wasn't willing or couldn't wait. So I don't know that there's a huge opportunity to pass along incremental pricing beyond what the market will bear is what I would say. I would say it's both. The components -- I mean, obviously, the processor shortage is well documented, but things like glass and -- it just -- all of the challenges associated with that. And then, again, the logistics challenges of ports and canals and natural disasters and all of those things. So it is really a confluence of events that are impacting supply."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2023. Then I'll hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our fourth quarter was an excellent example of the power of our business model when coupled with our broad and deep portfolio of technology solutions. In an extraordinary period of shifting customer priorities, we delivered record profitability. For the quarter, net sales were $5.4 billion, $100 million below 2021, and roughly flat on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP operating income was $523 million, 23% above last year; and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.50, up 21% year-over-year, up 22% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by the team's ability to pivot to meet customer priorities and capture high relevance, high growth opportunities. This led to excellent performance across services, cloud, security, and software. Performance that drove record profitability and exceptional outcome given market dynamics and an outcome that is a direct result of the investments we have made in solutions and services over the past several years. Simply put our ability to deliver outcomes across the full stack and full lifecycle of technology drove strong profit growth notwithstanding a meaningful decline in client devices. This quarter clearly demonstrates the power of our strategy when combined with the resiliency of our business model. So what happened to client devices this quarter? While we expected some level of contraction in client devices and accessories given the past two years of heavy investment, the magnitude of the decline in the fourth quarter was certainly steeper than anticipated. The primary driver was the K-12 market, which represented roughly half of the client device decline. We also saw a general moderation in client device demand across channels as economic uncertainty increased. As we always do, we stayed the course on our playbook and maintained our discipline with a focus on our customer and our value proposition. This discipline contributed to this quarter's excellent cash flows and strong economic returns. In Q4, the combination of lower transactional business and the team's success delivering on customer demand for solutions and services led to a meaningful shift in our sales mix. Let me put this in perspective for you. You've heard us speak over time about the impact of solutions mix and notably netted-down revenue streams on our financial results. As we have grown our netted-down revenue streams over time, total annual customer spend has consistently grown a few hundred basis points faster than net sales. In periods where we mix into more solutions business that nets down and mix out of client device business that fully shows up in net sales that growth rate spread will be wider. In Q4 an extreme mix shift took place. The result was meaningful customer spend growth significantly dampened net sales growth and very healthy gross margins that drove delivery of gross profit. Now let's turn briefly to the full-year results. 2022 was a year of financial performance underpinned by progress on our three-part strategy for growth. The first pillar of our strategy is to capture share and acquire new customers. One way we do this is through strategic acquisitions. The addition of Sirius is a great example of this. Sirius elevated and expanded our services capabilities providing an excellent cross-sell opportunity into our existing customer base. At the same time, Sirius customers represent excellent cross-sell opportunity given the broader CDW portfolio. The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions areas. Strategic coworker investments contributed to excellent solutions performance through 2022, with strong growth in cloud, security and network upgrades. The third pillar of our strategy is to expand services capabilities. As a key enabler of our value proposition, services are fundamental to our full stack, full lifecycle, full outcomes go-to-market approach. Services engagement solves critical customer problems and drive enduring customer relationships. In 2022, the team delivered more than 20% services growth across the business. No doubt, our acquisitions have accelerated our services breadth and depth and have been foundational to our success. 2022 was indeed a year of strategic performance across all three of our priorities. It was also a year of exceptional financial performance. The team delivered record results with constant currency net sales growth of 15% and each profit category down the P&L statement up 20% or more. Results enabled by ongoing investment in our three-part growth strategy, investments that have made us a vital technology partner, whether customers' priorities require transactional or highly complex solutions. You see the impact of these investments on our fourth quarter performance as the team pivoted to meet customer shifting priorities and advise, design and orchestrate full outcomes. Outcomes that deliver five key organizational benefits: innovation, lower cost, agility, risk mitigation, and enhanced experiences for customers and coworkers. Let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter. There were three main drivers of our fourth quarter results: our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio, and relentless execution of our three-part strategy. First, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion over the last 12 months. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of US$2.9 billion. Our corporate team delivered another strong quarter with a 7% sales increase. The team helps customers accelerate implementation of priorities to automate tasks, detect fraud and enhance customer and employee experiences. This drove excellent cloud software and security results. Our ability to address priorities focused on application and network modernization and consumption-based data center solutions led to excellent services and net comp performance, each up double-digits. Economic uncertainty led customers to de-prioritize endpoint solutions, which resulted in a decline in client devices. Small business declined 13%. The team pivoted to help customers address priorities to maximize prior IT investments and identify savings opportunities to fund new and ongoing projects. At the same time, the team helped customers address mission-critical priorities around security and take advantage of the benefits of cloud, both with heightened urgency. Strong growth from security and cloud were balanced against the decline in client devices as customers put upgrades on hold awaiting greater clarity around the economy and employment plans. Strong results across healthcare and government cannot offset the decline in education driven by K-12 client device dynamics and public sales decreased 9% year-over-year. The healthcare team delivered another excellent quarter of robust growth, up 8%. Talent needs and data center projects remain key focus areas as customers increasingly thought technology solutions to address complex industry challenges. This drove excellent performance in NetComm, servers and services. Mission-critical investments to enhance patient care and experience continued with telehealth and telesitting driving excellent collaboration performance. Government grew double-digits, up 13.5%. Strong state and local sales growth continued, driven by customer adoption of IT strategies for hybrid cloud, as well as network modernization and Zero Trust security frameworks. Services increased more than 50%, as the team helps state and local municipalities address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagements. Federal also continued to grow in the fourth quarter. The team's ability to help agencies achieve their priorities around data management drove excellent server and storage performance.  For education, higher ed high single-digit sales growth was more than offset by declines in K-12 and overall sales decreased. Higher ed continued their success helping implement student success programs, which institutions use to promote enrollment. Our ability to help drive program elements that include improved security, campus connectivity as well as enhanced storm room experiences drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, server, storage, software and security. For K-12, we expected a continuation of third quarter performance where sales were down low-double-digits but instead experienced a more significant decline with client device units down more than 68%. As we shared last quarter, K-12 customers continued to focus on digesting the past several years' investments and evaluating multi-year funding opportunities to ensure they are making the best decisions for the future. This quarter, as many schools achieved one-to-one student client device ratios, there was a significantly heightened focus on reevaluating plans, and demonstrating need for ECF awards. When the device per student ratio was below 1:1 demonstrating need was straightforward. Today, with device per student at or above the 1:1 ratio, demonstrating need is more complex. For example, articulating why new devices with higher processor capability are required to run more complex applications or provide greater security is just a more complicated discussion and takes more time and approval. This heightened focus led some customers to defer or retract awarded funding commitments in order to assess, reevaluate and potentially reapply under the third and final wave of ECF, which is scheduled to end December 31, 2023. For CDW, this equated to several hundred million dollars of CDW awarded funding commitments being pulled back. I should note that even with these dynamic variables in the K-12 client devices arena, the team successfully executed on infrastructure opportunities across services, NetComm and servers, leading to strong gross profit delivery. And just as we've been doing in past cycles with K-12, the team will be there for our customers to help them work through the challenges to achieve their mission-critical outcomes and efficiently utilize available funding mechanisms. Other, our combined UK and Canada results reflected broad-based and balanced performance in both regions in local currency. UK increased low-double-digits in local currency and Canada increased high-single-digits in local currency. These results continue to demonstrate the grit and resilience of our teams and the power of our investments to drive growth in these markets. As you can see, our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and a driver of our differentiated performance. The second driver of our performance was the broad and deep portfolio. Our ability to address priorities across the entire IT continuum delivered high-single-digit growth across our solutions portfolio. U.S. hardware sales declined mid-teens. Within hardware, network modernization upgrades drove double-digit increases in NetComm. These excellent results were not enough to offset the decline in client devices and wraparound accessories. Supply conditions continued to improve across core transactional areas, while supply and solutions categories remained tight. Once again, we exited the quarter with an elevated backlog and extended lead times and solutions and notably in NetComm. We continue to expect this backlog to feather out over time. U.S. software sales increased 8%. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment with strong double-digit increases in operating systems, application suites and data management. Cloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to profitability. Once again, gross profit increased by double-digits. Compute database, storage, mobility and connectivity were key cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase. Our teams delivered excellent results as they continue to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement identity and access management solutions and provide training to our customers to help manage cloud deployments and enhance endpoint and application security. Services results were stellar again this quarter, up more than 20% with balanced performance across professional and managed services. Services are integral to today's complex technology solutions. Customers continue to lean into CDW as an extension of their own teams and leverage CDW services as part of their strategy. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our three-part growth strategy. Clearly, investments in our customer-centric growth strategy contributed to our strong profitability this quarter. Investments in services and solutions have elevated our relevance to customers for the highest level it has ever been. Our rigorous strategic process that is designed to ensure we can serve customers across the full stack, full lifecycle has made us a vital technology partner, whether customers' priorities require transactional or highly complex solutions. And that leads us to our 2023 outlook. Our baseline view of the U.S. IT market in 2023 is for flattish growth, factoring in both expected mix and the level of overall economic uncertainty. Consistent with economic forecast, this outlook assumes stronger growth in the second half relative to the first half. We continue to target CDW market outperformance of between 200 basis points and 300 basis points. Our current view of the market recognizes we are operating under greater uncertainty as it incorporates the potential impact of some of our recent wildcards and indeed, most notably the economy. With thousands of sellers connecting with customers every day, we have a real-time pulse of the market. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Our fourth quarter results highlight that although we cannot definitively know where our customers will place their priorities; there are two things we know for sure. Technology will continue to be a critical driver of outcomes. And with our agility and broadened deep portfolio, we will be there to support our customers wherever their priorities now live. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\nAl Miralles: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the fourth quarter and full-year, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.4 billion, down 1.8% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales declined 0.4%. Net sales were impacted by the significant change in client device demand during the quarter. With the decline in transactional products, there was a meaningful mix shift to solutions and services. Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of mixing into solutions and services on our results. Certain solutions such as Software-as-a-Service, software assurance and warranty solutions as well as aging commission fees generate meaningful customer spend but are recorded on a netted-down basis. Since we are not the primary obligor on these solutions, we record gross profit as our revenue. That is why you sometimes hear us refer to these netted-down revenues as 100% gross margin items. You certainly see the impact of this in both our net sales and our gross margin performance this quarter. As we continue to execute on our growth strategy and scale our solutions and services, we expect to continue to grow our netted-down revenue streams. All else equal, this mix dynamic will pressure net sales while remaining neutral to gross profit dollars and expanding gross margins. While much of what I've described is tied into the accounting treatment, it is also reflection of our success in the execution of our three-part strategy to capture share, enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions and expand services. The impact of this strategy was on full display this quarter as we experienced a significant mix shift out of client devices and into netted-down revenues, reflective of our customers' priorities. Returning to the P&L. Sequentially, net sales decreased 12.5% versus the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales historically decreased versus the third quarter but this quarter was exacerbated by the decline in demand for client devices. To dimensionalize the shortfall in net sales relative to our expectations, two-thirds of lower net sales were related to the public sector and driven primarily by K-12. In aggregate, solution categories delivered results above our expectations. Notwithstanding the noted mix shift of customer priorities, with respect to customer behavior, we did see increased scrutiny and deeper evaluation of projects and extra signatures increasingly required. In this environment, our sellers are staying close to their customers and working with their technical coworkers to help customers maximize return on investments. While we've not seen meaningful customer cancellations, we have seen some postponements and re-architecting on more complex hybrid cloud solutions as customers balance cost and utility. On the supply side, we saw similar conditions as in the third quarter with some improvement across categories but pockets of pressure remaining, especially in the solutions space. Our solutions backlog remains elevated versus historic levels and lead times are still extended. We expect our backlog to feather out over time as supply conditions ease, although not likely symmetrical across product categories. We continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers through this still uncertain supply environment. And just like our customers in this environment, our team is diligently managing working capital as we seek to enable profitable growth while ensuring strong economic returns. Our coworkers delivered excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 21.1%, lapping for the first time a one-month serious contribution in the fourth quarter of 2021. Gross profit margin was a record 21.7%, up 410 basis points versus last year and 190 basis points above our prior year quarter record. The year-over-year expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, product margins benefited from both mix into complex hybrid cloud solutions and lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, as we expected for the fourth quarter, a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. The category outpaced overall net sales growing 26% in Q4 2022 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Software-as-a-Service. And third, net sales contribution from high-margin services, which increased 28% in Q4 2022 compared to the prior year quarter with significant contribution from our recent acquisitions. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $658 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consistent with higher gross profit attainment and higher coworker count. SG&A declined by $26 million compared to the third quarter, reflecting the variable component of our compensation structure, which is principally tied to gross profit attainment. In this uncertain economic environment, we are also being mindful of our discretionary spending and our pace of our hiring. Our fourth quarter expense levels reflect both the benefits of our variable cost model and our prudent expense management. Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was nearly 15,100, up approximately 1,100 in the last year and essentially unchanged since the third quarter. Investments in our coworkers and in our strategy continue to be integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are focused on disciplined and balanced investments that drive value. This is evidenced by our record profitability in the period. GAAP operating income was $447 million, up 31.6% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $523 million, up 23.2%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 9.6%, up 190 basis points from the prior year and 80 basis points compared to the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, this improvement was driven by a confluence of favorable factors within gross margin. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $59 million. Higher interest expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius. This level of interest expense was in line with our expectation for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 24.7%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $94 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, 30 basis points below our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5% due to lower state taxes as well as non-deductible items. As you can see on Slide 13, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.09. Our non-GAAP net income was $343 million in the quarter, up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.50, up 21%. Turning to full-year results on Slide 14 through 19. As Chris mentioned, 2022 performance reflected exceptional execution, relentless focus and a strategy that is working. Net sales were $23.7 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, full-year consolidated net sales grew 15.2%. On a combined constant currency basis, we estimate full-year sales increased 5%, below our prior expectation of 8.25% due to the moderation in IT market growth as well as a contraction in our premium in the fourth quarter. Gross profit was $4.7 billion, up 31.3% and grew 19.7%, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. In 2022, software and services accounted for more than 40% of the total gross profit. Organic and inorganic investments in our services and solutions capabilities and a continued shift in the netted-down revenues are driving growth. Operating income was $1.7 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $2.1 billion, up 24.6%. Net income was $1.1 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $1.3 billion, up 19.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $9.79, up 22.9%. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $315 million and net debt was $5.6 billion. During the quarter, we reduced borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan by $200 million, consistent with our plan to reduce leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to Slide 21. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down three days from last year's fourth quarter, and within our range of high teens to low-20s, reflecting our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management, along with strong growth in the business also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $1.3 billion, as shown on Slide 22. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objective, including returning $80 million to shareholders through dividends in addition to $200 million in debt repayment, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 23. Our execution remains consistent with objectives we communicated last quarter. For 2023, we're updating those objectives as follows: first, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. This increase demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business. Going forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the fourth quarter at 2.6x net leverage, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash flow generation. As we expected and communicated during the third quarter call, 2.6x had us near the lower end of our 2022 targeted net leverage of 2.5x to 3x. For 2023 and beyond, our targeted net leverage ratio will be 2x to 3x, a range that is consistent with our commitment to an investment-grade capital structure and provides us with flexibility to proactively manage liquidity over time. Finally, we have successfully satisfied the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. As such, we are pleased to have reestablished our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A, and share repurchases, respectively in 2023. For 2023, we will target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. This is supported by the Board's authorization for a $750 million increase in the company's share repurchase programs. Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 24. While we are cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to execute, pivoted growth opportunities and outperform the broader market. While the overall IT market growth rate sentiment has been mixed, in the near-term, we continue to expect netted-down revenues will grow faster than other product and solution categories. With this in mind, we expect the IT market to be approximately flattish, reflecting our expectation of mix and the level of economic uncertainty. We maintain our long-held expectation to outgrow the market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points per year. Currency is expected to be neutral for the full-year, with modest headwinds in the first half and modest tailwinds in the second half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.24 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar in the first quarter. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid to high 8% range. We expect full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be at the upper end of a mid-single-digit range in constant currency. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter related to average daily sales, we expect low-single-digit sequential growth from Q4 to Q1. This equates to a mid-single-digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline for the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued strong gross profit margin and NGOI margin in the first quarter above the full-year 2022 levels for both but reflecting some moderation from what we experienced in Q4. And we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low-single-digits year-over-year. Finally, in line with the reevaluation of our capital priorities, we're adjusting our long-term rule of thumb for full-year free cash flow. In 2023, we expect full-year free cash flow to be within a range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales, up from our prior range of 3.75% to 4.25%. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter and across years. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now start today's Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I was hoping to ask just questions regarding your take on the client device environment. Not a big surprise that it was down significantly, particularly in K-12. But could you talk about the commercial side of the business? It sounds like some customers are being more cautious on upgrades. What's your thought on the PC cycle on the commercial side of the business and how you see that playing out this year?\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Matt. Yes. It's a good question. We have seen customers elongate the replacement cycle given the uncertain times. I mean you're seeing what we're seeing with hiring freezes and layoffs and things like that. So right now, there's just more pause than we had seen earlier in the year. Eventually, the benefit of enhanced productivity and security from the newer replacements will certainly drive a replacement cycle, but it's not happening right now with the level of uncertainty.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. And that's not contemplated then in your forecast for the year?\nChris Leahy: A rebound?\nMatt Sheerin: In terms of a -- yes, yes.\nChris Leahy: Yes. Our forecast contemplates the environment to feel pretty much like it feels now. That's what we've reflected in the forecast. I mean we do expect the PC market to remain larger than it was pre-pandemic. But right now, our forecast reflects the current environment and the current temperature.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. And then in line with that, are you also seeing pricing pressure or ASP declines as memory and other component prices come down? And is that also going to be reflected in your business?\nAl Miralles: Yes. Good morning, Matt. This is Al. We are not seeing -- I would say ASPs in the fourth quarter and ongoing continue to be really firm. And so that is not contemplated in our outlook.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Chris, from the prepared remarks, I mean it's clear that client devices are weak and likely will remain weak in the near-term. But if we think about it, if SMB is really a bellwether for the macro economy, are you concerned that demand for advanced solutions or data center devices like servers and storage that demand can also moderate? So what have you assumed for sustainability of that demand through 2023? And I think in the prepared remarks, you guided for kind of the seasonality in this year to be skewed more to the second half versus the first half. So what are you expecting to be stronger in the second half of 2023?\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Ruplu. Let me break that out. There are a couple of questions in there. Let me just start with the small business. And what I'd say on small business is the team is really executing well in a fairly cautious environment. And as I did mention, we are helping customers with priorities around infrastructure, networking, et cetera, primarily led by software and cloud. And of course, security is still top of mind. So what we're not seeing is a dampening in the small business of the need to modernize their infrastructure and maximize their prior investments. So we're seeing -- what I would say is continued steady demand from our small business customers for sure, with an emphasis again on cloud and security. In terms of the split, first half to second half of the year, I'm going to let Al address that in terms of the seasonality there. And then I think there was another question in there that you had, which was -- was there another question that you had?\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Or just the sustainability of demand for servers and storage and solutions throughout the year. I mean do you think that, that can be better in the second half? Or do you think it's a sense at this level throughout the year?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Here's what I'd say. I think as we've said for a while now, technology has become more vital to every walk of life into competitive advantage into success, et cetera. And we believe it's going to probably be more resilient to a challenging economic environment. Equally, given our business model and the strength of our portfolio, our ability to capture opportunity in a more difficult environment is pretty strong. But our expectation is for a level of resiliency in the technology space.\nAl Miralles: And good morning, Ruplu. On the -- on your question on seasonality, so first, just look, our outlook is based on the premise, we continue to see strength in software and services and lower growth in terms of hardware overall. With respect to the timing of that, first half, our typical seasonality would be first half 48, 49, we'd expect to maybe be slightly below that in the first half, and that's reflective of that continued slope towards more netted-down revenues and cloud, security, et cetera with the expectation that in the second half, you may see a pickup there, more on the client device. And so second half a bit stronger in terms of top-line impact, if you will.\nChris Leahy: Ruplu, it's Chris again. I would just add -- let me just add that as we think about the customer behavior more recently, and a lot of folks have been talking about extra signatures, a little more scrutiny, et cetera. Yes, we have been seeing that. We haven't been seeing is a pullback -- wholesale pullback in projects. In fact, those infrastructure projects that we had talked about being delayed a little bit are actually coming to the forefront. Again, back to the technology being essential to all of our customer base. So we are seeing that resiliency as well.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Got it. Thanks for the details there. Can I ask a follow-up? Al, I may have missed this, but on the call, did you mention what was netted-down items as a percent of gross profit in the fiscal 4Q? And sounded like that, that percent was unusually high in the quarter, and you expect that to moderate but your guide for next year for operating margin, I mean you're guiding it to be higher at mid to high-8% versus your original guide for this year was below 8%. So I guess my question to you would be what are you assuming for netted-down items as a percent of gross profit in 2023? And in general, can you help us parse out that year-on-year operating margin improvement? What are some of the factors that are driving the increase? And what are some of the headwinds year-on-year?\nAl Miralles: Sure. So let me just start with the operating margin. So operating margin, I would most notably point to expectation that we would continue to be somewhat higher on gross margin in 2023 versus 2022. I certainly would not expect that those gross margins would match what we saw in Q4, which was really extraordinary. But I would just start from that square that somewhat higher gross margins in 2023 will certainly drive our NGOI margin, coupled with expectation we'd have some operating leverage there. To your original question on netted-down revenues for the quarter, you're right. Our prepared remarks noted that netted-down revenues grew 26% year-over-year. On a percentage of GP basis, Ruplu, that was 31% in the fourth quarter, so continue to be really strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, in sort of the capital allocation priorities that you referenced in your prepared remarks, maybe we can sort of get a bit more color about how you're thinking about the M&A pipeline here? And sort of what are the focus areas, particularly as you look at sort of the changing mix of where customers are looking to spend? How are you thinking about the M&A pipeline and what are the focus areas for the company? And I have a follow-up, please.\nAl Miralles: Let me just start, and then Chris can add on from an M&A perspective. So as you know, our capital priorities reopened both M&A and share repurchase. And the way that I would think about that, as I spoke to that range of our free cash flow of 50% to 75%, we would expect return to shareholders. So if you take the dividend, you can get a sense for what that range would look like. There is a range there because we view that as really optionality for us to tackle between what's going to drive the longest strategic value, including M&A as well as what's going to maximize shareholder return in the more near-term. And so look, both of those options and array of options are available to us. We're certainly back on the path of share repurchases, but M&A is also on horizon as well.\nChris Leahy: Yes. And I would just add, we're never out of the market. We did have a pretty heavy year integrating Sirius, which is an incredibly successful and having an impact in the market. But we're always looking for organizations that can add capabilities in -- broadened capabilities, I should say, in high-growth, high relevance areas and also add scale to those practice areas that we've built if we can add scale at a faster pace, and we think about geography and our global presence. So we're always looking, and it's good to have a solid year of the Sirius integration behind us.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Got it. And for my follow-up, I know you're all talking about sort of client devices being softer than expected. But I think you also mentioned on the flip side, solutions tracked much better than expected which, again, sort of is counter to the mixed impressions we get about enterprise spending. So maybe if you can sort of give us a bit more color on -- is that really solutions doing better than expected more of a supply dynamic where supply is easing up faster? Or are you seeing sort of upsized deals from your customers? Or is it really a strong run rate of orders that you continue to see on that front continued interest from customers? Just trying to sort of parse that out in terms of the backdrop of -- the macro backdrop that we have.\nChris Leahy: Yes. No, it's a very fair question. And I would characterize it this way. We are seeing strong demand in the solutions space. And while we've had some supply feather out, I mean, where it's really moderated is on the client device space, some pockets in solutions but we're still carrying heavy backlog, particularly in NetComm. So the demand that you're seeing reflected in our performance is just that, it's demand, it's not a flow through of backlog.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, Chris, maybe to start with, you folks are talking about IT spend being flat in 2023. When I listen to IDC, Gartner, even some of your peers, they're all talking about IT spend being up about 3%, 4%. So from your perspective, where is the biggest delta here versus what you're talking about versus what maybe IDC Gartner and your peers are saying? And then how much of the delta do you think is perhaps conservatism and you can color where you're seeing that versus the netted-down revenue impact that you have?\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Amit. Well, look, I wish I could say that it felt stronger out there. I really do, but that's not what the temperature is that we're feeling. So we build our expectations by listening to our customers. We've got thousands of sellers and technical advisers out there. And it's just the pulse that's coming back to us and looking at industry and partner data, we're feeling that it's going to be flattish. And then the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of premium that we always commit to would be on top of that. In terms of mix, I guess what I would say is we don't calculate in our customer spend versus net sales as an example. But of course, in this kind of environment, as we've explained, when you've got hardware that's more muted and you've got, in our case, netted-down solutions more heavily in the mix, you can expect more meaningful customer spend than the net sales line reflects. But that said, we are right now feeling flattish. Of course, we'll update you as we move through the year, but that's kind of where we feel right now.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. It always seems that you folks start to guide gross profit dollars growing at a premium to IT spend versus revenues given the way the mix is going up. That may be a discussion for a different day. But I do want to ask you a follow-up on the NetComm market. You talked about December quarter; I think it was up in that business. I'd love to get a sense, as you see supply starting to improve, especially on the NetComm side, are you seeing cancellations or deferrals happening over there? And then how do you think about NetComm into 2023 in this flat IT spend environment?\nAl Miralles: Good morning, Amit. We are not seeing any level of cancellation or postponements there. The demand on NetComm, and you can see from our reported results, really, really strong. We're not getting a lot of help from a supply perspective, honestly. Extended lead times is still there. Our backlog has not moved substantially really -- our backlog has moved more in client, as Chris suggested, supply is still -- there's still friction there on the NetComm side, but that's notwithstanding really strong written demand.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Yes, Chris, maybe a high-level question for you. And that's now that you have a year of Sirius under your belt, and that being one of the larger acquisitions CDW has done in the last handful of years. How do you think about doing more transformational deals going forward rather than tuck-in deals? And then does kind of the lower leverage targets that you guys communicated today -- is that because you want greater flexibility to do larger deals? I just want to kind of get a sense of how you're thinking about transformational deals because it does seem like Sirius has been a pretty significant success for you and what your appetite would be for those types of deals going forward? And then I have a follow-up.\nChris Leahy: Yes. No, look, it's a great question, Erik, and it's all a matter of supply and demand, right? We're pretty particular in looking at organizations that really complement our suite of capabilities and/or scale them, along with the -- obviously, the financial return, but the fit in terms of culture. And I'll tell you, we've done eight over quarters and check, check, check. They've all been really outstanding. Now that said, there are companies out there that we think of and always reflecting on and some other larger transformational deal would certainly be something we'd consider. But it's a matter of finding them and making sure they're going to fit and provide the financial return. And you asked a question on the debt ratio, though, Al, did you want to tackle that?\nAl Miralles: Sure. So Erik, obviously, we're within our stated range, and I noted that our new leverage range is 2x to 3x. So certainly, we have room in that regard. And I would say as we think about M&A, certainly, smaller bolt-on as we've certainly done plenty of. We can do that with free cash flow and with our existing net leverage capacity. As we think about things bigger, obviously, we're going to look at what's the best use of our capital, which could include taking on more debt and could include other avenues. I will just note that while our goal is to stay within that investment-grade capital structure. Certainly, from the rating agencies, we get some room there that if you do larger M&A and you go beyond that, you have a grace period, if you will, and you have time that you then get back into that range. So all of that would be contemplated in our calculus as we think about deals.\nErik Woodring: Okay. Totally understand. And then, Chris, I'm not sure who wants to take this one. But generally, I think we've been hearing in the market kind of more weakness at the large enterprise level versus SMBs, your results would somewhat suggest the opposite with small business down versus the corporate business up. And so can you maybe just talk about some of the high-level trends you discussed in terms of extra signatures or deal downsizing, how that differs between the corporate business versus SMB business, if you are seeing any differences there? And again, same thing. I know we asked about pricing earlier on this call, but any difference in pricing between corporate versus SMB? And that's it for me. Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Okay. Erik, yes, so differences between enterprise and SMB in terms of the process. I would say that the -- look, larger enterprises have a muscle for this and we're dealing with that muscle, and we know how to deal with the muscle. The smaller business, frankly, turn to us for cost evaluation as a trusted partner. And so in some ways, we actually play this avid role with them, which is how do you figure out, where you make adjustments in your technology roadmap to achieve the cost effectiveness. So in terms of the behavior itself, I'd say small and medium-sized businesses are being cautious. Enterprises have kind of kicked in their muscle and they're doing the analysis that they do. But all of that said, we do continue to feel strong demand across all of our segments. Even K-12 that we've talked about, that was a real dynamic in the quarter. We're still very successful with them with network modernization, all the things that have to support the client devices. It's the demand. Demand is okay right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was wondering, can you talk a bit about working capital requirements as your model turns more and more to netted-down? I know this inventory levels came down quarter-over-quarter even with the shortfall in PCs and you've raised your target for free cash flow. So just how do you see your cash flow and balance sheet morphing over time? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Good morning, Shannon. So a few things. One, our -- we talked about our rule of thumb for free cash flow, and we raised that and I would say that's a reflection of our continued improvement and progress on really effectively managing working capital and also a somewhat of an effect or supported by the countercyclical nature of the business. So obviously, as this economic environment kind of moderates a bit, it actually helps from a cash flow perspective. So both of those things kind of in play. Your comment about netted-down or question about netted-down is a good one. It is a bit of a mathematical exercise. But just recall with our netted-down revenues, that while they show up in our net sales net, we're actually collecting gross dollars. So what that does from a cash conversion cycle perspective, it actually has the tendency to increase the DSO, increase DPO given the denominators and the numerator. So the way we think about that is really on a net basis. And can we continue to make progress within that band of high teens, low-20s on cash conversion. So all of those factors we consider as we're managing the business, including the puts and takes relative to our investments in inventory as well as how we manage AR and AP. So that's all part of really a dynamic operating model around working capital, and we're making really good progress on that front.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about demand you're seeing for Device-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service? It seems like in a challenged end market; maybe the ability to pay more ratably would be gaining some traction. But I'm just curious as what you're hearing maybe both from an enterprise standpoint as well as SMB. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes, Shannon, I'll take that. On the Infrastructure-as-a-Service, that is picking up. Our OEMs have been building that capability over time. And I'd say we've hit an inflection point where customers are eager to learn more and invest primarily enterprise, I would say, is a little stronger than the demand that we've seen in small business. On Device-as-a-Service that's a little more complicated because on the one hand, while it's an obvious of interest type solution. It's more complicated if it's either a lease or it's more complicated than that. And so it hasn't taken off to the extent that one would think, but may in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much. I have a question on, there's been a lot of like government stimulus programs. I was wondering how you've been seeing those rollout develop; embrace any potential red taper slowdowns in them or accelerations of that? Thank you so much.\nChris Leahy: Jim thanks for the question. Well, can I say they're rolling out as they typically do? And sometimes, that includes red tape and not all the things that you expect with government. I mean seriously, there's -- when we think about the federal budget that was passed, we're used to dealing with that, and we know where we can go find the funds. And I think that's been pretty kind of standard operating procedure, if you will. The Infrastructure Act is a little more to figure out where funds that can benefit our customers' vis-\u00e0-vis technology that's taking a little bit more time is what I'd say. But it's nothing that is daunting us or nothing that concerns us, frankly.\nJim Suva: Okay. And have you also been finding a lot of those new programs and systems have been kind of more on a higher-end service product offerings that you've had, say, today versus 5 or 10 years ago, meaning more like cloud and security and software solutions as opposed to more kind of plug-and-play hardware solutions?\nChris Leahy: Yes. That's -- that's a great point. The ability to access that funding for more advanced solutions is absolutely there. There's more demand for that versus merely client devices, for example. That's a good point. Security, another one that you tends to thread through all of the funding mechanisms at this point. So yes, that's a good point. And the answer is yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.\nKeith Housum: Good morning. Appreciate the opportunity. Chris, just looking at the hiring that you guys did over the year, 1,100 people through the first three quarters and then obviously, you guys were flat in the fourth quarter. I guess two things. One, is that kind of a testament to your thoughts on the overall market, perhaps weakening here as you guys went through the fourth quarter? And then what kind of people were you hiring during the year in order to meet your needs?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Keith, good morning. As we've been doing over the last few years, we've really been targeting our hiring in a couple of areas. It was the high demand, high capability. So think about the sales organization, think about the practice areas like technical specialists and security and cloud, software, the spaces that we've talked about and really targeting those areas. Along with what I would say is technologists and digital specialists for our own evolution of our business. That's really where we've been focusing. In terms of as we come into the back half of the year, just consider that disciplined management of the business. As we look out at the economy, as we see what's happening, we're just being very disciplined in the way that we're approaching our own cost management. And you'll see that in some tempering in our hiring in the back half of the year.\nKeith Housum: Great. I appreciate it. And then looking at your guide a little bit more, trying to unpack it. As you think about like the macro environment, are you expecting roughly a flat GDP? And where are you -- what kind of assumptions are you making for interest rates as you guys think about your guide?\nAl Miralles: Yes. Good morning, Keith. I would say just in terms of broad macro GDP, yes, I'd say flat, maybe slightly down, if you will. And so you get your translation from an IT market perspective with all of the components that we talked about, both our mix and uncertainty as well. Interest rates -- look, I don't know if we have a formal market view on that. Certainly, we make sure that the posture of our capital structure is protecting against that. We do have largely a fixed rate capital structure but we do have a component of our debt that's term loan, that's adjustable rate. And so the way we think about that is the most effective way to manage our interest rate risk is where we see there's risk there that we might pay down that debt a bit faster. You saw that in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to operate in that regard. And obviously, we think about that in the construct of our overall capital priorities.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on 2023 revenue growth guidance of 2% to 3%. I think it's a lower overall starting point than I can recall in many years. I know your split says the assumption is no market growth, but the largest global distributor just guided to double the growth rate that you're describing. So for investors that take this to mean that your share gain premium is effectively lowering inherently in this guidance, which is notable as we're shifting away from PCs. Maybe you could, Chris, opine on that market share premium piece as we move into a different environment from a mix perspective, away from transactional and towards solutions and tie in to your observations that you saw during Q4. Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Thanks, Adam. Let me just -- let me start with our guide, when our guide is coming versus when some of the other observations about the outlook for the market came out a month or 1.5 months ago. And the pivot that we've talked about in Q4, we started to see more dramatically end of November and into December. So that might be having an impact on how -- on the discrepancies that you're hearing. In terms of the 200 basis points to 300 basis points and the validity of the 200 basis points to 300 basis points, I think that question was the one you were asking, we still view that as our target go get. As we mentioned, Adam, and this might be what you're getting underneath. But as we mentioned, as we think about 2023 and the dynamics that we've seen in the fourth quarter of 2022, continuing into 2023, namely for us, stronger growth in cloud and Software-as-a-Service and security and more muted hardware sales. That does mean that our customer spend will be more meaningfully greater than the number, I think you gave a 2.5% figure. It will be meaningfully greater than that number. So we would look at that outperformance as 200 basis points to 300 basis points plus, if I could put it that way.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up, Al, on the Q1 guidance. In years past, CDW would talk about seasonal being down high-single-digits sequentially, 7%, 8% down. Today you're guiding flat to low-single-digit growth sequentially. And as I think about the mix of the business, with Sirius being in there, I would think it would be even more seasonal to Q1 given the enterprise focus. So maybe just help me understand the change now to seasonality versus historically. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Sure. Thanks, Adam. Look, the most notable thing I would just say is the Q4 was a very extreme period. And so as we look at Q1, you're right, seasonally, we would typically say there would be a contraction to Q1. And I guess what you should take from that is, while thematically, we'd still expect this mix into netted-down and lower transactional, maybe not as extreme as what we saw in Q4 and therefore, with some of that balancing out, we'd expect that we'd have modest growth on the top-line in the first quarter. And then again, a little more modest in terms of the gross margin. So just really kind of a bit of a dampening effect of the extremity that we saw in Q4.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand you back over to CDW for closing remarks.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Drew. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our 15,100 coworkers around the globe. Your ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you for joining CDW fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. You may disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2023. Then I'll hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our fourth quarter was an excellent example of the power of our business model when coupled with our broad and deep portfolio of technology solutions. In an extraordinary period of shifting customer priorities, we delivered record profitability. For the quarter, net sales were $5.4 billion, $100 million below 2021, and roughly flat on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP operating income was $523 million, 23% above last year; and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.50, up 21% year-over-year, up 22% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by the team's ability to pivot to meet customer priorities and capture high relevance, high growth opportunities. This led to excellent performance across services, cloud, security, and software. Performance that drove record profitability and exceptional outcome given market dynamics and an outcome that is a direct result of the investments we have made in solutions and services over the past several years. Simply put our ability to deliver outcomes across the full stack and full lifecycle of technology drove strong profit growth notwithstanding a meaningful decline in client devices. This quarter clearly demonstrates the power of our strategy when combined with the resiliency of our business model. So what happened to client devices this quarter? While we expected some level of contraction in client devices and accessories given the past two years of heavy investment, the magnitude of the decline in the fourth quarter was certainly steeper than anticipated. The primary driver was the K-12 market, which represented roughly half of the client device decline. We also saw a general moderation in client device demand across channels as economic uncertainty increased. As we always do, we stayed the course on our playbook and maintained our discipline with a focus on our customer and our value proposition. This discipline contributed to this quarter's excellent cash flows and strong economic returns. In Q4, the combination of lower transactional business and the team's success delivering on customer demand for solutions and services led to a meaningful shift in our sales mix. Let me put this in perspective for you. You've heard us speak over time about the impact of solutions mix and notably netted-down revenue streams on our financial results. As we have grown our netted-down revenue streams over time, total annual customer spend has consistently grown a few hundred basis points faster than net sales. In periods where we mix into more solutions business that nets down and mix out of client device business that fully shows up in net sales that growth rate spread will be wider. In Q4 an extreme mix shift took place. The result was meaningful customer spend growth significantly dampened net sales growth and very healthy gross margins that drove delivery of gross profit. Now let's turn briefly to the full-year results. 2022 was a year of financial performance underpinned by progress on our three-part strategy for growth. The first pillar of our strategy is to capture share and acquire new customers. One way we do this is through strategic acquisitions. The addition of Sirius is a great example of this. Sirius elevated and expanded our services capabilities providing an excellent cross-sell opportunity into our existing customer base. At the same time, Sirius customers represent excellent cross-sell opportunity given the broader CDW portfolio. The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions areas. Strategic coworker investments contributed to excellent solutions performance through 2022, with strong growth in cloud, security and network upgrades. The third pillar of our strategy is to expand services capabilities. As a key enabler of our value proposition, services are fundamental to our full stack, full lifecycle, full outcomes go-to-market approach. Services engagement solves critical customer problems and drive enduring customer relationships. In 2022, the team delivered more than 20% services growth across the business. No doubt, our acquisitions have accelerated our services breadth and depth and have been foundational to our success. 2022 was indeed a year of strategic performance across all three of our priorities. It was also a year of exceptional financial performance. The team delivered record results with constant currency net sales growth of 15% and each profit category down the P&L statement up 20% or more. Results enabled by ongoing investment in our three-part growth strategy, investments that have made us a vital technology partner, whether customers' priorities require transactional or highly complex solutions. You see the impact of these investments on our fourth quarter performance as the team pivoted to meet customer shifting priorities and advise, design and orchestrate full outcomes. Outcomes that deliver five key organizational benefits: innovation, lower cost, agility, risk mitigation, and enhanced experiences for customers and coworkers. Let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter. There were three main drivers of our fourth quarter results: our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio, and relentless execution of our three-part strategy. First, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion over the last 12 months. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of US$2.9 billion. Our corporate team delivered another strong quarter with a 7% sales increase. The team helps customers accelerate implementation of priorities to automate tasks, detect fraud and enhance customer and employee experiences. This drove excellent cloud software and security results. Our ability to address priorities focused on application and network modernization and consumption-based data center solutions led to excellent services and net comp performance, each up double-digits. Economic uncertainty led customers to de-prioritize endpoint solutions, which resulted in a decline in client devices. Small business declined 13%. The team pivoted to help customers address priorities to maximize prior IT investments and identify savings opportunities to fund new and ongoing projects. At the same time, the team helped customers address mission-critical priorities around security and take advantage of the benefits of cloud, both with heightened urgency. Strong growth from security and cloud were balanced against the decline in client devices as customers put upgrades on hold awaiting greater clarity around the economy and employment plans. Strong results across healthcare and government cannot offset the decline in education driven by K-12 client device dynamics and public sales decreased 9% year-over-year. The healthcare team delivered another excellent quarter of robust growth, up 8%. Talent needs and data center projects remain key focus areas as customers increasingly thought technology solutions to address complex industry challenges. This drove excellent performance in NetComm, servers and services. Mission-critical investments to enhance patient care and experience continued with telehealth and telesitting driving excellent collaboration performance. Government grew double-digits, up 13.5%. Strong state and local sales growth continued, driven by customer adoption of IT strategies for hybrid cloud, as well as network modernization and Zero Trust security frameworks. Services increased more than 50%, as the team helps state and local municipalities address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagements. Federal also continued to grow in the fourth quarter. The team's ability to help agencies achieve their priorities around data management drove excellent server and storage performance.  For education, higher ed high single-digit sales growth was more than offset by declines in K-12 and overall sales decreased. Higher ed continued their success helping implement student success programs, which institutions use to promote enrollment. Our ability to help drive program elements that include improved security, campus connectivity as well as enhanced storm room experiences drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, server, storage, software and security. For K-12, we expected a continuation of third quarter performance where sales were down low-double-digits but instead experienced a more significant decline with client device units down more than 68%. As we shared last quarter, K-12 customers continued to focus on digesting the past several years' investments and evaluating multi-year funding opportunities to ensure they are making the best decisions for the future. This quarter, as many schools achieved one-to-one student client device ratios, there was a significantly heightened focus on reevaluating plans, and demonstrating need for ECF awards. When the device per student ratio was below 1:1 demonstrating need was straightforward. Today, with device per student at or above the 1:1 ratio, demonstrating need is more complex. For example, articulating why new devices with higher processor capability are required to run more complex applications or provide greater security is just a more complicated discussion and takes more time and approval. This heightened focus led some customers to defer or retract awarded funding commitments in order to assess, reevaluate and potentially reapply under the third and final wave of ECF, which is scheduled to end December 31, 2023. For CDW, this equated to several hundred million dollars of CDW awarded funding commitments being pulled back. I should note that even with these dynamic variables in the K-12 client devices arena, the team successfully executed on infrastructure opportunities across services, NetComm and servers, leading to strong gross profit delivery. And just as we've been doing in past cycles with K-12, the team will be there for our customers to help them work through the challenges to achieve their mission-critical outcomes and efficiently utilize available funding mechanisms. Other, our combined UK and Canada results reflected broad-based and balanced performance in both regions in local currency. UK increased low-double-digits in local currency and Canada increased high-single-digits in local currency. These results continue to demonstrate the grit and resilience of our teams and the power of our investments to drive growth in these markets. As you can see, our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and a driver of our differentiated performance. The second driver of our performance was the broad and deep portfolio. Our ability to address priorities across the entire IT continuum delivered high-single-digit growth across our solutions portfolio. U.S. hardware sales declined mid-teens. Within hardware, network modernization upgrades drove double-digit increases in NetComm. These excellent results were not enough to offset the decline in client devices and wraparound accessories. Supply conditions continued to improve across core transactional areas, while supply and solutions categories remained tight. Once again, we exited the quarter with an elevated backlog and extended lead times and solutions and notably in NetComm. We continue to expect this backlog to feather out over time. U.S. software sales increased 8%. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment with strong double-digit increases in operating systems, application suites and data management. Cloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to profitability. Once again, gross profit increased by double-digits. Compute database, storage, mobility and connectivity were key cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase. Our teams delivered excellent results as they continue to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement identity and access management solutions and provide training to our customers to help manage cloud deployments and enhance endpoint and application security. Services results were stellar again this quarter, up more than 20% with balanced performance across professional and managed services. Services are integral to today's complex technology solutions. Customers continue to lean into CDW as an extension of their own teams and leverage CDW services as part of their strategy. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our three-part growth strategy. Clearly, investments in our customer-centric growth strategy contributed to our strong profitability this quarter. Investments in services and solutions have elevated our relevance to customers for the highest level it has ever been. Our rigorous strategic process that is designed to ensure we can serve customers across the full stack, full lifecycle has made us a vital technology partner, whether customers' priorities require transactional or highly complex solutions. And that leads us to our 2023 outlook. Our baseline view of the U.S. IT market in 2023 is for flattish growth, factoring in both expected mix and the level of overall economic uncertainty. Consistent with economic forecast, this outlook assumes stronger growth in the second half relative to the first half. We continue to target CDW market outperformance of between 200 basis points and 300 basis points. Our current view of the market recognizes we are operating under greater uncertainty as it incorporates the potential impact of some of our recent wildcards and indeed, most notably the economy. With thousands of sellers connecting with customers every day, we have a real-time pulse of the market. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Our fourth quarter results highlight that although we cannot definitively know where our customers will place their priorities; there are two things we know for sure. Technology will continue to be a critical driver of outcomes. And with our agility and broadened deep portfolio, we will be there to support our customers wherever their priorities now live. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Good morning, Matt. Yes. It's a good question. We have seen customers elongate the replacement cycle given the uncertain times. I mean you're seeing what we're seeing with hiring freezes and layoffs and things like that. So right now, there's just more pause than we had seen earlier in the year. Eventually, the benefit of enhanced productivity and security from the newer replacements will certainly drive a replacement cycle, but it's not happening right now with the level of uncertainty. A rebound? Yes. Our forecast contemplates the environment to feel pretty much like it feels now. That's what we've reflected in the forecast. I mean we do expect the PC market to remain larger than it was pre-pandemic. But right now, our forecast reflects the current environment and the current temperature. Good morning, Ruplu. Let me break that out. There are a couple of questions in there. Let me just start with the small business. And what I'd say on small business is the team is really executing well in a fairly cautious environment. And as I did mention, we are helping customers with priorities around infrastructure, networking, et cetera, primarily led by software and cloud. And of course, security is still top of mind. So what we're not seeing is a dampening in the small business of the need to modernize their infrastructure and maximize their prior investments. So we're seeing -- what I would say is continued steady demand from our small business customers for sure, with an emphasis again on cloud and security. In terms of the split, first half to second half of the year, I'm going to let Al address that in terms of the seasonality there. And then I think there was another question in there that you had, which was -- was there another question that you had? Yes. Here's what I'd say. I think as we've said for a while now, technology has become more vital to every walk of life into competitive advantage into success, et cetera. And we believe it's going to probably be more resilient to a challenging economic environment. Equally, given our business model and the strength of our portfolio, our ability to capture opportunity in a more difficult environment is pretty strong. But our expectation is for a level of resiliency in the technology space. Ruplu, it's Chris again. I would just add -- let me just add that as we think about the customer behavior more recently, and a lot of folks have been talking about extra signatures, a little more scrutiny, et cetera. Yes, we have been seeing that. We haven't been seeing is a pullback -- wholesale pullback in projects. In fact, those infrastructure projects that we had talked about being delayed a little bit are actually coming to the forefront. Again, back to the technology being essential to all of our customer base. So we are seeing that resiliency as well. Yes. And I would just add, we're never out of the market. We did have a pretty heavy year integrating Sirius, which is an incredibly successful and having an impact in the market. But we're always looking for organizations that can add capabilities in -- broadened capabilities, I should say, in high-growth, high relevance areas and also add scale to those practice areas that we've built if we can add scale at a faster pace, and we think about geography and our global presence. So we're always looking, and it's good to have a solid year of the Sirius integration behind us. Yes. No, it's a very fair question. And I would characterize it this way. We are seeing strong demand in the solutions space. And while we've had some supply feather out, I mean, where it's really moderated is on the client device space, some pockets in solutions but we're still carrying heavy backlog, particularly in NetComm. So the demand that you're seeing reflected in our performance is just that, it's demand, it's not a flow through of backlog. Good morning, Amit. Well, look, I wish I could say that it felt stronger out there. I really do, but that's not what the temperature is that we're feeling. So we build our expectations by listening to our customers. We've got thousands of sellers and technical advisers out there. And it's just the pulse that's coming back to us and looking at industry and partner data, we're feeling that it's going to be flattish. And then the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of premium that we always commit to would be on top of that. In terms of mix, I guess what I would say is we don't calculate in our customer spend versus net sales as an example. But of course, in this kind of environment, as we've explained, when you've got hardware that's more muted and you've got, in our case, netted-down solutions more heavily in the mix, you can expect more meaningful customer spend than the net sales line reflects. But that said, we are right now feeling flattish. Of course, we'll update you as we move through the year, but that's kind of where we feel right now. Yes. No, look, it's a great question, Erik, and it's all a matter of supply and demand, right? We're pretty particular in looking at organizations that really complement our suite of capabilities and/or scale them, along with the -- obviously, the financial return, but the fit in terms of culture. And I'll tell you, we've done eight over quarters and check, check, check. They've all been really outstanding. Now that said, there are companies out there that we think of and always reflecting on and some other larger transformational deal would certainly be something we'd consider. But it's a matter of finding them and making sure they're going to fit and provide the financial return. And you asked a question on the debt ratio, though, Al, did you want to tackle that? Okay. Erik, yes, so differences between enterprise and SMB in terms of the process. I would say that the -- look, larger enterprises have a muscle for this and we're dealing with that muscle, and we know how to deal with the muscle. The smaller business, frankly, turn to us for cost evaluation as a trusted partner. And so in some ways, we actually play this avid role with them, which is how do you figure out, where you make adjustments in your technology roadmap to achieve the cost effectiveness. So in terms of the behavior itself, I'd say small and medium-sized businesses are being cautious. Enterprises have kind of kicked in their muscle and they're doing the analysis that they do. But all of that said, we do continue to feel strong demand across all of our segments. Even K-12 that we've talked about, that was a real dynamic in the quarter. We're still very successful with them with network modernization, all the things that have to support the client devices. It's the demand. Demand is okay right now. Yes, Shannon, I'll take that. On the Infrastructure-as-a-Service, that is picking up. Our OEMs have been building that capability over time. And I'd say we've hit an inflection point where customers are eager to learn more and invest primarily enterprise, I would say, is a little stronger than the demand that we've seen in small business. On Device-as-a-Service that's a little more complicated because on the one hand, while it's an obvious of interest type solution. It's more complicated if it's either a lease or it's more complicated than that. And so it hasn't taken off to the extent that one would think, but may in the future. Jim thanks for the question. Well, can I say they're rolling out as they typically do? And sometimes, that includes red tape and not all the things that you expect with government. I mean seriously, there's -- when we think about the federal budget that was passed, we're used to dealing with that, and we know where we can go find the funds. And I think that's been pretty kind of standard operating procedure, if you will. The Infrastructure Act is a little more to figure out where funds that can benefit our customers' vis-a\u0300-vis technology that's taking a little bit more time is what I'd say. But it's nothing that is daunting us or nothing that concerns us, frankly. Yes. That's -- that's a great point. The ability to access that funding for more advanced solutions is absolutely there. There's more demand for that versus merely client devices, for example. That's a good point. Security, another one that you tends to thread through all of the funding mechanisms at this point. So yes, that's a good point. And the answer is yes. Yes. Keith, good morning. As we've been doing over the last few years, we've really been targeting our hiring in a couple of areas. It was the high demand, high capability. So think about the sales organization, think about the practice areas like technical specialists and security and cloud, software, the spaces that we've talked about and really targeting those areas. Along with what I would say is technologists and digital specialists for our own evolution of our business. That's really where we've been focusing. In terms of as we come into the back half of the year, just consider that disciplined management of the business. As we look out at the economy, as we see what's happening, we're just being very disciplined in the way that we're approaching our own cost management. And you'll see that in some tempering in our hiring in the back half of the year. Thanks, Adam. Let me just -- let me start with our guide, when our guide is coming versus when some of the other observations about the outlook for the market came out a month or 1.5 months ago. And the pivot that we've talked about in Q4, we started to see more dramatically end of November and into December. So that might be having an impact on how -- on the discrepancies that you're hearing. In terms of the 200 basis points to 300 basis points and the validity of the 200 basis points to 300 basis points, I think that question was the one you were asking, we still view that as our target go get. As we mentioned, Adam, and this might be what you're getting underneath. But as we mentioned, as we think about 2023 and the dynamics that we've seen in the fourth quarter of 2022, continuing into 2023, namely for us, stronger growth in cloud and Software-as-a-Service and security and more muted hardware sales. That does mean that our customer spend will be more meaningfully greater than the number, I think you gave a 2.5% figure. It will be meaningfully greater than that number. So we would look at that outperformance as 200 basis points to 300 basis points plus, if I could put it that way. Thank you, Drew. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our 15,100 coworkers around the globe. Your ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the fourth quarter and full-year, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $5.4 billion, down 1.8% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales declined 0.4%. Net sales were impacted by the significant change in client device demand during the quarter. With the decline in transactional products, there was a meaningful mix shift to solutions and services. Before moving down the rest of the P&L, I want to take a moment to talk about the impact of mixing into solutions and services on our results. Certain solutions such as Software-as-a-Service, software assurance and warranty solutions as well as aging commission fees generate meaningful customer spend but are recorded on a netted-down basis. Since we are not the primary obligor on these solutions, we record gross profit as our revenue. That is why you sometimes hear us refer to these netted-down revenues as 100% gross margin items. You certainly see the impact of this in both our net sales and our gross margin performance this quarter. As we continue to execute on our growth strategy and scale our solutions and services, we expect to continue to grow our netted-down revenue streams. All else equal, this mix dynamic will pressure net sales while remaining neutral to gross profit dollars and expanding gross margins. While much of what I've described is tied into the accounting treatment, it is also reflection of our success in the execution of our three-part strategy to capture share, enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions and expand services. The impact of this strategy was on full display this quarter as we experienced a significant mix shift out of client devices and into netted-down revenues, reflective of our customers' priorities. Returning to the P&L. Sequentially, net sales decreased 12.5% versus the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales historically decreased versus the third quarter but this quarter was exacerbated by the decline in demand for client devices. To dimensionalize the shortfall in net sales relative to our expectations, two-thirds of lower net sales were related to the public sector and driven primarily by K-12. In aggregate, solution categories delivered results above our expectations. Notwithstanding the noted mix shift of customer priorities, with respect to customer behavior, we did see increased scrutiny and deeper evaluation of projects and extra signatures increasingly required. In this environment, our sellers are staying close to their customers and working with their technical coworkers to help customers maximize return on investments. While we've not seen meaningful customer cancellations, we have seen some postponements and re-architecting on more complex hybrid cloud solutions as customers balance cost and utility. On the supply side, we saw similar conditions as in the third quarter with some improvement across categories but pockets of pressure remaining, especially in the solutions space. Our solutions backlog remains elevated versus historic levels and lead times are still extended. We expect our backlog to feather out over time as supply conditions ease, although not likely symmetrical across product categories. We continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers through this still uncertain supply environment. And just like our customers in this environment, our team is diligently managing working capital as we seek to enable profitable growth while ensuring strong economic returns. Our coworkers delivered excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 21.1%, lapping for the first time a one-month serious contribution in the fourth quarter of 2021. Gross profit margin was a record 21.7%, up 410 basis points versus last year and 190 basis points above our prior year quarter record. The year-over-year expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, product margins benefited from both mix into complex hybrid cloud solutions and lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, as we expected for the fourth quarter, a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. The category outpaced overall net sales growing 26% in Q4 2022 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Software-as-a-Service. And third, net sales contribution from high-margin services, which increased 28% in Q4 2022 compared to the prior year quarter with significant contribution from our recent acquisitions. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $658 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consistent with higher gross profit attainment and higher coworker count. SG&A declined by $26 million compared to the third quarter, reflecting the variable component of our compensation structure, which is principally tied to gross profit attainment. In this uncertain economic environment, we are also being mindful of our discretionary spending and our pace of our hiring. Our fourth quarter expense levels reflect both the benefits of our variable cost model and our prudent expense management. Coworker count at the end of the fourth quarter was nearly 15,100, up approximately 1,100 in the last year and essentially unchanged since the third quarter. Investments in our coworkers and in our strategy continue to be integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are focused on disciplined and balanced investments that drive value. This is evidenced by our record profitability in the period. GAAP operating income was $447 million, up 31.6% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $523 million, up 23.2%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 9.6%, up 190 basis points from the prior year and 80 basis points compared to the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, this improvement was driven by a confluence of favorable factors within gross margin. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $59 million. Higher interest expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius. This level of interest expense was in line with our expectation for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 24.7%. This resulted in fourth quarter tax expense of $94 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.2%, 30 basis points below our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5% due to lower state taxes as well as non-deductible items. As you can see on Slide 13, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.09. Our non-GAAP net income was $343 million in the quarter, up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.50, up 21%. Turning to full-year results on Slide 14 through 19. As Chris mentioned, 2022 performance reflected exceptional execution, relentless focus and a strategy that is working. Net sales were $23.7 billion, an increase of 14% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, full-year consolidated net sales grew 15.2%. On a combined constant currency basis, we estimate full-year sales increased 5%, below our prior expectation of 8.25% due to the moderation in IT market growth as well as a contraction in our premium in the fourth quarter. Gross profit was $4.7 billion, up 31.3% and grew 19.7%, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year. In 2022, software and services accounted for more than 40% of the total gross profit. Organic and inorganic investments in our services and solutions capabilities and a continued shift in the netted-down revenues are driving growth. Operating income was $1.7 billion and non-GAAP operating income was $2.1 billion, up 24.6%. Net income was $1.1 billion, and non-GAAP net income was $1.3 billion, up 19.9%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $9.79, up 22.9%. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $315 million and net debt was $5.6 billion. During the quarter, we reduced borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan by $200 million, consistent with our plan to reduce leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to Slide 21. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down three days from last year's fourth quarter, and within our range of high teens to low-20s, reflecting our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management, along with strong growth in the business also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $1.3 billion, as shown on Slide 22. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objective, including returning $80 million to shareholders through dividends in addition to $200 million in debt repayment, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 23. Our execution remains consistent with objectives we communicated last quarter. For 2023, we're updating those objectives as follows: first, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. This increase demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business. Going forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the fourth quarter at 2.6x net leverage, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash flow generation. As we expected and communicated during the third quarter call, 2.6x had us near the lower end of our 2022 targeted net leverage of 2.5x to 3x. For 2023 and beyond, our targeted net leverage ratio will be 2x to 3x, a range that is consistent with our commitment to an investment-grade capital structure and provides us with flexibility to proactively manage liquidity over time. Finally, we have successfully satisfied the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. As such, we are pleased to have reestablished our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A, and share repurchases, respectively in 2023. For 2023, we will target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. This is supported by the Board's authorization for a $750 million increase in the company's share repurchase programs. Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 24. While we are cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to execute, pivoted growth opportunities and outperform the broader market. While the overall IT market growth rate sentiment has been mixed, in the near-term, we continue to expect netted-down revenues will grow faster than other product and solution categories. With this in mind, we expect the IT market to be approximately flattish, reflecting our expectation of mix and the level of economic uncertainty. We maintain our long-held expectation to outgrow the market by 200 basis points to 300 basis points per year. Currency is expected to be neutral for the full-year, with modest headwinds in the first half and modest tailwinds in the second half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.24 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar in the first quarter. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the mid to high 8% range. We expect full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be at the upper end of a mid-single-digit range in constant currency. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter related to average daily sales, we expect low-single-digit sequential growth from Q4 to Q1. This equates to a mid-single-digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline for the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued strong gross profit margin and NGOI margin in the first quarter above the full-year 2022 levels for both but reflecting some moderation from what we experienced in Q4. And we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low-single-digits year-over-year. Finally, in line with the reevaluation of our capital priorities, we're adjusting our long-term rule of thumb for full-year free cash flow. In 2023, we expect full-year free cash flow to be within a range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales, up from our prior range of 3.75% to 4.25%. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter and across years. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yes. Good morning, Matt. This is Al. We are not seeing -- I would say ASPs in the fourth quarter and ongoing continue to be really firm. And so that is not contemplated in our outlook. And good morning, Ruplu. On the -- on your question on seasonality, so first, just look, our outlook is based on the premise, we continue to see strength in software and services and lower growth in terms of hardware overall. With respect to the timing of that, first half, our typical seasonality would be first half 48, 49, we'd expect to maybe be slightly below that in the first half, and that's reflective of that continued slope towards more netted-down revenues and cloud, security, et cetera with the expectation that in the second half, you may see a pickup there, more on the client device. And so second half a bit stronger in terms of top-line impact, if you will. Sure. So let me just start with the operating margin. So operating margin, I would most notably point to expectation that we would continue to be somewhat higher on gross margin in 2023 versus 2022. I certainly would not expect that those gross margins would match what we saw in Q4, which was really extraordinary. But I would just start from that square that somewhat higher gross margins in 2023 will certainly drive our NGOI margin, coupled with expectation we'd have some operating leverage there. To your original question on netted-down revenues for the quarter, you're right. Our prepared remarks noted that netted-down revenues grew 26% year-over-year. On a percentage of GP basis, Ruplu, that was 31% in the fourth quarter, so continue to be really strong. Let me just start, and then Chris can add on from an M&A perspective. So as you know, our capital priorities reopened both M&A and share repurchase. And the way that I would think about that, as I spoke to that range of our free cash flow of 50% to 75%, we would expect return to shareholders. So if you take the dividend, you can get a sense for what that range would look like. There is a range there because we view that as really optionality for us to tackle between what's going to drive the longest strategic value, including M&A as well as what's going to maximize shareholder return in the more near-term. And so look, both of those options and array of options are available to us. We're certainly back on the path of share repurchases, but M&A is also on horizon as well. Good morning, Amit. We are not seeing any level of cancellation or postponements there. The demand on NetComm, and you can see from our reported results, really, really strong. We're not getting a lot of help from a supply perspective, honestly. Extended lead times is still there. Our backlog has not moved substantially really -- our backlog has moved more in client, as Chris suggested, supply is still -- there's still friction there on the NetComm side, but that's notwithstanding really strong written demand. Sure. So Erik, obviously, we're within our stated range, and I noted that our new leverage range is 2x to 3x. So certainly, we have room in that regard. And I would say as we think about M&A, certainly, smaller bolt-on as we've certainly done plenty of. We can do that with free cash flow and with our existing net leverage capacity. As we think about things bigger, obviously, we're going to look at what's the best use of our capital, which could include taking on more debt and could include other avenues. I will just note that while our goal is to stay within that investment-grade capital structure. Certainly, from the rating agencies, we get some room there that if you do larger M&A and you go beyond that, you have a grace period, if you will, and you have time that you then get back into that range. So all of that would be contemplated in our calculus as we think about deals. Good morning, Shannon. So a few things. One, our -- we talked about our rule of thumb for free cash flow, and we raised that and I would say that's a reflection of our continued improvement and progress on really effectively managing working capital and also a somewhat of an effect or supported by the countercyclical nature of the business. So obviously, as this economic environment kind of moderates a bit, it actually helps from a cash flow perspective. So both of those things kind of in play. Your comment about netted-down or question about netted-down is a good one. It is a bit of a mathematical exercise. But just recall with our netted-down revenues, that while they show up in our net sales net, we're actually collecting gross dollars. So what that does from a cash conversion cycle perspective, it actually has the tendency to increase the DSO, increase DPO given the denominators and the numerator. So the way we think about that is really on a net basis. And can we continue to make progress within that band of high teens, low-20s on cash conversion. So all of those factors we consider as we're managing the business, including the puts and takes relative to our investments in inventory as well as how we manage AR and AP. So that's all part of really a dynamic operating model around working capital, and we're making really good progress on that front. Yes. Good morning, Keith. I would say just in terms of broad macro GDP, yes, I'd say flat, maybe slightly down, if you will. And so you get your translation from an IT market perspective with all of the components that we talked about, both our mix and uncertainty as well. Interest rates -- look, I don't know if we have a formal market view on that. Certainly, we make sure that the posture of our capital structure is protecting against that. We do have largely a fixed rate capital structure but we do have a component of our debt that's term loan, that's adjustable rate. And so the way we think about that is the most effective way to manage our interest rate risk is where we see there's risk there that we might pay down that debt a bit faster. You saw that in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to operate in that regard. And obviously, we think about that in the construct of our overall capital priorities. Sure. Thanks, Adam. Look, the most notable thing I would just say is the Q4 was a very extreme period. And so as we look at Q1, you're right, seasonally, we would typically say there would be a contraction to Q1. And I guess what you should take from that is, while thematically, we'd still expect this mix into netted-down and lower transactional, maybe not as extreme as what we saw in Q4 and therefore, with some of that balancing out, we'd expect that we'd have modest growth on the top-line in the first quarter. And then again, a little more modest in terms of the gross margin. So just really kind of a bit of a dampening effect of the extremity that we saw in Q4."

Al will provide additional details on the financials and outlook as well as our capital-allocation priorities. And then we'll move right to your questions.  We had an outstanding third quarter. Once again, we delivered all-time record sales, profits and margins. Net sales were $6.2 billion, 17% higher than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $449 million, up 26%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.60, up 22% year-over-year. This exceptional performance is a result of our relentless execution and disciplined investment in our customer-centric strategy, a strategy that underpins our ability to address customer priorities across a broad array of end markets with solutions across the full stack and full life cycle of IT.  The vital need for interconnected and integrated solutions has created levels of complexity never seen before. We cut through the complexity and help customers maximize the impact of technology, technology that delivers mission-critical outcomes.  In today's environment of persistent uncertainty, our customers are increasingly leaning on CDW as a trusted partner, and they look to us to provide unbiased expert advice across the entire spectrum of IT. A trusted partner who helps them tackle their most pressing priorities, pressing priorities like advancing their digital transformation, driving innovation and delivering exceptional stakeholder experiences, along with enhancing security and supporting collaboration in today's distributed environment of work, learn and live everywhere. Priorities that deliver operating efficiency and expense elasticity like burstable billing and modern hybrid and multi-cloud environments and infrastructure and new technology investments to optimize flexibility and agility. Our ability to enable solutions in support of all these diverse priorities drove broad-based and balanced performance.  There were 3 main drivers of our results: our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio and the relentless execution of our 3-part strategy. First, the breadth and diversity of our customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: corporate; small business; health care; government; and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $2 billion to over $10 billion over the last 12 months. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals.  We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of USD 2.9 billion. Our portfolio approach enables us to toggle to the best pockets of opportunity and to be there for our customers along every step of their IT journeys. Our collective team did an exceptional job this quarter. Our corporate team delivered another stellar quarter with a 25% net sales increase. Results were balanced and broad-based. Customers continued to focus on digital transformation through infrastructure modernization and process automation. The team's ability to deliver these outcomes translated to excellent solutions growth led by NetComm, Enterprise Storage and Cloud.  Both professional and managed services posted double-digit increases as the team helped customers achieve their IT priorities by augmenting their technology capabilities with dedicated technologists. The hybrid work environment continues to thrive with continued customer focus on collaboration across workspaces and continued need to modernize their employee experience.  Small business delivered growth for the seventh straight quarter, a 5% increase on top of last year's 39% growth. The team continued to help small business customers navigate the impact of technology across all aspects of their business into today's cautious environment and accomplish critical projects that enhance and sustain mission and business outcomes. This drove double-digit performance across software, security and cloud. Our full stack, full life cycle support for customers, which enables us to nimbly shift towards solutions that maximize prior investments led to double-digit performance in services.  Public posted a strong 13% increase this quarter. The health care team delivered another excellent quarter of robust growth, up 28%. Once again, results were driven by the team's ability to help health care organizations harness technology to drive productivity in an environment of rising costs. Our health care customers are increasingly relying on CDW for talent orchestration and to guide their implementations of cloud resources. Health care organizations face complex business dynamics, but they are committed to mission-critical projects and data center and collaboration modernization continues to move forward.  Government posted 38% growth. Within government, state and local posted a substantial double-digit increase. Our collaboration with customers to identify and capture various funding opportunities is bearing fruit with data center and software projects beginning to advance under multiyear phrasing. The team delivered excellent security results as they help state and local municipalities enhance their defenses against emerging and evolving cyber threats. Remote collaboration continues as a top priority, driving excellent performance across transactional product categories.  As expected, federal activity resumed in earnest. Seasonal spending patterns normalized with the September fiscal year-end spending uptick. The team helps customers address their top priorities, including upgrades to collaboration and data management infrastructure. This drove strong growth in nearly all categories compared to last year.  For education, higher ed growth was more than offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall sales decreased 7.5%. The higher-ed team continued to deliver student success programs to institutions. These programs promote enrollment through comprehensive endpoint solutions and improved campus connectivity and safety and drive client devices sales and NetComm growth.  Security remains very -- security demands were high, driven by solutions that addressed ransomware and hacking threats through CDW-delivered security enhancements. K-12 performance remains strong on an absolute basis, but was obscured by the team's exceptional client device driven success in 2021. Today, the team is helping school systems determine how to sustain prior IT investments and maintain the learning opportunities provided by digital equity initiatives. At the same time, the team continues to help customers implement industry-leading innovative connective learning spaces as well as enhanced campus safety. And this drove strong security and audio-visual performance during the quarter.  Other, our combined U.K. and Canada results increased 18% on a reported basis. Both regions delivered excellent local market growth. The U.K.'s performance was broad-based and balanced as our team showed resolved and resiliency in a complex environment. Canada's performance was also broad-based and balanced with customer priorities similar to the U.S. amid a continued shift into solutions and services.  All in, the teams delivered another excellent quarter of end-market performance. Our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and a driver of our differentiated performance.  The second driver of our portfolio -- of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio. As technology has become a more vital part of their strategies, customers require comprehensive, integrated and interconnected solutions and services. Our ability to address these priorities across the entire IT continuum delivered double-digit growth across our solutions portfolio.  U.S. hardware increased 13%. This steady performance was on top of 2021 [Technical Difficulty] quarter double-digit hardware growth. Network modernization and upgrades drove double-digit increases in Enterprise Storage and NetComm. Video and audio and servers increased healthy single-digit rates.  Commercial PC performance was strong on a relative basis and even more so when we exclude the year-over-year impact of growth from the K-12 market. Relative to the supply environment, conditions improved across several transactional areas. Despite these improvements during the quarter, our overall backlog remains elevated. We expect the backlog to continue to feather out over the coming quarters. U.S. software increased double digits. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment with strong double-digit increases in storage management, application suites and database management. Cloud was an important driver of performance across the business. Complexity surrounding cloud has not changed and navigating between multiple options remains a major area of customer focus. Once again, cloud was a meaningful contributor to profitability with both customer spend and gross profit up by double digits.  Infrastructure as a Service, productivity, security, application delivery and connectivity were key cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase. Our teams continue to guide customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation to improve their security frameworks and respond to increasing threats. This drove strong double-digit growth in customer spend.  U.S. services performance continued to advance this quarter. Customers are leaning into CDW as extensions of their own teams and leveraging CDW services as part of their strategies. This produced broad-based and balanced growth driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. Services net sales were roughly twice last year's levels and represented 8% of total sales, up from 5% in 2021. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and are a key enabler of our value proposition.  To support this, we have been making organic and inorganic investments in services over the past several years and those investments quickly gained traction in the market.  And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our 3-part growth strategy. Our targeted investments are guided by our 3-part strategy, which is: one, to capture share and acquire new customers; two, to enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions areas; and three, to expand services capabilities. This strategy delivers on our commitments to our customers and drives both our top line and bottom-line performance. Over the past 3 years, we have enhanced our relevance to customers by broadening and deepening our capabilities, including in automation, cloud-native and DevOps and cybersecurity. Capabilities necessary to ensure we remain the trusted adviser to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformations. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers across physical, digital and cloud-based environments in the U.S. and internationally.  A great example of how our services investments deepen relationships and strengthen the value we deliver to customers is a solution we are delivering to a medium-sized hospital system. With 3 primary hospitals and approximately 70 regional clinics and urgent care facilities, the system was challenged to find, retain and train a sustainable level of technical staff. Having previously worked with them, providing both hardware solutions and professional services to re-architect their disaster-recovery solution, we had a deep understanding of our customers' environment.  We coupled with the breadth and depth of our services offering, this enabled us to construct a new design, build, run end-to-end services solution that leverages CDW managed services and talent orchestration capabilities. A solution made possible by the services investments we have made and the technical mastery we've accelerated over recent years, mastery over the broad spectrum of technologies the customer needed for support, including Windows and Linux servers, virtualization, storage, backup and recovery, databases, switching, routing, network access and cloud-based productivity and identity-management tools, our full portfolio of services enabled us to become an extension of the customer's team.  We recently went live under a 5-year contract with monthly recurring revenue in the hundreds of thousands and a total contract value over $10 million. A great example of how our investment and services deliver value to our customers and cause them to lean further into CDW.  Investments in our customer-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our team's terrific execution and relentless focus on our customers delivered significant out-performance to our baseline 2022 outlook. When combined with our current expectations for fourth quarter performance, we now expect to outperform the U.S. IT market at the high end of the 325 to 425 basis points range. Our estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2022 remains 4%.  Taken together, this equates to year-over-year constant-currency growth at the high end of the 7.25% to 8.25% range. The high end of the range is applied to the combined CDW 2021 revenues of $22.8 billion, calculated as though Sirius was acquired on January 1, 2021, instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1. On a reported basis, this equates to a constant-currency increase of 18.5% over 2020 results.  Our outlook continues to reflect our baseline expectations that our mix will remain weighted more heavily to netted-down items. We expect this to drive profit growth faster than sales growth, while we continue to thoughtfully invest in our future. We are cognizant of the current environment, but to date, customer urgency to innovate for the future and the internal and external stakeholder demand has not diminished. Of course, we remain mindful of wildcards, including economic, geopolitical and the variable nature of the supply chain, and we will keep a watchful eye on these and other potential factors. As we always do, we will provide an updated view on business conditions and our annual outlook on our next call.  In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Our flexible business model and proven formula for success will continue to serve us well. The accelerated pace of change makes our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers, more important now than ever.  Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\nAlbert Miralles: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2022 outlook.  Turning to our third quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $6.2 billion, up 17.3% on a reported and an average daily-sales basis. On a constant-currency average daily-sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 18.7%. Sequentially, sales increased 1.1% versus the second quarter. Third quarter sales were in line with our expectations, reflecting broad-based and balanced growth across our portfolio.  On the supply side, some conditions improved during the quarter, resulting in an overall reduction in our backlog. While supply and lead times of client devices have indeed improved, pockets of pressure remain, especially in solution categories and our backlog remains very elevated. As we've previously shared, we would expect our backlog to feather out over time as supply conditions can begin to ease and this will not likely be symmetrical across product offerings. We continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers who is still uncertain about supply environment, and the team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages to ensure strong returns on working capital.  We once again had an excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 34.8%. Gross profit margin was a record 19.8%, up 250 basis points versus last year. The expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, as we expected for the second half of the year, a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. The category grew nearly twice as fast as overall net sales, primarily driven by Software as a Service.  Second, product margins were strong, driven by both mix and demand for certain hardware products; and third, net sales contribution from high-margin services, which increased 70% year-over-year as a result of our recent acquisitions.  Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $684 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consisting with higher gross profit attainment and higher coworker count. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was nearly 15,000, up approximately 400 from the prior quarter, reflecting investments in coworkers that support high-growth solutions and services as well as our own digital transformation. Investments in our coworkers and in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are focused on disciplined and balanced investments that will pay dividends. This is evidenced by our record sales and profitability in the period.  GAAP operating income was $466 million, up 20.7% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $549 million, up 26.2%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 8.8%, up 60 basis points from the prior year and 40 basis points compared to the second quarter.  Overall, while we're very pleased with this outcome, it was above our expectations and driven by a confluence of factors within gross margin, including a favorable mix and rate of product margins, which we'd expect to moderate in Q4.  Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $63 million. Higher interest expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius as well as the effect of higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. This level of interest expense was in line with our expectation for the quarter. We have not changed our expectation of approximately $240 million for the full year.  Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 25.4%. This resulted in a third quarter tax expense of $101 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 60 basis points versus last year's rate as a result of an increase in nondeductible expenses and state taxes.  As you can see on Slide 13, the third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.17. Our non-GAAP net income was $357 million in the quarter, up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.60, up 22%.  Year-to-date results can be found on Slides 14 through 19. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $358 million and net debt was $5.8 billion. During the quarter, we reduced borrowings under a senior unsecured term loan by $400 million, consistent with our plan to reduce leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.5 billion.  Moving to Slide 21. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down 7 days from last year's third quarter and at the low end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting the impact of Sirius and our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management, along with strong growth in the business also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, as shown on Slide 22.  For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital-allocation objectives, including returning $68 million to shareholders through dividends in addition to the $400 million in debt repayment, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 23.  Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income, including today's 18% increase to the dividend from $2 to $2.36 per share. The increased annual dividend represents approximately 25% of a trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income through September. The Q4 2022 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation in the business and marks the ninth consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013. Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 34% from its initial level. Going forward, we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings.  Second, we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the third quarter at 2.7x, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash generation. While we're at the middle of our targeted net leverage range, we are balancing rating agency capital expectations, which would call for us to be towards the bottom of our range. As such, we will continue to prioritize delevering until we are more firmly in our targeted net leverage range and can satisfy the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022.  And finally, while we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital-allocation objectives of M&A and share repurchases, we are firmly on the path to getting back to these priorities.  Moving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 24. While we're cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to execute, pivot to growth opportunities and outperform the broader market. We continue to expect the fourth quarter will reflect a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted-down revenues as a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins, all else equal.  With this in mind, we continue to expect U.S. market growth of 4% and now expect to be at the upper end of our 325 to 425 basis point range of CDW market out-performance in constant currency, on a combined basis. Recall, we previously shared, we would expect to be at the higher end of our premium range if supply improves. Conversely, if we experience elevated levels of supply constraints, or mix more into netted-down revenue streams, we would expect to be at the mid- to lower end of our premium range. On a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius.  On a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 18.5% growth in constant currency. The change in currency exchange rates from our initial original outlook is now expected to be a headwind of $110 million to net sales in the fourth quarter and $260 million for the full year. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.13 to the British pound and $0.73 for the Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter.  Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. This implies the fourth quarter will be the fourth consecutive quarter of 20% or higher operating profit growth. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to approximately 23.5% full year growth in constant currency on a reported basis.  I would remind you that 2021 would have been $8.49 per share on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97 per share, which included only 1 month of Sirius. The change in currency exchange rates from our original outlook is now expected to be a headwind of -- to EPS of $0.04 in the fourth quarter and $0.08 for the full year. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant-currency basis.  Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter, related to average daily sales, we expect a 0 to low single-digit sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. This equates to 9.75% to 10.75% year-over-year reported net sales growth rate for the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued strong gross profit margin and NGOI margin in the fourth quarter at or above year-to-date average levels for both, reflecting some moderation from what we experienced in Q3. And we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the range of 18.25% and 19.25% year-over-year on a reported basis.  Finally, we now expect full year free cash flow to be approximately 5% of net sales, exceeding the top end of our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter and across years. If you recall, 2021 free cash flow was 2.3% of net sales. In aggregate, we expect our 2021 and 2022 free cash flow to balance out and be within our free cash flow rule of thumb over the 2 years.  That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls.  And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to 1 with a brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Shannon Cross at Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: I guess I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the EBIT, and it was very strong this quarter, obviously, and gross margin was strong. And I'm wondering how we should think about the progression as netted-down revenue becomes a larger percentage of the total -- I realize, obviously, some of it was probably from lower-client contribution. But it seems that the model towards maybe a bit higher than EBIT guidance over time might be in place?\nAlbert Miralles: Yes. Shannon, this is Al. So happy to address that. So as I mentioned, the NGOI margin and dollar result was largely driven by strong gross margin. So if we just take the components of gross margin for the quarter, a few things, Shannon, that I would note first, obviously, the benefit and accretive effect from Sirius which we've seen all year.  Number two, the effect of netted-down revenues, right, largely driven by focus on security, cloud, Software as a Service. We would view that component as pretty structural.  Next, I would say, contributions from services. Again, we've made a lot of investments in that space. So we view that as largely structural. And then the last component of our gross margin, Shannon, would be on the product side. And we've talked about through the year that we've had really favorable, both mix and rate on the product side. And that would be the 1 variable that we would see potentially could moderate. And so obviously, in this supply environment, we've seen our customers favor a bit more speed over price. And that's led to a favorable mix and also strong rates. And so obviously, as we start to see supply ease a bit here, you could see that moderate, and that's what we're tending towards for Q4.\nShannon Cross: Okay. And then if you can just talk a bit more about client. I know you provided some comments during the remarks. But if you could talk maybe what you're hearing from your customers in terms of what they're thinking about PC purchases as we look forward, is there any indication that some of the Chromebooks that perhaps were placed in 2020 will need to be refreshed? Or are there any education dollars that are available for that? Just any more color you can give would be great.\nChristine Leahy: Shannon, it's Chris. I'll give you some color maybe on the overall PC trends we're seeing. And as expected, overall, the PC environment has moderated a bit versus the robust client device growth in 2021. But that said, our end markets are not synchronized. So looking at the client-device growth across channels, for example, we helped customers with pent-up demand in our government segment in both federal and state and local.  Obviously, K-12 was down as expected, but our other segments, Commercial Healthcare, higher-ed channels, what they saw was upgrade experience, not right now a broad refresh but upgrading of experience, meaning higher-value PCs along with the collaboration tools and automation that helps with that experience.  What I would say is, I can't tell you exactly which channels are going to start picking up their client devices soon, but we are continuing to see the criticality of client devices [Technical Difficulty]. And so at the end of the day, we'll continue to profitably outperform the PC market for several reasons. Number one, as we've said before, there's a very compelling commercial PC opportunity. When you think about the value PCs deliver -- so employee productivity, for example, and use cases and also PC product cycle. We're already seeing some customers who are moving to Windows 11, a number of customers moving to Windows 11, particularly for things like security updates.  And then the natural refresh. We've talked a lot about the aging of devices from 2018, '19, '20, and we'll see those refreshes start to kick in. The other thing is think about the services that CDW wraps around PCs, which are very attractive to our customers. There are massive market opportunity available to us, addressable market opportunities when we think about cross-selling to our Sirius customers and also international.  And then the thing I finally say is that CDW has got the absolute best PC muscle in infrastructure, which has allowed us to outperform the market significantly in the past. And remember, when our partners are looking to move the needle in any arena, they look to CDW to help them do that. So very confident PCs are critical to the future, moderated a bit, but still fundamentally part of the solution customers are looking for.  What I would say is right now, in terms of prioritizing, our customers are largely leaning into their infrastructure, the things that they had not invested in over the last couple of years, so infrastructure, cloud, security, things like that and priority and PCs are a little lower on the priority list.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess the first one, you obviously have a very sizable upside to gross profit dollars despite the revenue that we think in line with consensus. Maybe to talk about how much of that is a structural shift towards more netted-down revenues versus perhaps mix of a bit more favorable. And really the talk about the netted-down revenue map, I'm curious, at some point, does it start making sense, Chris, to talk about your ability to grow gross profit dollars at premium to IT spend versus talking about revenues going at premium to IT spends?\nAlbert Miralles: Yes. Amit, this is Al. So similar to my response to Shannon there, really, if you tick down the list, again, the kind of the priority order of what contributed in gross margin, Sirius for sure, netted-down revenue, contributions from services and then on the product side. And I would say that both the netted down and the contributions from services would be deemed a bit more structural. Certainly, from a product margin perspective, there's a structural component, but you're going to vary depending on mix in any given period. And so that's what we've been seeing.  To your question on guiding on gross profit, that's certainly something, Amit, that we talk about. Just remember beauty of our deep and broad portfolio means at any given time, you're going to have puts and takes in terms of where things show up and what our customers need. And so what we discussed really there is there are going to be periods where there's stronger hardware contribution and refreshes and those types of things. And that's where certainly focusing on the net sales is important as well. But as time goes by, and particularly as we see some of the supply conditions change, certainly, we'll talk more about kind of the contribution of gross profit and how we think about that from an outlook perspective.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I just follow up, there's really notable deviation, I think, in the growth we're seeing out of the SMB bucket versus corporate. I know you talked about kind of what's driving this trend with net count that commentary and so on. But maybe just tell on why are we seeing such a big divergence? And then is 1 a more leading indicator or not? Or is that not the way to think about it? Just any help on the deviation would be helpful.\nChristine Leahy: Amit, it's Chris. On small business, it's been interesting. I would just start with the execution from the team. It's a cautious environment for sure, but the team is really helping customers navigate what's become ubiquitous impacts of technology across literally every aspect of their business. And in the small-business arena, like all of our customers right now, there's a focus on mission-critical priorities. And that tends to be software, cloud and security led. And so CDW, with the capabilities we've built within that segment, you'll recall we separated it out about 4, 5 years ago, we bring the full stack, full life cycle support for customers. And we've been able to, over the past several quarters, really nimbly shift towards the solutions that maximize their prior investments and add services to the mix there.  So look, we continue to see momentum behind the strategic execution in small business, and we're really confident in our ability to leverage our broad-solution portfolio and pivot where the customers need us. And that right now is infrastructure solution and modernizing and optimizing and securing their networks.  What I would say also is this notion that technology has become more critical to business strategy is the same in small businesses. It's really no difference there. So thematically, customers are very much prioritizing their technology investments. And while there's pressure on budgets for sure, and customers are being prudent, technology is getting a priority. So the pulse of our customers is pretty strong right now, and we're just staying very close to them in what's top of mind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring at Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Maybe I'll have one for each of you. So Chris, maybe if I just start with you. Maybe can you help us understand what has been the biggest change to either kind of your end-market outlook or your customer discussions since we all were on your 2Q call 90 days ago, anything that is notable that you'd call out in terms of changes, either it's positive or negative? And then I have a follow-up.\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Sure, Erik. Here's what I'd say between the 2 calls. And it's the words I just used before, where there's certainly, I'd say, incrementally more pressure on budgets generally for our customers. Look, there's persistent uncertainty out there. And when that happens, there's just pressure. That said, customers are being prudent and what we are seeing consistently is notwithstanding that added scrutiny. Technology is being prioritized because it's reframed from a cost center to an asset of innovation, an enabler of cost efficiency and agility and risk mitigation and resilience and experience. So technology touches everything that drives competitive advantage for our customers. Further, we are continuing to see a scarcity of talent in the market, coupled with the heightened complexity that technology brings and security risks continue to essentially explode. So you have all of that happening in a more pressured budget environment.  The good news for CDW is in those environments, our customers lean even more into CDW. And so the strategy that we've been executing with discipline over the last few years, has created -- has really strengthened our value prop. I would say our value proposition and the broad-based portfolio, particularly of solutions and services has never been stronger. It's never been more relevant. It's never been more resonant with our customers and they can look to us to help them make the best decisions in an unbiased outcome-based way. So I guess the point is more pressure right now, persistent uncertainty, but that actually drives the need for CDW even more.\nErik Woodring: Perfect. That's really helpful. And then, Al, maybe a follow-up for you. Historically, you do see a sequential expansion of gross margins in the December quarter. You made some comments about margin rates moderating from 3Q. So maybe if you could just help us understand, again, some of the moving pieces as we think about 4Q margins, whether that's on the growth -- gross and/or operating side, just so we could think about what that might mean for seasonality versus what normal seasonality has historically looked like? And that's it for me.\nAlbert Miralles: Yes, sure. Thanks, Erik. So look, I would say Q4, I think, is going to be a decent reflection of what we've seen year-to-date, which has been really strong margins, both gross margins and NGOI. Q3 was exceptional. And I think I've called out some of the areas that really drove that, particularly on the product margin side. So I would say it's stay the course pretty much on par with what we've seen for the year, notwithstanding that, again, as we start to see this feathering out of supply, it's conceivable you could see a bit of a moderation on the product margin side. So that's basically been what you've seen year-to-date is low 19s on gross margin and low 8s on NGOI margin may be slightly better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum at Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: Question for you guys on price increases that we've seen over the past year. Have you guys seen a moderation of those price increases from the vendors and your ability to pass those on? And how has your customers buying decisions changed as most recently as a result of those based on the current environment?\nChristine Leahy: Keith, it's Chris. Yes, I would say on the price increases, first of all, the ubiquitous across the industry. We haven't seen them abate really. We have been able to pass them along. And right now, given the continued supply constraints and the prioritization of technology, we're not expecting to see those abate anytime soon because customers are okay taking those on. We might start to see that sometime in 2023. But for right now, they're holding strong.\nKeith Housum: Great. And what kind of -- and how should that contribute to actually your top-line growth you say this quarter?\nAlbert Miralles: Yes, Keith, I'll take that. So I would -- it varies by channel and obviously varies by products. Certainly, there are pockets where we've had very solid unit growth. And then in some cases where net sales is more bolstered by ASP. And so that's going to vary by channel and by product.  But back to Chris' point, I would say, for the quarter and what we see now, ASPs continue to be firm. But we're certainly cognizant as supply changes, potentially some customer behaviors change, you could maybe see a bit of that easing of that, and that's why we're just being a little bit prudent on the product margin side.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: I have 1 question on revenue growth and 1 on margin expansion.\nChristine Leahy: Ruplu, we can't hear you.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Can you hear me?\nChristine Leahy: Not quite.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Can you hear me?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Perfect. Thank you.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Great. Sorry about that. I had 1 question on revenue growth and 1 on margin expansion. So maybe I'll first the first one on revenue growth to you, Chris. At a high level, when we look at the commentary in the prepared remarks, it seems to indicate that there's ongoing strong end-market demand. And yet, you are seeing some deceleration in year-on-year growth first half versus second half. So like the second half is growing mid-teens year-on-year based on your full year guidance versus low 20% year-on-year growth in the first half.  That's still strong growth, but it is a decel. So my question is, are you seeing any end-market demand deceleration in any end markets? Or is it all just a matter of more netted-down items and a change in mix?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, Ruplu, I would tell you that it is more mix than demand generated. Really, as we had expected, we have mixed more heavily into netted-down items, even a little bit more than we expected, and that really is the main driver of the pressure on the top line. And that's -- from a deceleration perspective, like I said before, there's pressure. PCs have moderated, as we said. But really, otherwise, we're seeing what I would consider pretty robust demand and performance as a result.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe I'll ask the margin question to Al. So the full year guide is for a low 8% operating margin, and that's really good margin performance compared to your peers. But my question would be like can you talk to us about factors that can drive margin expansion beyond that? And if the U.S. were to go into a more protracted recession, can you still expand margin? So what do you need to have either from a revenue growth standpoint or a mix standpoint? I mean do you think that even in a slower demand environment or in a recessionary environment, are there factors, are there levers that you have to expand margins beyond this?\nAlbert Miralles: Sure, Ruplu. I'll take that. This is Al. Back to my comments on just the components really starting with gross margin and the fact that we would deem the more netted-down categories. Remember, cloud, security, Software as a Service as structural. And my comments there are more kind of over time, but also certainly thematically important in this environment. If you think about what we're talking about there, right? You got a lot of customers that are focused on how do I drive productivity, how do we get to the cloud, how do I reduce my costs. So thematically, structurally, we think there's durability there.  Same thing with services, right? Now we've bolstered and we've made significant investments on services. But also in times like this, this is where our customers look to us, they need assistance more so than ever. So those components really, really important. And then just look to the beyond the gross margin down to NGOI margin, it's important for us that we, just like our customers, remain very diligent and thoughtful about our spend, and we are on the pulse of our customers and what's happening and making sure that both the timing, the size and the criticality of our investments are always top of mind, and that's how we try to manage -- kind of manage the margin profile over time. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan Chase.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess for the first one, we've seen a few other enterprise suppliers report already. And I think in relation to sort of pulled back or a bit of a sort of pressure on customer budgets that's not as surprising to hear at this point. But they've also indicated a bit more pressure when it comes to the international markets, particularly EMEA.  I was just wondering, Chris, I mean, is there a difference you're seeing in terms of engagement with customers in the U.S. versus in the international markets? Is there a bit more of a pushback or a pullback in terms of thinking about budgets for next year in the international markets? Maybe your insights on that front will help. And I have a follow-up.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, sure. What I would say on that one is I focus in on the U.K., it's a pretty complex environment there right now for all the reasons we know. And I'd say a couple of things. First of all, our position in the market is very similar to CDW U.S. We've got the most broad-based portfolio of solutions and services capabilities. We have customers focusing on the same types of things: digital transformation, security, cloud, collaboration, et cetera. And also the criticality of technology is obviously central to companies and organizations over in the U.K.  That said, it is a tougher environment. And so I would just say that I attribute our ability to perform as well as we have been and in particular, this quarter, which was exceptional performance to the execution of the team and their ability to stay close to their customers, know what their customers need access, supply and provide the professional services at the front end for advice and counseling to ensure the highest return on technology investment. And that trusted adviser rule, you can never underestimate the impact that has on results in a market that is really in. It's very dynamic, I would say. So we expect them to continue to perform well despite the external factors.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And a follow-up, if I could get an update on the growth rate you're seeing or the growth trajectory you're seeing at Sirius and I know you mentioned sort of challenges around hiring talent at your customers, but what sort of constraints you might be having at the same time on Sirius and your ability to sort of scale that business? What are you trying to think about sort of how accretive it is to your out-performance to underlying industry growth, particularly as we start thinking about next year?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, sure. On the talent side, I would say, look, everybody is feeling tightness in the labor markets, but our position as the best place to work has been pretty solid for a very long time. And we have not seen length to fill or quality diminish at all. We've been very pleased with our ability to bring in talent. Part of that, I believe, is because it's a great place to work, but equally, the development of our technical talent in particular, is top of the list.  So if you even look this year at the number of certifications has increased dramatically, particularly around cloud services, for example, in security services. So CDW is a place to be if you're a technologist and that bodes well in the market. And as a result, obviously, we've been able to -- it's reflected in the performance. As a result, we've been able to help our customers with talent orchestration where they have talent scarcity and we've been able to staff professional services engagements at a very fast pace. So we're -- look, it's tough, it's a tough market, but we aren't inhibited by it right now, which is great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Cash at Raymond James.\nMark Cash: This is Mark on for Adam. It sounds like cloud and SaaS are doing very well for you and up by about 4Q. But assuming out of that, I think there's some earnings on the hyperscaler slowing down. Are you starting to see any of that impact to the pipeline? Or just the broad customer base, things like the strong digital transformation and security demand help keep you insulated from that somewhat?\nChristine Leahy: No, I think it could be a short answer. No, we aren't seeing that slowdown actually. We're seeing cloud continue to accelerate. And I don't need to take through all the reasons for you why that's happening. But look, with regard to our customers, we've got customers who are -- some are just starting the journey to the cloud. Some are on the journey. Some are trying to optimize the cloud. Some are moving optimized cloud and on-prem. And there's just a lot of opportunity to support customers in this journey. But we certainly are not seeing it start to slow down.\nMark Cash: Okay. Perfect. And then just a follow-up. I appreciate the update on the backlog you guys provided. Also wonder if you can update on what you're seeing around potential risk of double ordering and cancellations and a slowdown to the backlog.\nAlbert Miralles: Yes. Sure, Mark. We continue to not see any evidence of double ordering or canceling. So I would say that just the clarity and the commitment of our customers to the products they originally want and what we're delivering has been pretty solid, pretty seamless. So no concerns there.\nOperator: Our next question then comes from James Suva at Citigroup.\nJames Suva: Great. I had a question about higher labor rates, both on your cost of goods sold buying as well as your kind of OpEx line. Do the clients and customers kind of see it or notice it? Or is it just kind of all built-in? And are those creating a little bit more challenging thing for your customers? And then as we approach the end of this calendar year, can you remind us about like annual merit increases or anything like that on the OpEx line regarding higher wages and just cost of living adjustments and things like that?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, good question about labor because it's a pretty dynamic and fluid market. With regard to our own folks, remember that we are a highly variable compensation organization with a significant amount of compensation geared to performance. So that is a positive thing, and it doesn't really put as much pressure on kind of raising cost at the baseline level because there's opportunity on the upside with performance.  With regard to fees for professional services, for example, we do bring those up, like the rest of the industry in line with inflation. And that lags a little bit, right, when you bring it up because you got contracts in place. But so far, customers again, when it's a critical -- and it's a critical project, customers do not back at the expertise they need. It's just you've got your go-to trusted advisers and you're willing to pay for that because, look, there's pressure, and there's a lot at stake in getting the technology right.  In terms of our raises going into next year, performance raises, we're in the middle of evaluating that, and we'll know what we're doing when we get to next year.\nOperator: We have no further questions on the call. So I will hand back to Chris Leahy to conclude.\nChristine Leahy: Okay. Well, thank you, Seb. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our nearly 15,000 coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking with you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for dialing in. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Albert Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the third quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2022 outlook.  Turning to our third quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $6.2 billion, up 17.3% on a reported and an average daily-sales basis. On a constant-currency average daily-sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 18.7%. Sequentially, sales increased 1.1% versus the second quarter. Third quarter sales were in line with our expectations, reflecting broad-based and balanced growth across our portfolio.  On the supply side, some conditions improved during the quarter, resulting in an overall reduction in our backlog. While supply and lead times of client devices have indeed improved, pockets of pressure remain, especially in solution categories and our backlog remains very elevated. As we've previously shared, we would expect our backlog to feather out over time as supply conditions can begin to ease and this will not likely be symmetrical across product offerings. We continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers who is still uncertain about supply environment, and the team did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages to ensure strong returns on working capital.  We once again had an excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 34.8%. Gross profit margin was a record 19.8%, up 250 basis points versus last year. The expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, as we expected for the second half of the year, a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. The category grew nearly twice as fast as overall net sales, primarily driven by Software as a Service.  Second, product margins were strong, driven by both mix and demand for certain hardware products; and third, net sales contribution from high-margin services, which increased 70% year-over-year as a result of our recent acquisitions.  Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $684 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consisting with higher gross profit attainment and higher coworker count. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was nearly 15,000, up approximately 400 from the prior quarter, reflecting investments in coworkers that support high-growth solutions and services as well as our own digital transformation. Investments in our coworkers and in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are focused on disciplined and balanced investments that will pay dividends. This is evidenced by our record sales and profitability in the period.  GAAP operating income was $466 million, up 20.7% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $549 million, up 26.2%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 8.8%, up 60 basis points from the prior year and 40 basis points compared to the second quarter.  Overall, while we're very pleased with this outcome, it was above our expectations and driven by a confluence of factors within gross margin, including a favorable mix and rate of product margins, which we'd expect to moderate in Q4.  Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $63 million. Higher interest expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius as well as the effect of higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. This level of interest expense was in line with our expectation for the quarter. We have not changed our expectation of approximately $240 million for the full year.  Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 25.4%. This resulted in a third quarter tax expense of $101 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 60 basis points versus last year's rate as a result of an increase in nondeductible expenses and state taxes.  As you can see on Slide 13, the third quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.17. Our non-GAAP net income was $357 million in the quarter, up 20% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.60, up 22%.  Year-to-date results can be found on Slides 14 through 19. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $358 million and net debt was $5.8 billion. During the quarter, we reduced borrowings under a senior unsecured term loan by $400 million, consistent with our plan to reduce leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.5 billion.  Moving to Slide 21. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down 7 days from last year's third quarter and at the low end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting the impact of Sirius and our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management, along with strong growth in the business also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of over $1 billion, as shown on Slide 22.  For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital-allocation objectives, including returning $68 million to shareholders through dividends in addition to the $400 million in debt repayment, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 23.  Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income, including today's 18% increase to the dividend from $2 to $2.36 per share. The increased annual dividend represents approximately 25% of a trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income through September. The Q4 2022 dividend demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation in the business and marks the ninth consecutive year of increases since our initial public offering in 2013. Our dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 34% from its initial level. Going forward, we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings.  Second, we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3x. We ended the third quarter at 2.7x, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash generation. While we're at the middle of our targeted net leverage range, we are balancing rating agency capital expectations, which would call for us to be towards the bottom of our range. As such, we will continue to prioritize delevering until we are more firmly in our targeted net leverage range and can satisfy the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022.  And finally, while we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital-allocation objectives of M&A and share repurchases, we are firmly on the path to getting back to these priorities.  Moving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 24. While we're cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to execute, pivot to growth opportunities and outperform the broader market. We continue to expect the fourth quarter will reflect a greater mix in the netted-down revenues. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted-down revenues as a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins, all else equal.  With this in mind, we continue to expect U.S. market growth of 4% and now expect to be at the upper end of our 325 to 425 basis point range of CDW market out-performance in constant currency, on a combined basis. Recall, we previously shared, we would expect to be at the higher end of our premium range if supply improves. Conversely, if we experience elevated levels of supply constraints, or mix more into netted-down revenue streams, we would expect to be at the mid- to lower end of our premium range. On a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius.  On a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 18.5% growth in constant currency. The change in currency exchange rates from our initial original outlook is now expected to be a headwind of $110 million to net sales in the fourth quarter and $260 million for the full year. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.13 to the British pound and $0.73 for the Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter.  Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. This implies the fourth quarter will be the fourth consecutive quarter of 20% or higher operating profit growth. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to approximately 23.5% full year growth in constant currency on a reported basis.  I would remind you that 2021 would have been $8.49 per share on a full year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97 per share, which included only 1 month of Sirius. The change in currency exchange rates from our original outlook is now expected to be a headwind of -- to EPS of $0.04 in the fourth quarter and $0.08 for the full year. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant-currency basis.  Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter, related to average daily sales, we expect a 0 to low single-digit sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. This equates to 9.75% to 10.75% year-over-year reported net sales growth rate for the fourth quarter. We anticipate continued strong gross profit margin and NGOI margin in the fourth quarter at or above year-to-date average levels for both, reflecting some moderation from what we experienced in Q3. And we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the range of 18.25% and 19.25% year-over-year on a reported basis.  Finally, we now expect full year free cash flow to be approximately 5% of net sales, exceeding the top end of our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter and across years. If you recall, 2021 free cash flow was 2.3% of net sales. In aggregate, we expect our 2021 and 2022 free cash flow to balance out and be within our free cash flow rule of thumb over the 2 years.  That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on future earnings calls.  And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to 1 with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yes. Shannon, this is Al. So happy to address that. So as I mentioned, the NGOI margin and dollar result was largely driven by strong gross margin. So if we just take the components of gross margin for the quarter, a few things, Shannon, that I would note first, obviously, the benefit and accretive effect from Sirius which we've seen all year.  Number two, the effect of netted-down revenues, right, largely driven by focus on security, cloud, Software as a Service. We would view that component as pretty structural.  Next, I would say, contributions from services. Again, we've made a lot of investments in that space. So we view that as largely structural. And then the last component of our gross margin, Shannon, would be on the product side. And we've talked about through the year that we've had really favorable, both mix and rate on the product side. And that would be the 1 variable that we would see potentially could moderate. And so obviously, in this supply environment, we've seen our customers favor a bit more speed over price. And that's led to a favorable mix and also strong rates. And so obviously, as we start to see supply ease a bit here, you could see that moderate, and that's what we're tending towards for Q4. Yes. Amit, this is Al. So similar to my response to Shannon there, really, if you tick down the list, again, the kind of the priority order of what contributed in gross margin, Sirius for sure, netted-down revenue, contributions from services and then on the product side. And I would say that both the netted down and the contributions from services would be deemed a bit more structural. Certainly, from a product margin perspective, there's a structural component, but you're going to vary depending on mix in any given period. And so that's what we've been seeing.  To your question on guiding on gross profit, that's certainly something, Amit, that we talk about. Just remember beauty of our deep and broad portfolio means at any given time, you're going to have puts and takes in terms of where things show up and what our customers need. And so what we discussed really there is there are going to be periods where there's stronger hardware contribution and refreshes and those types of things. And that's where certainly focusing on the net sales is important as well. But as time goes by, and particularly as we see some of the supply conditions change, certainly, we'll talk more about kind of the contribution of gross profit and how we think about that from an outlook perspective. Yes, sure. Thanks, Erik. So look, I would say Q4, I think, is going to be a decent reflection of what we've seen year-to-date, which has been really strong margins, both gross margins and NGOI. Q3 was exceptional. And I think I've called out some of the areas that really drove that, particularly on the product margin side. So I would say it's stay the course pretty much on par with what we've seen for the year, notwithstanding that, again, as we start to see this feathering out of supply, it's conceivable you could see a bit of a moderation on the product margin side. So that's basically been what you've seen year-to-date is low 19s on gross margin and low 8s on NGOI margin may be slightly better. Yes, Keith, I'll take that. So I would -- it varies by channel and obviously varies by products. Certainly, there are pockets where we've had very solid unit growth. And then in some cases where net sales is more bolstered by ASP. And so that's going to vary by channel and by product.  But back to Chris' point, I would say, for the quarter and what we see now, ASPs continue to be firm. But we're certainly cognizant as supply changes, potentially some customer behaviors change, you could maybe see a bit of that easing of that, and that's why we're just being a little bit prudent on the product margin side. Sure, Ruplu. I'll take that. This is Al. Back to my comments on just the components really starting with gross margin and the fact that we would deem the more netted-down categories. Remember, cloud, security, Software as a Service as structural. And my comments there are more kind of over time, but also certainly thematically important in this environment. If you think about what we're talking about there, right? You got a lot of customers that are focused on how do I drive productivity, how do we get to the cloud, how do I reduce my costs.

So hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. Sure, Mark. We continue to not see any evidence of double ordering or canceling. So I would say that just the clarity and the commitment of our customers to the products they originally want and what we're delivering has been pretty solid, pretty seamless. So no concerns there."

            "name": "Christine Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results and then provide an update on our strategic progress and a summary of our outlook. Al will provide additional details on the financials and outlook as well as our capital-allocation priorities. And then we'll move right to your questions.  We had an outstanding third quarter. Once again, we delivered all-time record sales, profits and margins. Net sales were $6.2 billion, 17% higher than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $449 million, up 26%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.60, up 22% year-over-year. This exceptional performance is a result of our relentless execution and disciplined investment in our customer-centric strategy, a strategy that underpins our ability to address customer priorities across a broad array of end markets with solutions across the full stack and full life cycle of IT.  The vital need for interconnected and integrated solutions has created levels of complexity never seen before. We cut through the complexity and help customers maximize the impact of technology, technology that delivers mission-critical outcomes.  In today's environment of persistent uncertainty, our customers are increasingly leaning on CDW as a trusted partner, and they look to us to provide unbiased expert advice across the entire spectrum of IT. A trusted partner who helps them tackle their most pressing priorities, pressing priorities like advancing their digital transformation, driving innovation and delivering exceptional stakeholder experiences, along with enhancing security and supporting collaboration in today's distributed environment of work, learn and live everywhere. Priorities that deliver operating efficiency and expense elasticity like burstable billing and modern hybrid and multi-cloud environments and infrastructure and new technology investments to optimize flexibility and agility. Our ability to enable solutions in support of all these diverse priorities drove broad-based and balanced performance.  There were 3 main drivers of our results: our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio and the relentless execution of our 3-part strategy. First, the breadth and diversity of our customer end markets. As you know, we have 5 U.S. sales channels: corporate; small business; health care; government; and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $2 billion to over $10 billion over the last 12 months. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals.  We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of USD 2.9 billion. Our portfolio approach enables us to toggle to the best pockets of opportunity and to be there for our customers along every step of their IT journeys. Our collective team did an exceptional job this quarter. Our corporate team delivered another stellar quarter with a 25% net sales increase. Results were balanced and broad-based. Customers continued to focus on digital transformation through infrastructure modernization and process automation. The team's ability to deliver these outcomes translated to excellent solutions growth led by NetComm, Enterprise Storage and Cloud.  Both professional and managed services posted double-digit increases as the team helped customers achieve their IT priorities by augmenting their technology capabilities with dedicated technologists. The hybrid work environment continues to thrive with continued customer focus on collaboration across workspaces and continued need to modernize their employee experience.  Small business delivered growth for the seventh straight quarter, a 5% increase on top of last year's 39% growth. The team continued to help small business customers navigate the impact of technology across all aspects of their business into today's cautious environment and accomplish critical projects that enhance and sustain mission and business outcomes. This drove double-digit performance across software, security and cloud. Our full stack, full life cycle support for customers, which enables us to nimbly shift towards solutions that maximize prior investments led to double-digit performance in services.  Public posted a strong 13% increase this quarter. The health care team delivered another excellent quarter of robust growth, up 28%. Once again, results were driven by the team's ability to help health care organizations harness technology to drive productivity in an environment of rising costs. Our health care customers are increasingly relying on CDW for talent orchestration and to guide their implementations of cloud resources. Health care organizations face complex business dynamics, but they are committed to mission-critical projects and data center and collaboration modernization continues to move forward.  Government posted 38% growth. Within government, state and local posted a substantial double-digit increase. Our collaboration with customers to identify and capture various funding opportunities is bearing fruit with data center and software projects beginning to advance under multiyear phrasing. The team delivered excellent security results as they help state and local municipalities enhance their defenses against emerging and evolving cyber threats. Remote collaboration continues as a top priority, driving excellent performance across transactional product categories.  As expected, federal activity resumed in earnest. Seasonal spending patterns normalized with the September fiscal year-end spending uptick. The team helps customers address their top priorities, including upgrades to collaboration and data management infrastructure. This drove strong growth in nearly all categories compared to last year.  For education, higher ed growth was more than offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall sales decreased 7.5%. The higher-ed team continued to deliver student success programs to institutions. These programs promote enrollment through comprehensive endpoint solutions and improved campus connectivity and safety and drive client devices sales and NetComm growth.  Security remains very -- security demands were high, driven by solutions that addressed ransomware and hacking threats through CDW-delivered security enhancements. K-12 performance remains strong on an absolute basis, but was obscured by the team's exceptional client device driven success in 2021. Today, the team is helping school systems determine how to sustain prior IT investments and maintain the learning opportunities provided by digital equity initiatives. At the same time, the team continues to help customers implement industry-leading innovative connective learning spaces as well as enhanced campus safety. And this drove strong security and audio-visual performance during the quarter.  Other, our combined U.K. and Canada results increased 18% on a reported basis. Both regions delivered excellent local market growth. The U.K.'s performance was broad-based and balanced as our team showed resolved and resiliency in a complex environment. Canada's performance was also broad-based and balanced with customer priorities similar to the U.S. amid a continued shift into solutions and services.  All in, the teams delivered another excellent quarter of end-market performance. Our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and a driver of our differentiated performance.  The second driver of our portfolio -- of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio. As technology has become a more vital part of their strategies, customers require comprehensive, integrated and interconnected solutions and services. Our ability to address these priorities across the entire IT continuum delivered double-digit growth across our solutions portfolio.  U.S. hardware increased 13%. This steady performance was on top of 2021 [Technical Difficulty] quarter double-digit hardware growth. Network modernization and upgrades drove double-digit increases in Enterprise Storage and NetComm. Video and audio and servers increased healthy single-digit rates.  Commercial PC performance was strong on a relative basis and even more so when we exclude the year-over-year impact of growth from the K-12 market. Relative to the supply environment, conditions improved across several transactional areas. Despite these improvements during the quarter, our overall backlog remains elevated. We expect the backlog to continue to feather out over the coming quarters. U.S. software increased double digits. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environment with strong double-digit increases in storage management, application suites and database management. Cloud was an important driver of performance across the business. Complexity surrounding cloud has not changed and navigating between multiple options remains a major area of customer focus. Once again, cloud was a meaningful contributor to profitability with both customer spend and gross profit up by double digits.  Infrastructure as a Service, productivity, security, application delivery and connectivity were key cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase. Our teams continue to guide customers through a cohesive strategy of security assessment, data protection and threat mitigation to improve their security frameworks and respond to increasing threats. This drove strong double-digit growth in customer spend.  U.S. services performance continued to advance this quarter. Customers are leaning into CDW as extensions of their own teams and leveraging CDW services as part of their strategies. This produced broad-based and balanced growth driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. Services net sales were roughly twice last year's levels and represented 8% of total sales, up from 5% in 2021. Services are fundamental to our go-to-market approach and are a key enabler of our value proposition.  To support this, we have been making organic and inorganic investments in services over the past several years and those investments quickly gained traction in the market.  And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our 3-part growth strategy. Our targeted investments are guided by our 3-part strategy, which is: one, to capture share and acquire new customers; two, to enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions areas; and three, to expand services capabilities. This strategy delivers on our commitments to our customers and drives both our top line and bottom-line performance. Over the past 3 years, we have enhanced our relevance to customers by broadening and deepening our capabilities, including in automation, cloud-native and DevOps and cybersecurity. Capabilities necessary to ensure we remain the trusted adviser to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformations. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers across physical, digital and cloud-based environments in the U.S. and internationally.  A great example of how our services investments deepen relationships and strengthen the value we deliver to customers is a solution we are delivering to a medium-sized hospital system. With 3 primary hospitals and approximately 70 regional clinics and urgent care facilities, the system was challenged to find, retain and train a sustainable level of technical staff. Having previously worked with them, providing both hardware solutions and professional services to re-architect their disaster-recovery solution, we had a deep understanding of our customers' environment.  We coupled with the breadth and depth of our services offering, this enabled us to construct a new design, build, run end-to-end services solution that leverages CDW managed services and talent orchestration capabilities. A solution made possible by the services investments we have made and the technical mastery we've accelerated over recent years, mastery over the broad spectrum of technologies the customer needed for support, including Windows and Linux servers, virtualization, storage, backup and recovery, databases, switching, routing, network access and cloud-based productivity and identity-management tools, our full portfolio of services enabled us to become an extension of the customer's team.  We recently went live under a 5-year contract with monthly recurring revenue in the hundreds of thousands and a total contract value over $10 million. A great example of how our investment and services deliver value to our customers and cause them to lean further into CDW.  Investments in our customer-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our team's terrific execution and relentless focus on our customers delivered significant out-performance to our baseline 2022 outlook. When combined with our current expectations for fourth quarter performance, we now expect to outperform the U.S. IT market at the high end of the 325 to 425 basis points range. Our estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2022 remains 4%.  Taken together, this equates to year-over-year constant-currency growth at the high end of the 7.25% to 8.25% range. The high end of the range is applied to the combined CDW 2021 revenues of $22.8 billion, calculated as though Sirius was acquired on January 1, 2021, instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1. On a reported basis, this equates to a constant-currency increase of 18.5% over 2020 results.  Our outlook continues to reflect our baseline expectations that our mix will remain weighted more heavily to netted-down items. We expect this to drive profit growth faster than sales growth, while we continue to thoughtfully invest in our future. We are cognizant of the current environment, but to date, customer urgency to innovate for the future and the internal and external stakeholder demand has not diminished. Of course, we remain mindful of wildcards, including economic, geopolitical and the variable nature of the supply chain, and we will keep a watchful eye on these and other potential factors. As we always do, we will provide an updated view on business conditions and our annual outlook on our next call.  In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Our flexible business model and proven formula for success will continue to serve us well. The accelerated pace of change makes our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers, more important now than ever.  Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Shannon, it's Chris. I'll give you some color maybe on the overall PC trends we're seeing. And as expected, overall, the PC environment has moderated a bit versus the robust client device growth in 2021. But that said, our end markets are not synchronized. So looking at the client-device growth across channels, for example, we helped customers with pent-up demand in our government segment in both federal and state and local.  Obviously, K-12 was down as expected, but our other segments, Commercial Healthcare, higher-ed channels, what they saw was upgrade experience, not right now a broad refresh but upgrading of experience, meaning higher-value PCs along with the collaboration tools and automation that helps with that experience.  What I would say is, I can't tell you exactly which channels are going to start picking up their client devices soon, but we are continuing to see the criticality of client devices [Technical Difficulty]. And so at the end of the day, we'll continue to profitably outperform the PC market for several reasons. Number one, as we've said before, there's a very compelling commercial PC opportunity. When you think about the value PCs deliver -- so employee productivity, for example, and use cases and also PC product cycle. We're already seeing some customers who are moving to Windows 11, a number of customers moving to Windows 11, particularly for things like security updates.  And then the natural refresh. We've talked a lot about the aging of devices from 2018, '19, '20, and we'll see those refreshes start to kick in. The other thing is think about the services that CDW wraps around PCs, which are very attractive to our customers. There are massive market opportunity available to us, addressable market opportunities when we think about cross-selling to our Sirius customers and also international.  And then the thing I finally say is that CDW has got the absolute best PC muscle in infrastructure, which has allowed us to outperform the market significantly in the past. And remember, when our partners are looking to move the needle in any arena, they look to CDW to help them do that. So very confident PCs are critical to the future, moderated a bit, but still fundamentally part of the solution customers are looking for.  What I would say is right now, in terms of prioritizing, our customers are largely leaning into their infrastructure, the things that they had not invested in over the last couple of years, so infrastructure, cloud, security, things like that and priority and PCs are a little lower on the priority list. Amit, it's Chris. On small business, it's been interesting. I would just start with the execution from the team. It's a cautious environment for sure, but the team is really helping customers navigate what's become ubiquitous impacts of technology across literally every aspect of their business. And in the small-business arena, like all of our customers right now, there's a focus on mission-critical priorities. And that tends to be software, cloud and security led. And so CDW, with the capabilities we've built within that segment, you'll recall we separated it out about 4, 5 years ago, we bring the full stack, full life cycle support for customers. And we've been able to, over the past several quarters, really nimbly shift towards the solutions that maximize their prior investments and add services to the mix there.  So look, we continue to see momentum behind the strategic execution in small business, and we're really confident in our ability to leverage our broad-solution portfolio and pivot where the customers need us. And that right now is infrastructure solution and modernizing and optimizing and securing their networks.  What I would say also is this notion that technology has become more critical to business strategy is the same in small businesses. It's really no difference there. So thematically, customers are very much prioritizing their technology investments. And while there's pressure on budgets for sure, and customers are being prudent, technology is getting a priority. So the pulse of our customers is pretty strong right now, and we're just staying very close to them in what's top of mind. Yes. Sure, Erik. Here's what I'd say between the 2 calls. And it's the words I just used before, where there's certainly, I'd say, incrementally more pressure on budgets generally for our customers. Look, there's persistent uncertainty out there. And when that happens, there's just pressure. That said, customers are being prudent and what we are seeing consistently is notwithstanding that added scrutiny. Technology is being prioritized because it's reframed from a cost center to an asset of innovation, an enabler of cost efficiency and agility and risk mitigation and resilience and experience. So technology touches everything that drives competitive advantage for our customers. Further, we are continuing to see a scarcity of talent in the market, coupled with the heightened complexity that technology brings and security risks continue to essentially explode. So you have all of that happening in a more pressured budget environment.  The good news for CDW is in those environments, our customers lean even more into CDW. And so the strategy that we've been executing with discipline over the last few years, has created -- has really strengthened our value prop. I would say our value proposition and the broad-based portfolio, particularly of solutions and services has never been stronger. It's never been more relevant. It's never been more resonant with our customers and they can look to us to help them make the best decisions in an unbiased outcome-based way. So I guess the point is more pressure right now, persistent uncertainty, but that actually drives the need for CDW even more. Keith, it's Chris. Yes, I would say on the price increases, first of all, the ubiquitous across the industry. We haven't seen them abate really. We have been able to pass them along. And right now, given the continued supply constraints and the prioritization of technology, we're not expecting to see those abate anytime soon because customers are okay taking those on. We might start to see that sometime in 2023. But for right now, they're holding strong. Ruplu, we can't hear you. Not quite. Yes. Perfect. Thank you. Yes, Ruplu, I would tell you that it is more mix than demand generated. Really, as we had expected, we have mixed more heavily into netted-down items, even a little bit more than we expected, and that really is the main driver of the pressure on the top line. And that's -- from a deceleration perspective, like I said before, there's pressure. PCs have moderated, as we said. But really, otherwise, we're seeing what I would consider pretty robust demand and performance as a result. Yes, sure. What I would say on that one is I focus in on the U.K., it's a pretty complex environment there right now for all the reasons we know. And I'd say a couple of things. First of all, our position in the market is very similar to CDW U.S. We've got the most broad-based portfolio of solutions and services capabilities. We have customers focusing on the same types of things: digital transformation, security, cloud, collaboration, et cetera. And also the criticality of technology is obviously central to companies and organizations over in the U.K.  That said, it is a tougher environment. And so I would just say that I attribute our ability to perform as well as we have been and in particular, this quarter, which was exceptional performance to the execution of the team and their ability to stay close to their customers, know what their customers need access, supply and provide the professional services at the front end for advice and counseling to ensure the highest return on technology investment. And that trusted adviser rule, you can never underestimate the impact that has on results in a market that is really in. It's very dynamic, I would say. So we expect them to continue to perform well despite the external factors. Yes, sure. On the talent side, I would say, look, everybody is feeling tightness in the labor markets, but our position as the best place to work has been pretty solid for a very long time. And we have not seen length to fill or quality diminish at all. We've been very pleased with our ability to bring in talent. Part of that, I believe, is because it's a great place to work, but equally, the development of our technical talent in particular, is top of the list.  So if you even look this year at the number of certifications has increased dramatically, particularly around cloud services, for example, in security services. So CDW is a place to be if you're a technologist and that bodes well in the market. And as a result, obviously, we've been able to -- it's reflected in the performance. As a result, we've been able to help our customers with talent orchestration where they have talent scarcity and we've been able to staff professional services engagements at a very fast pace. So we're -- look, it's tough, it's a tough market, but we aren't inhibited by it right now, which is great. No, I think it could be a short answer. No, we aren't seeing that slowdown actually. We're seeing cloud continue to accelerate. And I don't need to take through all the reasons for you why that's happening. But look, with regard to our customers, we've got customers who are -- some are just starting the journey to the cloud. Some are on the journey. Some are trying to optimize the cloud. Some are moving optimized cloud and on-prem. And there's just a lot of opportunity to support customers in this journey. But we certainly are not seeing it start to slow down. Yes, good question about labor because it's a pretty dynamic and fluid market. With regard to our own folks, remember that we are a highly variable compensation organization with a significant amount of compensation geared to performance. So that is a positive thing, and it doesn't really put as much pressure on kind of raising cost at the baseline level because there's opportunity on the upside with performance.  With regard to fees for professional services, for example, we do bring those up, like the rest of the industry in line with inflation. And that lags a little bit, right, when you bring it up because you got contracts in place. But so far, customers again, when it's a critical -- and it's a critical project, customers do not back at the expertise they need. It's just you've got your go-to trusted advisers and you're willing to pay for that because, look, there's pressure, and there's a lot at stake in getting the technology right.  In terms of our raises going into next year, performance raises, we're in the middle of evaluating that, and we'll know what we're doing when we get to next year. Okay. Well, thank you, Seb. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our nearly 15,000 coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking with you next quarter."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results, strategic progress and outlook, and then Al will run through the financials and our capital allocation priorities. And then we will move right to your questions. We had an exceptional second quarter. The teams continued to execute well in a challenging supply environment and delivered all time record sales, margins and profits. For the second quarter, net sales were $6.1 billion, 19% higher than last year and our first $6 billion quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $516 million, up 23% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.49 also up 23% year-over-year. These exceptional results reflect our ability to address customers' priorities across a broad array of end markets with solutions across the full spectrum of IT. Digital transformation, agility and security remain top priorities with ongoing focus on hybrid work and return to office driving collaboration, networking and endpoint solutions. Customers also continue to seek ways to manage costs while meeting or exceeding coworker and customer service level requirements. Our ability to meet all of these needs led to a broad-based and balanced performance and was a result of three key drivers. Number one, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets; number two, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio; and number three, our ongoing execution against our customer-centric strategy. Let's take a look at how each contributed to our growth this quarter. First, the breadth and diversity of our customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $8 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of US$2.6 billion. This portfolio approach enables us to toggle to the best pockets of opportunity. Each team did an exceptional job this quarter. Our corporate team delivered another record quarter with a 34% net sales increase. Results were balanced and broad-based. Customers continue to invest to stay ahead of the curve, to either begin or advance their efforts to address the accelerating pace of change. Digital transformation drove excellent solutions growth with strong double-digit increases in NetComm, servers, collaboration, cloud and software. Customers are increasingly seeking our advice and expertise in navigating their IT journeys, and this drove strong performance in professional and managed services and warranties. At the same time, corporate customers continue to turn to us to meet their needs for hybrid and return to office solutions. And the team delivered another quarter of double-digit client device growth, reflecting both unit and ASP increases. Small business performance was in line with our expectations and the team delivered a 4% increase on top of last year's 60% growth. This net sales growth understates demand as customers prioritize cloud and software solutions, which are accounted for on a netted down basis. A better barometer of customer demand in the quarter is the gross profit performance of small business, which increased at more than twice the rate of sales growth. During the quarter, customer spend increased more than 20% for both security and cloud as customers modernize, optimize and secure the applications running on their endpoint devices. Infrastructure spending is the natural follow-on from remote enablement and return to office demand. Remote enablement remains strong and the team produced another quarter of double-digit collaboration and client device growth. Public posted an 8% increase this quarter. The healthcare team delivered another excellent quarter, up 30%. We continue to help our hospital systems and healthcare organizations leverage technology to mitigate staffing shortages and wage and cost inflation. A great example of this is seamless patient intake and record keeping solutions that use biometric security to improve emergency department throughput. And while healthcare has taken a more cautious view toward cloud in the past, the benefits of flexibility and reduced IT support burden are compelling more customers to adopt cloud-based solutions, driving a double-digit increase in cloud customer spend. Government posted 19% growth. State and local performance reflected continued success helping customers maximize the value of their IT investments, leveraging our expertise in professional and managed services. At the same time, the team is helping customers navigate through the complexities of funding programs and the impact on their long-term planning efforts. While customers generally have until 2024 to 2025 to spend stimulus, data continues to proliferate and we delivered excellent cloud and storage performance. Remote collaboration continues to be a priority driving double-digit growth in devices and audio/video. As we expected, federal return to growth in the quarter. Federal customers prioritized services tied to solution inception and ongoing management. Similar to state and local, remote collaboration led to double-digit transactions growth. After the past two years of unusual spending patterns, we anticipate a return to more normal season patterns for federal, including fiscal year-end September budget activity. Higher ed's strong performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall education sales decreased 6% off of last year's excellent second quarter performance. The higher ed team continues to help universities enable student success and student access programs using technology to give institutions an enrollment edge. This includes deploying comprehensive endpoint solutions, security and campus connectivity to deliver enhanced dorm room experience. K-12 posted a healthy seasonal increase, but remained below last year's exceptional stimulus-driven results. During the quarter, a third wave of Emergency Connectivity Funding, ECF was announced, which opened July 1 and extends through December 2023, adding complexity to an already broader way of funding. We continue to work with school systems to help identify how to maximize available funding to maintain equity and access IT advancements into the future. In the near-term, the team also continues to help educators implement connected learning spaces and to enhance security. Other our combined UK and Canada results increased 24% on a reported basis. Both regions delivered excellent growth. UK was up significantly in local currency and delivered balance growth across both public and commercial with excellent remote enablement activity. Canada increased double digits in local currency, primarily driven by commercial customers with excellent solutions growth. The second driver of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio. Our ability to address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum resulted in excellent performance across our solutions and transactions portfolios. Solutions grew twice as fast as transactions. U.S. hardware increased low-double digits. Growth was broad-based and included double-digit increases in server and server management and video/audio. We also continue to see underlying strength in notebooks across our commercial business. Client devices, NetComm, enterprise storage and printing and scanning increased at a healthy single-digit rate. This exceptional performance was on top of 2021 second quarter double-digit hardware growth. Demand continued to outpace supply in several key areas, notably in networking and enterprise storage. Customers, once again, placed orders to get in line for second half 2022 projects, especially in NetComm. While overall backlog ticked down slightly from last quarter, we exited the quarter with backlog at nearly twice last year's second quarter level and once again, we leveraged our competitive advantages, including our distribution centers, our extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and our strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate an ongoing supply challenge. U.S. software increased nearly 40% compared to the prior year. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environments with strong double-digit increases in storage and network management software, application suites and security software. Cloud was an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to profitability with customer spend and gross profit increasing by double digits. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, productivity, security, application delivery and connectivity were key growth workloads during the period. U.S. services performance was excellent this quarter. Growth was broad-based and balanced, driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. Services net sales were roughly twice last year's level and represented 8% of total sales up from 5% in 2021 and 2020. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, our customer and coworker-centric strategy. Over the past three years, we have relentlessly focused on executing our strategy to enhance our high relevance and high growth solutions and services fueled by organic and inorganic investments. Eight acquisitions have deepened and advanced our services capabilities, including automation, cloud-native and DevOps and cybersecurity. Capabilities necessary to ensure, we remain the trusted advisor to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers, whether in a physical, digital or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally. Through our acquisitions, we welcomed nearly 3,000 new coworkers with more than half in technical roles. Since year-end 2018, our technical team has doubled in size. Today, more than 5,400 presales specialists and engineers work alongside our world-class sellers to deliver the complex digital transformation solutions from code to cloud and data center to database that our customers want and need. All of our investments, whether homegrown or acquired are designed to maximize our key points of differentiation in the marketplace and ensure we continue to help customers achieve the outcomes they need from technology, so they can do great things. Let me share a couple of recent examples that demonstrate how our investments are making a difference for customers. In the federal space, the power of bringing three winning teams from CDW, Sirius and Focal Point together is evident in the cybersecurity solutions we are delivering to the intelligence community. Together, the focus is on enhancing our scope across the Department of Defense and civilian agencies. To gain traction in this space, you must deliver proof-of-concept, which we do with our dedicated advanced solutions lab. You must provide training and support and you need agency to agency endorsement. While the CDW government team already had both expertise and scale, Sirius federal team brings a track record of success and solution configuration, technical integration and managed services. And our cyber experts at Focal Point Academy deliver the professional training these agencies need. Our relevance to federal customers has never been greater. The second example of how our investments enable customers to achieve great outcomes comes from our small business team. A provider of software-as-a-service solutions to pharmaceutical and life sciences companies needed to address their aging data center infrastructure. Their customers' workloads and data were being run on servers that were well beyond end of life. The servers clearly were not capable of supporting their existing business, let alone growing their SaaS offerings. The CTO initiated a competitive bidding process for a very small scale professional services contract to provide proof-of-concept on cloud migrations starting with a couple dozen servers. CDW and our competitors all utilize the same public cloud provider, but CDW1 based on our experience with migrations are proven post-migration support and our longstanding trusted relationship with the customer serving their transactional product needs. The CDW team bolstered by technical support from our IGNW, Digital Velocity Professional Services team built a secure landing zone in the public cloud and the proof-of-concept proved so successful. The customer is now migrating hundreds of servers. Seeing the huge burden, CDW lifted off the customer's engineering team who are having trouble balancing their day-to-day operations while trying to expand their cloud footprint. The customer contracted CDW for ongoing managed services of their rapidly growing cloud environment. The current annual services opportunity is at $750,000 run rate and is on a path to $1.5 million. By staying close to the customer, CDW, once again, had the opportunity to help make IT work, allowing the customer to improve the scalability and performance of their software offering. Investments in our customer and coworker-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our team's terrific execution and relentless focus on the customer, delivered significant outperformance to our baseline outlook in the first half of 2022. Given this excellent performance, we continue to expect to outperform the U.S. IT market by 325 basis points to 425 basis points, 125 basis points higher than both our long-term average level of outperformance and our original view at the end of year 2021. Our estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2022 remains 4%. Taken together, this equates to constant currency growth of 7.25% to 8.25% above 2021 combined CDW revenues of $22.8 billion. Recall, 2021 combined CDW is calculated as though Sirius was acquired on January 1, 2021 instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1. On a reported basis, our outlook represents a 17.5% to 18.5% increase over 2021 results on a constant currency basis. Our outlook continues to reflect our baseline expectations that we will mix into more sales of solutions in the back half of the year, notably cloud and security. Given this expected change in second half mix, we also expect to deliver profit growth faster than sales growth even as we continue to invest in our future. Our outlook also continues to reflect our expectations that supply constraints remain relatively consistent with the first half of the year. While we are cognizant of economic headlines, to-date, we have not seen a change in behavior that would impact our view on the second half of the year. Of course, we remain mindful of economic risks as well as other wild cards, including the potential for further disruption to supply and changes resulting from COVID incidence rates. We will keep a watchful eye as always on these and other potential issues. And as we always do, we will provide an updated view on customer activity and our annual outlook on the next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out execute competition. We will also continue to invest to ensure we are remaining our customers trusted technology partner of choice, helping them deliver the business outcomes they need. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more details on our financials and outlook. Al?\nAlbert Miralles: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2022 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $6.1 billion, up 19.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 20.5%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 1.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were in line with our expectations, reflecting broad-based and balanced growth across our portfolio. On the supply side, consistent with last quarter, we saw pockets of improvement and pockets of pressure. The change in our overall backlog compared to the first quarter was insignificant. Year-over-year, our backlog remains elevated in both transactional and solution categories, and we continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers through this uncertain supply environment. The team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages to ensure strong returns on working capital. We had excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 32.3%. Gross profit margin was a record 19%, up 180 basis points versus last year. The expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, increased netted down revenues, primarily within Software-as-a-Service as the category continued to grow faster than overall net sales. Netted down revenues represented 28% of total gross profit; second, product margins were strong, driven by both mix and resilient demand for certain hardware products; and third, net sales and high-margin professional service business nearly doubled as a result of our recent acquisition. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $652 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consistent with higher gross profit and higher coworker count. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was nearly 14,600, up roughly 3,900 from the prior year quarter, reflecting organic and inorganic investments in coworkers that support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. Investment in our coworkers and in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are seeing our disciplined and balanced investments pay dividends as evidenced by record sales and profitability in the period. GAAP operating income was $435 million, up 17.7%. Non-GAAP operating income was $516 million, up 23.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 8.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and 60 basis points from Q1. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $58 million. Higher interest expense is primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius as well as higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $98 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 50 basis points versus last year as a result of an increase in nondeductible expenses. As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per share was $2.04. Our non-GAAP net income was $340 million in the quarter, up 19%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.49, up 23% from last year. Year-to-date results can be found on Slides 14 through 19. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $542 million and net debt was $6 billion. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Moving to Slide 20. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down two days from last year's second quarter and reflecting a tighter spread between DSO and DPO. Year-to-date free cash flow was $717 million, as shown on Slide 21. This is higher than a typical first half, reflecting strong growth in the business and effective working capital management. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives, including returning $68 million to shareholders through dividends and further reducing our net leverage ratio, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 22. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the quarter at 2.9x, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash generation. And while we are at the top of our targeted net leverage range, we are balancing rating agency capital expectations, which would call for us to be towards the bottom of our range. As such, we will continue to prioritize delevering until we are more firmly in our targeted net leverage range and can satisfy the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022. And while we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priority of M&A and share repurchases, we are firmly on a path to getting back to delivering on these priorities. Moving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 23, starting with sales. Our outlook remains unchanged from last quarter on a constant currency basis, including holding our second half outlook at our initial aggressive baseline. While we are cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we are confident in our ability to execute, pivot to where the growth opportunities are and outperform the broader market. We continue to expect the back half of the year will reflect a greater mix in a netted down revenues as we overlap 2021's strong client device sales. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted down revenues has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars, but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margin, all else equal. With that in mind, our outlook for full-year 2022 continues to be U.S. IT market growth of 4% plus 325 basis points to 425 basis points of CDW outperformance in constant currency on a combined basis. Recall that, on a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius. On a reported basis, our full-year net sales outlook equates to approximately 17.5% to 18.5% growth in constant currency. Currency is expected to be a headwind of approximately $120 million to net sales in the second half of the year. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.22 to the British pound and $0.78 for the Canadian dollar in the second half. Our baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we have been experiencing. We would expect to be at the lower end of our premium range if we mix more into netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experience elevated levels of supply constraints. We would be at the higher end if hardware growth is stronger or if supply improves. Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. For non-GAAP earnings per share, recall that 2021 would have been $8.49 on a full-year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97, which included only one month of Sirius. We now expect full-year non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid-teens, call it 14% to 15% in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to a low 20% full-year growth rate in constant currency on a reported basis. Currency is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.04 to earnings per share in the second half of the year based on the reference exchange rates. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. We expect a low single-digit increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis. This equates to a roughly 17% year-over-year reported net sales growth rate for the third quarter. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than reported net sales. Finally, we now expect to be towards the top-end of our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales in 2022, assuming current tax rates. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik, please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Chris, you mentioned you haven't really seen any impact of the macro on your business yet and you continue to monitor it closely. Maybe if I can ask it another way, when you sort of interact with your customers, and we know a lot of the enterprises are starting to slow down their own hiring plans. Are you seeing a greater sort of intent in relying on CDW and your service capabilities as we head into sort of the next year just on account of them slowing down their plans in terms of hiring engineering resources, et cetera? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Good morning, Samik. Thanks for the question. And I would say just the short answer is yes. We are seeing our customers rely more heavily on us in the labor shortage world we're in. We've said often that technology has become just absolutely essential, more integral to our customers' success and more vital to their businesses, whether it is delivering experience, whether it is profitability, whether it's teaching kids, whether it's providing health care. It is just essential to what organizations do, and CDW is their trusted adviser. And we are continuing to see our customers lean into us more for some of the things that we referenced in our prepared remarks, for example, advisory services on the front-end professional services as they're going through their disciplined planning, et cetera. But equally, relieving their staffs of important management, like data center security and things like that. So it's been a very positive move for us and is driving some of our growth.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. And for my follow-up, if I can just ask you on the supply chain. I know your guidance or outperformance is based on certain sort of improvements in supply chain that could potentially happen. But as we talk to a lot of the OEMs, clearly, we're seeing signs of them expecting more availability of components. Where are things in relation to lead times that are communicated to you? Or sort of what are you seeing in terms of lead times? And are you expecting things to get better? Or are you sort of not really seeing much change yet in communication from the OEMs themselves?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, I'll start with that. Al can add, if you'd like. I would tell you that \u2013 look, we don't expect supply constraints to meaningfully change beyond what we've experienced in the first half of the year as we look to the back half of the year. I mean it's still, I'd call it, what's the best word, choppy. We're seeing pockets of pressure and pockets of improvement. As I mentioned in my remarks, I'd tell you, we kind of a tick down, which is barely negligible. So not expecting any necessarily meaningful change in the back half of the year. But for us, that means we just continue to navigate and press our competitive advantages and navigate as we have been through these past several years. And that's what I say about the supply chain.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim, please go ahead.\nJames Suva: Thank you. Chris, now with the rising interest rate environment, can you talk about have customers changed their behavior at all, asked for some better funding, or talked to you about that at all? And how should we think about that interest rate environment also on the financials of CDW? So that's kind of both my questions on the same topic on your customers and then on your own self company. Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, Jim, good to hear from you. Let me start with the customers. And what I would say, and this is more of a general answer to the current environment and uncertainties out there. Interest rates going up, labor shortages, inflation, everything that we hear about in the headlines. What I would say is customers are being disciplined around their investments, and that is good for CDW in so far as they look to a trusted adviser with the depth of experience we have to be able to work with them towards the best solutions. So the environment, frankly, is playing into our competitive advantages. And we're not seeing that type of macro environment impact. Our sales opportunities, our profit opportunities, on the contrary, is actually being something that pulls us in more closely with our customers. So I'll just answer that part of it, and I'll turn it to Al for interest expense vis-a-vis CDW?\nAlbert Miralles: Yes, sure, Jim. So first on your question, on any change in attitude or direction with customers with respect to financing, et cetera. I would say no, nothing material there. As we typically would, with every customer, we're looking at the avenues of whether they would like financing solutions or otherwise. But nothing's changed materially there. With respect to the impact to us from a financing perspective and interest expense, based on my prepared remarks, we do have a component of our debt that's floating rate. We did see in the quarter a bit of a tick up in the interest expense commensurate with that. And we've got that baked into our outlook. We do have interest rate caps in place, we just haven't quite hit those yet. We do feel like that's kept out, and it's certainly manageable.\nJames Suva: Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. It's greatly appreciated.\nChristine Leahy: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Erik, please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Thank you so much. And thanks for taking my questions this morning, guys. Maybe, Chris, if I start with you, if we take a step back, you've obviously \u2013 CDW has obviously consistently outperformed IT market growth from anywhere between 200 to 500 basis points in any given year. How do you think about kind of \u2013 in the potential that this market gets more challenging, how do you think about the potential to increase those share gains? And kind of what I'm getting at is maybe the implication would be slower IT market growth in that type of scenario, but given your scale, you reach the broad breadth of products that you have, do you see a more recessionary type of environment as an opportunity for CDW to gain share perhaps in excess of your average annual outperformance versus the IT market? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, sure, Erik. Again, the answer is yes, some of these short answers. The answer is yes. We certainly perceive and \u2013 look, we have historically been well positioned and outperformed the market and our peers in challenging macro environments. And we would expect that to be similar going forward. In fact, I would say that we are better positioned now than ever to be opportunistic in down markets given the full spectrum of our technology solutions. For our customers now needing a trusted adviser that can \u2013 that brings the comprehensive suite of solutions in the complete end-to-end services is required has become more integral and more essential to how they do business. And so the answer is yes, we would intend to press our competitive advantages and we see great opportunity. And that's been part of what we've been really focused on building over the past couple of years through executing our strategy and ensuring that our portfolio is fulsome and has the services that are relevant to delivering on the solutions our customers need.\nErik Woodring: Okay. Super. And then maybe, Al, one for you. Obviously, 19% gross margin. I think that's an all-time high, obviously, very strong. You kind of went through the three different drivers earlier in your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering if there's any way you can kind of quantify or help us better understand the significant of those three factors relative to each other, meaning how significant was the mix of netted down revenue to gross margins perhaps versus the inclusion of Sirius versus perhaps mix on the non-netted down revenue side? Would just love to get a better understanding there, and that's it for me.\nAlbert Miralles: Sure, Erik. So first, I didn't mention Sirius, right, because we would think of Sirius more kind of macro level. But I would just note that the contribution from Sirius and really the power of putting the teams together, we are seeing exactly what we would have expected in terms of accretive effect on gross margin. On the netted down revenues, I mentioned grew 30% year-over-year, 28% of gross profit. That was a solid contribution there, absolute dollar amount consistent with Q1. But what was the different for this quarter is we had even stronger contributions from professional services, right, which is coming online and accelerating. And then firm margins on product. And so multiple variables there. In terms \u2013 as we look forward and we think about durability, look, there's always going to be puts and takes, and that's why our outlook focuses on in July margin because it's just a little bit more balanced, a little bit more stable. But certainly, this quarter, you saw all those contributions on the gross margin front come to four.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you, Al.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Matthew, please go ahead.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes. Thank You. Good morning. I wanted to ask another question regarding the PC market and your outlook there. You talked about double-digit growth on the commercial side and very strong backlog still. But you also talked about solutions growing faster in the back half as it did last quarter. So could you give us an outlook there in terms of backlog and supply improving there? And is that enabling you to fill that backlog? And do you see that falling off in the second half?\nChristine Leahy: Hi. Matt, let me start on this, and then we can dive into the backlog a little more specifically. The way I would characterize it is we do continue to expect resilient commercial demand. As we've said a number of times, end client devices, endpoint devices are low-cost productivity enhancing investment. And given the changing dynamics of delivering goods, digital curbside, et cetera, they've just become part and parcel of the solutions for every commercial business. In terms of the total client device sales and backlog, we had healthy \u2013 I think it was low single-digit client device growth this year, which compared to anything out there, I think, has been really solid. In terms of the backlog, we have had some backlog open up a little bit over the last six months or so, I think. But Al, did you want to add more about the backlog specifically?\nAlbert Miralles: Yes. Matt, I would say, as we mentioned, no significant changes thematically in the backlog in terms of the pressure points versus relief. To Chris' point on client device, it's just more fluid, right. So we see a bit more flow. And we've mentioned this before, but if nothing else, we have a bit more read into transparency of what to expect on lead times. But look, the friction is still there on the solutions space, and we wouldn't expect that, that's going to change. Our job is to continue to navigate it and be there for the customers to get some stuff as quick as we can and most effectively.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Thanks very much for that. And then just turning to your outlook on the solutions side and specifically, investments from customers in infrastructure. We're picking up from our VAR survey that customers are taking longer to close larger deals, being a little bit more scrutinous on deals requiring more sign-offs. Are you seeing that at all in terms of hesitation or a little bit more scrutiny from customers on deals?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, I guess here's how I characterize it. With the context of the last couple of years, where I'd say your normal purchasing process kind of was put aside a little bit, I would just say that we're kind of back to a normalized disciplined buying process. And I wouldn't characterize it beyond that. And as I said earlier, that's actually good for CDW because we're a trusted adviser and can help our customers make the best, most cost-effective, most effective decisions in the process.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu, please go ahead.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, in the past, you've talked about the SMB or small medium business segment as a bellwether for the macro environment, as they react fast to the macro changes. This quarter looks like revenue growth slowed to 4% year-on-year albeit on tough compares. And you've kept the full year guidance changed and you had a strong fiscal 2Q. So first, can you give us your thoughts on what the SMB segment is indicating to you? And then second, on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, you talked several times about continuing to invest in the business. It looks like CapEx as a percent of sales declined slightly to 0.6%. So just give us your thoughts on what areas of investment you would like to make in this environment? And how would you just judge the success of those investments?\nChristine Leahy: Good morning, Ruplu. Let me start with small business. And look, we're pleased with small business results. We're just \u2013 we're not seeing weakness to date. And I just would say investors and analysts should not extrapolate from the decelerating growth rates. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, small business customer spend was up, but it was in the categories of areas that net down. So a more appropriate barometer of the health of demand in small business, we think, is gross profit performance, which increased at more than twice the rate of sales growth. So I would just keep focused on that. Cloud and Software Solutions were really, really well \u2013 delivered really, really well this quarter. We also, just to be clear, continue to see strong momentum in the strategic execution and small business across a wide variety of solutions that customers are investing in. So whether it's solutions to modernize and optimize their infrastructure, whether it's continued remote enablement, which we're still seeing resilience in. But we're not looking at small businesses softening at this point. It's really been resilient and momentum is strong. In terms of investments, what I would tell you is we're a people business. So when you think about investments that are maybe noncapital-intensive related, that's all about people. If you look at the acquisitions and the number of folks in our technology organization that we've brought to CDW, the number that we've hired over the year, they're organically brought in. But then think about things like our CRM program and modernizing our CRM program using Salesforce. If you think about our unique training programs that are very specific to CDW, our training programs are best in the business. When you think about leadership development. When you think about all of the things that we're doing that drive efficiency and effectively and productivity for our sales organization, and the ability for our technical organization and sales organization to go to market as a one CDW company, as one team, all those investments are the kinds of things that we're doing to continue to execute our strategy.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thanks for the clarification and the details there. For my follow-up, if I can just ask, it was great to see the federal business grew year-on-year. Do you think that strength continues? And within Government, how should we think about the relative growth from federal versus state and local in the second half of this year? Thanks, again.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, I'll start with that one. Yes, so we've said that we would expect Fed to continue growth, start growth in the second half of the year and continuing \u2013 it will \u2013 I would expect it to look more seasonal. I think we're kind of back into more of a seasonal rhythm with federal. And state and local has been interesting because, as you know, the budget \u2013 the funding that they've received has allowed them to make investment decisions over a more extended period of time versus the one year that they typically do. And we've been supporting customers with that. All that said, given things like data proliferation, et cetera, they're still investing now. So you can expect to see solid growth across both of those sales channels in the second half of the year.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Thanks for all the details and congrats on the strong execution.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith, please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning. Chris, maybe perhaps talk about CDW's own hiring plans for the rest of the year and how you're seeing that growth?\nChristine Leahy: Hi, Keith. Our hiring plans for the rest of the year?\nKeith Housum: Yes. I'm just trying to understand \u2013 yes, please.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, we're still investing in people. Obviously, we've got our eyes on the headlines. We're being prudent in how we run our business, but we're continuing to invest in those areas that support the important capabilities that our customer needs from us. And we're investing in areas to drive efficiency. So we have not slowed down our investment in people at this point, and we feel very confident with that.\nKeith Housum: Great. I appreciate it. And then maybe talk to investors in terms of the concerns about the chip manufacturers and concerns that PCs will be slowing down. How would you address that question? And is this soon the chips, is that perhaps a canary of the coal mine for the entire tech industry?\nChristine Leahy: I had a hard time hearing the beginning. Can you just repeat the question, please?\nKeith Housum: Yes, absolutely. So the question from investors that we're getting oftentimes is looking at the sales of PCs and with the chip manufacturers now believing that the chips will be down to personal computers by, say, 10% to 15% for the rest of the year, there's concerns that, that might be a canary in the coal mine for technology spending. How will you respond to that question?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. What I would say is I think technology spending is going to be even more resilient in the face of all kinds of challenges going forward because it's so essential to businesses, whether it is challenges around chips, challenges around the macro environment, et cetera, businesses can't win in the marketplace without utilizing technology to drive efficiency, effectiveness, experience, all the things we talk about. So we aren't concerned about some of that talk track. We feel very confident that our customers and we see the momentum. Our customers are continuing to invest in technology across the spectrum from endpoint solutions to hybrid infrastructure. And we feel very confident that we'll be able to press our competitive advantages and have access to the technology needed for our customers given our size and scale.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Lauren Lucas from Evercore. Lauren, please go ahead.\nLauren Lucas: Hi. This is Lauren on for Amit. Thanks for taking the question. Could you guys provide some more color on the change in expectations to netted down revenues for the second half? So I know you guys talked about SMB shifting spend this way. But I mean, how should we be thinking about this kind of in terms of where gross margins could reach? Thank you.\nAlbert Miralles: Yes. Thanks, Lauren. This is Al. I think look, previous to today, we talked about we expected a higher level of netted down revenues in the second half, and that still holds true. If we look at Q2 and the contributors to our gross margin, otherwise, I talked about professional services, obviously, at a macro level the accretive effect of Sirius and product margins were firm. But the theme kind of as we look at the second half as well as really ongoing with netted down revenues, which makes up just for clarity, SaaS software assurance, warranty and commissions, those themes continue. And we continue to expect that they will outpace our net sales overall.\nLauren Lucas: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That is the end of the Q&A session today. So I will now hand you back over to Chris Leahy for closing remarks.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you very much, Lauren. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our over 14,600 coworkers around the globe. Their dedication to serving our customers is what makes us successful and in particular, embracing a better together approach and philosophy as we've brought together many amazing companies over these last few years.

            "name": "Albert Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with additional detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2022 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 8. Consolidated net sales were $6.1 billion, up 19.4% on a reported and an average daily sales basis. On a constant currency average daily sales basis, consolidated net sales grew 20.5%. On an average daily sales basis, sequential sales increased 1.7% versus the first quarter. Second quarter sales were in line with our expectations, reflecting broad-based and balanced growth across our portfolio. On the supply side, consistent with last quarter, we saw pockets of improvement and pockets of pressure. The change in our overall backlog compared to the first quarter was insignificant. Year-over-year, our backlog remains elevated in both transactional and solution categories, and we continue to manage inventory strategically to support our customers through this uncertain supply environment. The team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantages to ensure strong returns on working capital. We had excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 32.3%. Gross profit margin was a record 19%, up 180 basis points versus last year. The expansion in gross profit margin was driven by several factors. First, increased netted down revenues, primarily within Software-as-a-Service as the category continued to grow faster than overall net sales. Netted down revenues represented 28% of total gross profit; second, product margins were strong, driven by both mix and resilient demand for certain hardware products; and third, net sales and high-margin professional service business nearly doubled as a result of our recent acquisition. Turning to SG&A on Slide 9. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $652 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll consistent with higher gross profit and higher coworker count. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was nearly 14,600, up roughly 3,900 from the prior year quarter, reflecting organic and inorganic investments in coworkers that support high-growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. Investment in our coworkers and in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. We are seeing our disciplined and balanced investments pay dividends as evidenced by record sales and profitability in the period. GAAP operating income was $435 million, up 17.7%. Non-GAAP operating income was $516 million, up 23.5%. Non-GAAP operating income margin was a record 8.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and 60 basis points from Q1. Moving to Slide 10. Interest expense was $58 million. Higher interest expense is primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius as well as higher interest rates on our floating rate debt. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 11, was 26%. This resulted in second quarter tax expense of $98 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 12. For the quarter, non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9%, up 50 basis points versus last year as a result of an increase in nondeductible expenses. As you can see on Slide 13, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per share was $2.04. Our non-GAAP net income was $340 million in the quarter, up 19%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.49, up 23% from last year. Year-to-date results can be found on Slides 14 through 19. Moving ahead to Slide 20. At period end, cash and cash equivalents were $542 million and net debt was $6 billion. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.7 billion. Moving to Slide 20. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down two days from last year's second quarter and reflecting a tighter spread between DSO and DPO. Year-to-date free cash flow was $717 million, as shown on Slide 21. This is higher than a typical first half, reflecting strong growth in the business and effective working capital management. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives, including returning $68 million to shareholders through dividends and further reducing our net leverage ratio, which brings me to our capital allocation on Slide 22. Our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases, we will continue to target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. We ended the quarter at 2.9x, down from 3.4x at the end of 2021, demonstrating strong growth in the business and excellent cash generation. And while we are at the top of our targeted net leverage range, we are balancing rating agency capital expectations, which would call for us to be towards the bottom of our range. As such, we will continue to prioritize delevering until we are more firmly in our targeted net leverage range and can satisfy the commitments we made when we financed the acquisition of Sirius. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022. And while we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priority of M&A and share repurchases, we are firmly on a path to getting back to delivering on these priorities. Moving to the outlook for 2022 on Slide 23, starting with sales. Our outlook remains unchanged from last quarter on a constant currency basis, including holding our second half outlook at our initial aggressive baseline. While we are cognizant of potential market variables as we look forward, we are confident in our ability to execute, pivot to where the growth opportunities are and outperform the broader market. We continue to expect the back half of the year will reflect a greater mix in a netted down revenues as we overlap 2021's strong client device sales. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted down revenues has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars, but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margin, all else equal. With that in mind, our outlook for full-year 2022 continues to be U.S. IT market growth of 4% plus 325 basis points to 425 basis points of CDW outperformance in constant currency on a combined basis. Recall that, on a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021, including $2.17 billion from Sirius. On a reported basis, our full-year net sales outlook equates to approximately 17.5% to 18.5% growth in constant currency. Currency is expected to be a headwind of approximately $120 million to net sales in the second half of the year. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.22 to the British pound and $0.78 for the Canadian dollar in the second half. Our baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we have been experiencing. We would expect to be at the lower end of our premium range if we mix more into netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experience elevated levels of supply constraints. We would be at the higher end if hardware growth is stronger or if supply improves. Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. For non-GAAP earnings per share, recall that 2021 would have been $8.49 on a full-year combined basis compared to our reported $7.97, which included only one month of Sirius. We now expect full-year non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be in the mid-teens, call it 14% to 15% in constant currency on a combined basis. This equates to a low 20% full-year growth rate in constant currency on a reported basis. Currency is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.04 to earnings per share in the second half of the year based on the reference exchange rates. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 25. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. We expect a low single-digit increase from Q2 to Q3 on an average daily sales basis. This equates to a roughly 17% year-over-year reported net sales growth rate for the third quarter. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than reported net sales. Finally, we now expect to be towards the top-end of our long-term free cash flow rule of thumb of 3.75% to 4.25% of net sales in 2022, assuming current tax rates. As you know, timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow, and it may ebb and flow by quarter. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yes, sure, Jim. So first on your question, on any change in attitude or direction with customers with respect to financing, et cetera. I would say no, nothing material there. As we typically would, with every customer, we're looking at the avenues of whether they would like financing solutions or otherwise. But nothing's changed materially there. With respect to the impact to us from a financing perspective and interest expense, based on my prepared remarks, we do have a component of our debt that's floating rate. We did see in the quarter a bit of a tick up in the interest expense commensurate with that. And we've got that baked into our outlook. We do have interest rate caps in place, we just haven't quite hit those yet. We do feel like that's kept out, and it's certainly manageable. Sure, Erik. So first, I didn't mention Sirius, right, because we would think of Sirius more kind of macro level. But I would just note that the contribution from Sirius and really the power of putting the teams together, we are seeing exactly what we would have expected in terms of accretive effect on gross margin. On the netted down revenues, I mentioned grew 30% year-over-year, 28% of gross profit. That was a solid contribution there, absolute dollar amount consistent with Q1. But what was the different for this quarter is we had even stronger contributions from professional services, right, which is coming online and accelerating. And then firm margins on product. And so multiple variables there. In terms \u2013 as we look forward and we think about durability, look, there's always going to be puts and takes, and that's why our outlook focuses on in July margin because it's just a little bit more balanced, a little bit more stable. But certainly, this quarter, you saw all those contributions on the gross margin front come to four. Yes. Matt, I would say, as we mentioned, no significant changes thematically in the backlog in terms of the pressure points versus relief. To Chris' point on client device, it's just more fluid, right. So we see a bit more flow. And we've mentioned this before, but if nothing else, we have a bit more read into transparency of what to expect on lead times. But look, the friction is still there on the solutions space, and we wouldn't expect that, that's going to change. Our job is to continue to navigate it and be there for the customers to get some stuff as quick as we can and most effectively. Yes. Thanks, Lauren. This is Al. I think look, previous to today, we talked about we expected a higher level of netted down revenues in the second half, and that still holds true. If we look at Q2 and the contributors to our gross margin, otherwise, I talked about professional services, obviously, at a macro level the accretive effect of Sirius and product margins were firm. But the theme kind of as we look at the second half as well as really ongoing with netted down revenues, which makes up just for clarity, SaaS software assurance, warranty and commissions, those themes continue. And we continue to expect that they will outpace our net sales overall."

            "name": "Christine Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our results, strategic progress and outlook, and then Al will run through the financials and our capital allocation priorities. And then we will move right to your questions. We had an exceptional second quarter. The teams continued to execute well in a challenging supply environment and delivered all time record sales, margins and profits. For the second quarter, net sales were $6.1 billion, 19% higher than last year and our first $6 billion quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $516 million, up 23% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.49 also up 23% year-over-year. These exceptional results reflect our ability to address customers' priorities across a broad array of end markets with solutions across the full spectrum of IT. Digital transformation, agility and security remain top priorities with ongoing focus on hybrid work and return to office driving collaboration, networking and endpoint solutions. Customers also continue to seek ways to manage costs while meeting or exceeding coworker and customer service level requirements. Our ability to meet all of these needs led to a broad-based and balanced performance and was a result of three key drivers. Number one, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets; number two, the breadth of our product and solutions portfolio; and number three, our ongoing execution against our customer-centric strategy. Let's take a look at how each contributed to our growth this quarter. First, the breadth and diversity of our customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels: corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education. Each channel is a meaningful business on its own with annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $8 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered sales of US$2.6 billion. This portfolio approach enables us to toggle to the best pockets of opportunity. Each team did an exceptional job this quarter. Our corporate team delivered another record quarter with a 34% net sales increase. Results were balanced and broad-based. Customers continue to invest to stay ahead of the curve, to either begin or advance their efforts to address the accelerating pace of change. Digital transformation drove excellent solutions growth with strong double-digit increases in NetComm, servers, collaboration, cloud and software. Customers are increasingly seeking our advice and expertise in navigating their IT journeys, and this drove strong performance in professional and managed services and warranties. At the same time, corporate customers continue to turn to us to meet their needs for hybrid and return to office solutions. And the team delivered another quarter of double-digit client device growth, reflecting both unit and ASP increases. Small business performance was in line with our expectations and the team delivered a 4% increase on top of last year's 60% growth. This net sales growth understates demand as customers prioritize cloud and software solutions, which are accounted for on a netted down basis. A better barometer of customer demand in the quarter is the gross profit performance of small business, which increased at more than twice the rate of sales growth. During the quarter, customer spend increased more than 20% for both security and cloud as customers modernize, optimize and secure the applications running on their endpoint devices. Infrastructure spending is the natural follow-on from remote enablement and return to office demand. Remote enablement remains strong and the team produced another quarter of double-digit collaboration and client device growth. Public posted an 8% increase this quarter. The healthcare team delivered another excellent quarter, up 30%. We continue to help our hospital systems and healthcare organizations leverage technology to mitigate staffing shortages and wage and cost inflation. A great example of this is seamless patient intake and record keeping solutions that use biometric security to improve emergency department throughput. And while healthcare has taken a more cautious view toward cloud in the past, the benefits of flexibility and reduced IT support burden are compelling more customers to adopt cloud-based solutions, driving a double-digit increase in cloud customer spend. Government posted 19% growth. State and local performance reflected continued success helping customers maximize the value of their IT investments, leveraging our expertise in professional and managed services. At the same time, the team is helping customers navigate through the complexities of funding programs and the impact on their long-term planning efforts. While customers generally have until 2024 to 2025 to spend stimulus, data continues to proliferate and we delivered excellent cloud and storage performance. Remote collaboration continues to be a priority driving double-digit growth in devices and audio/video. As we expected, federal return to growth in the quarter. Federal customers prioritized services tied to solution inception and ongoing management. Similar to state and local, remote collaboration led to double-digit transactions growth. After the past two years of unusual spending patterns, we anticipate a return to more normal season patterns for federal, including fiscal year-end September budget activity. Higher ed's strong performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall education sales decreased 6% off of last year's excellent second quarter performance. The higher ed team continues to help universities enable student success and student access programs using technology to give institutions an enrollment edge. This includes deploying comprehensive endpoint solutions, security and campus connectivity to deliver enhanced dorm room experience. K-12 posted a healthy seasonal increase, but remained below last year's exceptional stimulus-driven results. During the quarter, a third wave of Emergency Connectivity Funding, ECF was announced, which opened July 1 and extends through December 2023, adding complexity to an already broader way of funding. We continue to work with school systems to help identify how to maximize available funding to maintain equity and access IT advancements into the future. In the near-term, the team also continues to help educators implement connected learning spaces and to enhance security. Other our combined UK and Canada results increased 24% on a reported basis. Both regions delivered excellent growth. UK was up significantly in local currency and delivered balance growth across both public and commercial with excellent remote enablement activity. Canada increased double digits in local currency, primarily driven by commercial customers with excellent solutions growth. The second driver of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio. Our ability to address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum resulted in excellent performance across our solutions and transactions portfolios. Solutions grew twice as fast as transactions. U.S. hardware increased low-double digits. Growth was broad-based and included double-digit increases in server and server management and video/audio. We also continue to see underlying strength in notebooks across our commercial business. Client devices, NetComm, enterprise storage and printing and scanning increased at a healthy single-digit rate. This exceptional performance was on top of 2021 second quarter double-digit hardware growth. Demand continued to outpace supply in several key areas, notably in networking and enterprise storage. Customers, once again, placed orders to get in line for second half 2022 projects, especially in NetComm. While overall backlog ticked down slightly from last quarter, we exited the quarter with backlog at nearly twice last year's second quarter level and once again, we leveraged our competitive advantages, including our distribution centers, our extensive logistics capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and our strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate an ongoing supply challenge. U.S. software increased nearly 40% compared to the prior year. Strength was broad-based as we continue to help customers manage data, enhance productivity and secure their IT environments with strong double-digit increases in storage and network management software, application suites and security software. Cloud was an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to profitability with customer spend and gross profit increasing by double digits. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, productivity, security, application delivery and connectivity were key growth workloads during the period. U.S. services performance was excellent this quarter. Growth was broad-based and balanced, driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. Services net sales were roughly twice last year's level and represented 8% of total sales up from 5% in 2021 and 2020. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, our customer and coworker-centric strategy. Over the past three years, we have relentlessly focused on executing our strategy to enhance our high relevance and high growth solutions and services fueled by organic and inorganic investments. Eight acquisitions have deepened and advanced our services capabilities, including automation, cloud-native and DevOps and cybersecurity. Capabilities necessary to ensure, we remain the trusted advisor to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformation. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers, whether in a physical, digital or cloud-based environment in the U.S. and internationally. Through our acquisitions, we welcomed nearly 3,000 new coworkers with more than half in technical roles. Since year-end 2018, our technical team has doubled in size. Today, more than 5,400 presales specialists and engineers work alongside our world-class sellers to deliver the complex digital transformation solutions from code to cloud and data center to database that our customers want and need. All of our investments, whether homegrown or acquired are designed to maximize our key points of differentiation in the marketplace and ensure we continue to help customers achieve the outcomes they need from technology, so they can do great things. Let me share a couple of recent examples that demonstrate how our investments are making a difference for customers. In the federal space, the power of bringing three winning teams from CDW, Sirius and Focal Point together is evident in the cybersecurity solutions we are delivering to the intelligence community. Together, the focus is on enhancing our scope across the Department of Defense and civilian agencies. To gain traction in this space, you must deliver proof-of-concept, which we do with our dedicated advanced solutions lab. You must provide training and support and you need agency to agency endorsement. While the CDW government team already had both expertise and scale, Sirius federal team brings a track record of success and solution configuration, technical integration and managed services. And our cyber experts at Focal Point Academy deliver the professional training these agencies need. Our relevance to federal customers has never been greater. The second example of how our investments enable customers to achieve great outcomes comes from our small business team. A provider of software-as-a-service solutions to pharmaceutical and life sciences companies needed to address their aging data center infrastructure. Their customers' workloads and data were being run on servers that were well beyond end of life. The servers clearly were not capable of supporting their existing business, let alone growing their SaaS offerings. The CTO initiated a competitive bidding process for a very small scale professional services contract to provide proof-of-concept on cloud migrations starting with a couple dozen servers. CDW and our competitors all utilize the same public cloud provider, but CDW1 based on our experience with migrations are proven post-migration support and our longstanding trusted relationship with the customer serving their transactional product needs. The CDW team bolstered by technical support from our IGNW, Digital Velocity Professional Services team built a secure landing zone in the public cloud and the proof-of-concept proved so successful. The customer is now migrating hundreds of servers. Seeing the huge burden, CDW lifted off the customer's engineering team who are having trouble balancing their day-to-day operations while trying to expand their cloud footprint. The customer contracted CDW for ongoing managed services of their rapidly growing cloud environment. The current annual services opportunity is at $750,000 run rate and is on a path to $1.5 million. By staying close to the customer, CDW, once again, had the opportunity to help make IT work, allowing the customer to improve the scalability and performance of their software offering. Investments in our customer and coworker-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our team's terrific execution and relentless focus on the customer, delivered significant outperformance to our baseline outlook in the first half of 2022. Given this excellent performance, we continue to expect to outperform the U.S. IT market by 325 basis points to 425 basis points, 125 basis points higher than both our long-term average level of outperformance and our original view at the end of year 2021. Our estimate of U.S. IT market growth in 2022 remains 4%. Taken together, this equates to constant currency growth of 7.25% to 8.25% above 2021 combined CDW revenues of $22.8 billion. Recall, 2021 combined CDW is calculated as though Sirius was acquired on January 1, 2021 instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1. On a reported basis, our outlook represents a 17.5% to 18.5% increase over 2021 results on a constant currency basis. Our outlook continues to reflect our baseline expectations that we will mix into more sales of solutions in the back half of the year, notably cloud and security. Given this expected change in second half mix, we also expect to deliver profit growth faster than sales growth even as we continue to invest in our future. Our outlook also continues to reflect our expectations that supply constraints remain relatively consistent with the first half of the year. While we are cognizant of economic headlines, to-date, we have not seen a change in behavior that would impact our view on the second half of the year. Of course, we remain mindful of economic risks as well as other wild cards, including the potential for further disruption to supply and changes resulting from COVID incidence rates. We will keep a watchful eye as always on these and other potential issues. And as we always do, we will provide an updated view on customer activity and our annual outlook on the next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out execute competition. We will also continue to invest to ensure we are remaining our customers trusted technology partner of choice, helping them deliver the business outcomes they need. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more details on our financials and outlook. Al? Good morning, Samik. Thanks for the question. And I would say just the short answer is yes. We are seeing our customers rely more heavily on us in the labor shortage world we're in. We've said often that technology has become just absolutely essential, more integral to our customers' success and more vital to their businesses, whether it is delivering experience, whether it is profitability, whether it's teaching kids, whether it's providing health care. It is just essential to what organizations do, and CDW is their trusted adviser. And we are continuing to see our customers lean into us more for some of the things that we referenced in our prepared remarks, for example, advisory services on the front-end professional services as they're going through their disciplined planning, et cetera. But equally, relieving their staffs of important management, like data center security and things like that. So it's been a very positive move for us and is driving some of our growth. Yes, I'll start with that. Al can add, if you'd like. I would tell you that \u2013 look, we don't expect supply constraints to meaningfully change beyond what we've experienced in the first half of the year as we look to the back half of the year. I mean it's still, I'd call it, what's the best word, choppy. We're seeing pockets of pressure and pockets of improvement. As I mentioned in my remarks, I'd tell you, we kind of a tick down, which is barely negligible. So not expecting any necessarily meaningful change in the back half of the year. But for us, that means we just continue to navigate and press our competitive advantages and navigate as we have been through these past several years. And that's what I say about the supply chain. Yes, Jim, good to hear from you. Let me start with the customers. And what I would say, and this is more of a general answer to the current environment and uncertainties out there. Interest rates going up, labor shortages, inflation, everything that we hear about in the headlines. What I would say is customers are being disciplined around their investments, and that is good for CDW in so far as they look to a trusted adviser with the depth of experience we have to be able to work with them towards the best solutions. So the environment, frankly, is playing into our competitive advantages. And we're not seeing that type of macro environment impact. Our sales opportunities, our profit opportunities, on the contrary, is actually being something that pulls us in more closely with our customers. So I'll just answer that part of it, and I'll turn it to Al for interest expense vis-a-vis CDW? Thanks, Jim. Yes, sure, Erik. Again, the answer is yes, some of these short answers. The answer is yes. We certainly perceive and \u2013 look, we have historically been well positioned and outperformed the market and our peers in challenging macro environments. And we would expect that to be similar going forward. In fact, I would say that we are better positioned now than ever to be opportunistic in down markets given the full spectrum of our technology solutions. For our customers now needing a trusted adviser that can \u2013 that brings the comprehensive suite of solutions in the complete end-to-end services is required has become more integral and more essential to how they do business. And so the answer is yes, we would intend to press our competitive advantages and we see great opportunity. And that's been part of what we've been really focused on building over the past couple of years through executing our strategy and ensuring that our portfolio is fulsome and has the services that are relevant to delivering on the solutions our customers need. Hi. Matt, let me start on this, and then we can dive into the backlog a little more specifically. The way I would characterize it is we do continue to expect resilient commercial demand. As we've said a number of times, end client devices, endpoint devices are low-cost productivity enhancing investment. And given the changing dynamics of delivering goods, digital curbside, et cetera, they've just become part and parcel of the solutions for every commercial business. In terms of the total client device sales and backlog, we had healthy \u2013 I think it was low single-digit client device growth this year, which compared to anything out there, I think, has been really solid. In terms of the backlog, we have had some backlog open up a little bit over the last six months or so, I think. But Al, did you want to add more about the backlog specifically? Yes, I guess here's how I characterize it. With the context of the last couple of years, where I'd say your normal purchasing process kind of was put aside a little bit, I would just say that we're kind of back to a normalized disciplined buying process. And I wouldn't characterize it beyond that. And as I said earlier, that's actually good for CDW because we're a trusted adviser and can help our customers make the best, most cost-effective, most effective decisions in the process. Good morning, Ruplu. Let me start with small business. And look, we're pleased with small business results. We're just \u2013 we're not seeing weakness to date. And I just would say investors and analysts should not extrapolate from the decelerating growth rates. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, small business customer spend was up, but it was in the categories of areas that net down. So a more appropriate barometer of the health of demand in small business, we think, is gross profit performance, which increased at more than twice the rate of sales growth. So I would just keep focused on that. Cloud and Software Solutions were really, really well \u2013 delivered really, really well this quarter. We also, just to be clear, continue to see strong momentum in the strategic execution and small business across a wide variety of solutions that customers are investing in. So whether it's solutions to modernize and optimize their infrastructure, whether it's continued remote enablement, which we're still seeing resilience in. But we're not looking at small businesses softening at this point. It's really been resilient and momentum is strong. In terms of investments, what I would tell you is we're a people business. So when you think about investments that are maybe noncapital-intensive related, that's all about people. If you look at the acquisitions and the number of folks in our technology organization that we've brought to CDW, the number that we've hired over the year, they're organically brought in. But then think about things like our CRM program and modernizing our CRM program using Salesforce. If you think about our unique training programs that are very specific to CDW, our training programs are best in the business. When you think about leadership development. When you think about all of the things that we're doing that drive efficiency and effectively and productivity for our sales organization, and the ability for our technical organization and sales organization to go to market as a one CDW company, as one team, all those investments are the kinds of things that we're doing to continue to execute our strategy. Yes, I'll start with that one. Yes, so we've said that we would expect Fed to continue growth, start growth in the second half of the year and continuing \u2013 it will \u2013 I would expect it to look more seasonal. I think we're kind of back into more of a seasonal rhythm with federal. And state and local has been interesting because, as you know, the budget \u2013 the funding that they've received has allowed them to make investment decisions over a more extended period of time versus the one year that they typically do. And we've been supporting customers with that. All that said, given things like data proliferation, et cetera, they're still investing now. So you can expect to see solid growth across both of those sales channels in the second half of the year. Thank you really appreciate it. Hi, Keith. Our hiring plans for the rest of the year? Yes, we're still investing in people. Obviously, we've got our eyes on the headlines. We're being prudent in how we run our business, but we're continuing to invest in those areas that support the important capabilities that our customer needs from us. And we're investing in areas to drive efficiency. So we have not slowed down our investment in people at this point, and we feel very confident with that. I had a hard time hearing the beginning. Can you just repeat the question, please? Yes. What I would say is I think technology spending is going to be even more resilient in the face of all kinds of challenges going forward because it's so essential to businesses, whether it is challenges around chips, challenges around the macro environment, et cetera, businesses can't win in the marketplace without utilizing technology to drive efficiency, effectiveness, experience, all the things we talk about. So we aren't concerned about some of that talk track. We feel very confident that our customers and we see the momentum. Our customers are continuing to invest in technology across the spectrum from endpoint solutions to hybrid infrastructure. And we feel very confident that we'll be able to press our competitive advantages and have access to the technology needed for our customers given our size and scale. Thank you very much, Lauren. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our over 14,600 coworkers around the globe. Their dedication to serving our customers is what makes us successful and in particular, embracing a better together approach and philosophy as we've brought together many amazing companies over these last few years. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I will begin today\u2019s call with a brief overview of our results, strategic progress and outlook and Al will run through the financials and our capital allocation priorities. And then we\u2019ll move right to your questions. We had an outstanding start to the year. The team\u2019s continued to execute well in a challenging supply environment and delivered exceptional top line growth and profitability. For the first quarter net sales were $5.9 billion, 23% higher than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $462 million up 26% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.20 up 26% on a reported basis. These exceptional results reflect our ability to address customer priorities with solutions across the full spectrum of IT and the inclusion of Sirius. Customers continue to evolve as we move ahead into the new normal. Digital transformation, agility and security remained top concerns with return to office driving collaboration, networking and endpoint solutions. Customers want to manage costs while meeting or exceeding coworker and customer service level requirements. At the same time, customers across our diverse and markets are seeking ways to supplement technology resources in today\u2019s war for talent environment. Our ability to meet all these needs led to a broad based and balanced performance. There were three drivers of our performance during the quarter. The first driver with our broad and diverse portfolio of customer end markets, as you know we have five U.S. sales channels; corporate small business, health care, government and education. Each of these channels is a meaningful business on its own, with 2021 annual sales ranging from $1.8 billion to over $6 billion. Within each channel teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together deliver $2.6 billion U.S. in 2021 sales. This scale and balance across customer and markets positions us to perform when external factors impact certain sectors or geographies. This quarter our commercial markets, corporate and small business, along with our healthcare and international markets all delivered strong double digit growth. As expected education and government growth was depressed as they left strong prior year stimulus and large deal driven results. Our corporate team delivered a 46% increase. Growth was strong and balanced across transactions and solutions. The team did an excellent job addressing customer demand for return to Work solutions, digital transformation and the need for agility and security. Unit growth coupled with ASP increases resulted in another quarter of strong double digit growth in client devices and cloud spend was excellent. Small business posted a 21% increase performance was broad based across both transactions and solutions. Return to office strategy and modernizing workspaces drove strong collaboration, networking and security growth for hybrid work environments. Remote enablement drove another strong quarter of client device growth up double digits both in unit and ASPs. Security performance was up mid teens and cloud spend was robust. Public posted a 6% increase on top of last year\u2019s exceptional 20% plus growth. Healthcare increased 27%. Ongoing focus on driving productivity to offset higher costs from staffing shortages and other acute care needs lead to double digit solutions growth. Cloud adoption was strong driven by the speed and efficiency cloud solutions can deliver. Government posted a mid single digit increase. State and local delivered a high single digit increase driven by client devices and security. As we shared last quarter, we continue to help our customers as they work through the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing and expect projects to continue to be implemented as we move through 2022. Federal performance played out as expected and was balanced across both the department of defense and civilian while lapping tough compares. As we shared last quarter, we continue to experience the lumpy nature of government contracts and contracting changes. There is no change to our expectation that growth will return later in the year.  Higher ed strong double digit performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall education sales decreased 4% off the first quarter of 2021 remarkable 101% growth. The higher ed team continues to help customers implement student success programs using technology to give an institution an edge with comprehensive endpoint solutions, improve security, campus connectivity and enhanced dorm room experiences. The team delivered excellent client device growth and school systems tapped our capabilities to address the war for technology talent which drove increased usage of CDW services to fill the gap in staffing needs. While K-12 delivered strong non-seasonal results they posted a year-over-year decline on top of last year\u2019s exceptional 100% growth. Emergency connectivity funding which was expected to end during the first half of 2022 was extended and a third wave was announced adding complexity to an already challenging process. Many school systems are leveraging the extended funding window to digest better options and plans for their IT spend. Other our combined UK and Canada results increased 13% on a reported basis. UK grew double digits in local currency and Canada increased high single digits in local currency. Each market saw balanced strength across both commercial and public customers. Customer priorities remain similar to those in the U.S. The second driver of first quarter performance with our broad and deep product and solutions portfolio. Our ability to address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum drove excellent performance across both our solutions and transactions portfolios. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages including our distribution centers, extensive logistic capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate an ongoing supply challenge. U.S. hardware increased high teens. Growth was broad based and included double digit increases in net cash on servers and server management, client devices, and video/audio. This exceptional performance was on top of 2020 one\u2019s first quarter double digit high hardware growth. Demand continued to outpace supply in several key areas, notably in the networking space, and remaining orders built during the quarter. Customers once again placed orders to get in line for second half 2022 projects, especially in Netcom. U.S. software posted a 40% increase driven by success helping customers upgrade their edge and secure their IT environments with double digit increases network management software and security software. Cloud was a meaningful contributor to this quarter strong performance with significant double digit increases in customer spend and gross profit led by productivity, platform, security and collaboration workloads. U.S. services sales doubled. Growth was broad based and balanced, driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. As you can see excellent, broad and balanced performance across the business. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter; our customer and coworker centric strategy. Over the past three years, we have executed against our strategy to enhance our high relevant and high growth solutions and services with both organic and inorganic investments. Eight acquisitions have deepened and advanced our services capabilities including automation, cloud native and DevOps, cyber security, and our services scale and reach. We welcomed nearly 3,000 new coworkers from these eight acquisitions with more than half and technical rules. Since year end 2018 our technical team has doubled in size, and at the end of this first quarter was more than 5,000 strong. Today, technical coworkers comprise more than half of all customer facing coworkers. Together with their other CDW colleagues, they form an amazing high performing team; a high performing team that is a key competitive advantage for CDW, a team that is the most engaged enabled and energize team in the industry. All our investments whether homegrown or inorganic, are intended to maximize our key point of differentiation in the marketplace. We are a one stop trusted partner with capabilities across the entire continuum of IT. Capabilities that help customers achieve the outcomes they need from technology so they can do great things. Let me share a couple of recent customer examples that demonstrate how our investments help customers achieve outcomes. A soft drink manufacturer wanted to upgrade their on-premise voice system. The customer had two desired outcomes for the solution. Number one flexibility to expand as their business grew. And number two an excellent user experience. Since IT staff was focused on other priorities, the solution needed to be managed off-premise. Leveraging CDW is world class unified communications as a service capability and ServiceNow capabilities the team designed a flexible and cost competitive, integrated full stack managed collaboration anywhere solution. The solution included CDW professional services for upfront design, planning, configuration and deployment and CDW managed services to provide ongoing MCA support and integration with our ServiceNow ticketing platform. A great outcome for the customer and for the team who bested large telecom providers to win the deal. They also deepen their relationship with the customer and delivered more than 3 million in licensing and services revenues. The second example of how our investments enable customers to achieve the outcomes they need is the recent adoption of Focal Point Academy by a major technology company. Focal Point Academy is a bespoke training program that delivers workforce development programs that solve today\u2019s greatest cyber security problems; finding training and retaining skilled cyber professionals. Focal Point Academy operationally focused portfolio which covers high demand topics like threat hunting and application security, coupled with its ability to train and develop both senior and junior technical professionals was exactly what the customer needed to achieve its desired outcome of mitigating risk. Prior to our acquisition of focal point, we would not have been able to deliver this important global solution and further deepen our relationship with the customer. Investments in our customer and coworker centric growth strategy are integral to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that leads to our expectations for the rest of the year. During the balance of 2022, we will continue to execute against our strategy to deepen our services and solutions capabilities. We are making excellent integration progress with Sirius and that will remain a key focus area for the balance of 2022 as will investments in our coworkers and our own digital transformation. We will continue to balance investments with our growth and profitability expectations which are now higher than previously shared at year end. Given our excellent momentum coming into the second quarter and first quarter performance, we now expect to outperform the U.S. IT market by 325 to 425 basis points, 125 basis points higher than our view at year end 2021. Our view of U.S. IT market growth has also increased and we now look for 2022 growth of 4% which is 50 basis points above our prior view. Taken together this equates to constant certain constant currency growth of seven and a quarter to eight and a quarter percent above 2021 combined CDW revenues of $22.8 billion. Recall 2021 combined CDW is calculated as those Sirius had been acquired on January 1, 2021 instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1 since our outlook represents a 17.5% to 18.5% increase over 2021 results. This outlook reflects our baseline expectations that given 2021 second half strong hardware performance, we will mix into more cloud and security in the back half of this year. It also reflects our expectation that supply constraints remain relatively consistent with the first half of the year. As always, we remain mindful of our wildcards, the potential for further disruption to the supply chain, changes in COVID, or macro economic performance and we will keep a watchful eye on these and other potential issues. As we always do, we will provide an update on our view on our next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best which is leverage our competitive advantages and out execute the competition. We will also continue to invest to ensure we remain our customers trusted partner who delivers the outcomes they need whether for innovation, cost management, agility, risk mitigation or user experience. If the past two years have shown us anything it is that our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. Let me turn it over to Al now who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\nAl Miralles: Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with their 2022 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on slide 8 consolidated net sales are $5.9 billion up 23% on a reported and average daily sales basis in constant currency. On an average daily sales basis sequential sales increased 7.4% versus the fourth quarter which is well above historical average sequential decline of 5%. This reflected two primary factors; first demand for return to work and remote enablement solutions remain strong and drove sequential growth in our commercial channels, and international. As Chris mentioned, corporate and small business had broad based and balanced growth across both transactions and solutions. Second, Q1 reported results reflected three months of contribution from Sirius versus one month in Q4. Notwithstanding that Sirius is first quarter has historically been the lowest quarter of absolute sales and gross profit dollars for the business. On the supply side, our overall backlog increased in Q1 at a similar level to the fourth quarter remain elevated year-over-year in both transactional and solution categories. We continue to make strategic investments and inventory to support our customers through this constrained supply environment and the team once again did a great job leveraging CDW\u2019s competitive advantage to ensure strong returns on working capital. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 million a year-over-year increase of 38.8%. Netted down revenues grew faster than the underlying business represented nearly 31% of total gross profit more than three points over the last year. A higher mix of net service contract revenue, primarily within Software as a Service, favorable product mix and rate and increase net sales and margin on professional services combined to deliver a record gross margin of 18.6% up 220 basis points versus last year. Turning to SG&A on slide 9 non-GAAP SG&A totaled $642 million for the quarter. Year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll as a result of the increase coworkers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 14,005 up over 3800 from prior year quarter reflecting organic and inorganic investments in coworkers that support high growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. Recall that Sirius as payroll as a percentage of net sales is higher than our core operations given their higher mix of solutions and services revenues. And this ratio is historically highest in the first quarter due to sale seasonality. The higher level of SG&A also reflects continued investments in the training and development of coworkers, return to office efforts and investment in our own digital transformation and technology strategy. As Chris mentioned, we will continue to balance investment with their growth and profitability expectations. Investments in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. GAAP operating income was $387 million up 19.6%. Non-GAAP operating income was $462 million up 25.7% and non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.8% up 20 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points from Q4. Moving to slide 10, interest expense was $56 million. Higher interest expense is primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 11 was 24.3%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $80 million. To get our non-GAAP effective tax rate we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, as shown on slide 12. For the for quarter our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.7% up 50 basis points versus last year\u2019s rate primarily driven by higher state taxes as well as taxes on foreign earnings. As you can see on slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 137 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.83. Our non-GAAP net income was $302 million in the quarter up 21%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.20 up 27% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 14, at March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $387 million and net debt was $6.2 billion. Liquidity remain strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to slide 15, a three month average cash conversion cycle is 20 days down two days from last year\u2019s first quarter, reflecting the impact of the Sirius acquisition. Free cash flow for the quarter was $466 million, as shown on slide 16. This is higher than a typical first quarter reflecting strong growth in the business and effective working capital management. For the quarter we deployed cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives of paying dividends and paying down debt including $67 million of dividends and $260 million in debt repayments. Turning to capital allocation on slide 17, our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases we will continue to target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 3.1 times down from 3.4 times at the end of 2021 demonstrating strong cash generation and progress towards returning to our targeted net leverage ratio. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022. While we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases until net leverage is in our target range we are on a path to delivering on these priorities. Moving to the outlook for 2022 on slide 18, starting with sales. As Chris mentioned, the first quarter was a great start to the year. We have excellent momentum entering Q2. We are cognizant of potential market variables as we look further out. Recall that on a combined basis, CDW\u2019s net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021 from Sirius. With that in mind our updated outlook for the full year 2022 is now us it market growth of 4% plus 325 to 425 basis points of CDW outperformance in constant currency on a combined basis. On a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 17.5% to 18.5% growth in constant currency. A baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we\u2019ve been experiencing. We would expect to be at the lower end of our premium range, we mix more in the netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experienced elevated levels of supply constraints. We bet the higher end of hardware growth is stronger and supply improves. Our outlook also assumes neutral currency impact for the full year. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. Our non-GAAP earnings per share recall that 2021 would have been $8.49 per share on a full year combined basis compared to a reported $7.97 per share, which includes only one month of Sirius. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be approximately 13% plus or minus 50 basis points in constant currency and on a combined basis. This equates to low 20% full year growth in constant currency on a reported basis. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on an annual constant currency basis. Slide 19 provides additional modeling thoughts, including our updated net sales split for the year. We now expect the first half of the year to be approximately 25 basis points above the high end of our historic norm of 48% to 49%. This reflects our over performance in the first quarter and strong momentum coming into Q2. It also reflects that it\u2019s too early to update our expectations for the second half of the year. We continue to expect the back half of the year reflecting greater mix and netted down revenues as we overlap 2021 strong client device sales. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted down revenues has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins all else equal. Our expectations for the first half split, a low single digit sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis, this equates to close to 20% year-over-year reported net sales growth in the second quarter, which is roughly 230 basis points above our Q2 implied growth rate expectations from last quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with the second quarter reported sales. Finally, as you know timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow. It may ebb and flow by quarter, but over the content continuum. We continue to expect to be within our long term free cash flow rule of thumb of three and three quarters to four and a quarter percent of net sales, assuming current tax rates. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open up for questions. And can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we will take is from Matthew Sheerin from Stifel. Matt your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes, thank you and good morning. My first question is just regarding the strength you\u2019re seeing across corporate and SMB customers in terms of the remote enablement as it seems like there is a second wave of work from home trends and can you elaborate on that and also, just in terms of the back to office trends. How long do you see that playing out and due to the backlog and the supply constraints do you see this playing out through the year?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Good morning Matt. It\u2019s Chris. Yes what we are seeing is customers across our commercial segments, kind of as we mentioned last time getting on with it meaning living within the current environment and making decisions about their back to work strategy, which means they\u2019re bolstering their capabilities in offices. They are bolstering their capability in home environments, because they\u2019re really focused on their co-workers ability to be productive, and deliver seamlessly moving from remote to in office. And as we expected, we continue to see very strong endpoint solution performance this quarter. And we\u2019re also seeing what usually, typically follows that and what was delayed a bit over the last couple of years which is an investment in the hybrid infrastructure to support all the needs of the coworkers and the expectations both at the workload and application level and everything required to create a stronger and more robust infrastructure for those devices. So we will continue to see those two dynamics play out through the course of the year would be our views. It\u2019s different in different segments, but in the current commercial segment, for sure, we\u2019ll continue to see that. \nMatthew Sheerin: Okay, thank you for that. And the education market seems to be holding up better than most expect. You talked about some of the dynamics there, higher ed spending, offset by weakness in K through 12. Although it seems like that next round of or the extended funding period at least helps that market near term. Should we expect a fall off there? You\u2019re following that funding period, or just general expectations for the K through 12 market?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, Matt so I think about it, the extension in the new, the little bit of an added round of funding for ECF just is timing. So it gave the schools a little bit of a breather to reflect on their planning and not be rushed to buy. So that\u2019s just an extension. So we\u2019ll see that play out over the next 18 months. At the same time schools are working very hard on ensuring that they don\u2019t lose ground in what they\u2019re trying to do which is teach students and learn. And so when you think about the dynamics of the classroom and the infrastructure needs to support the classroom including audio, visual, interactive monitors, and kind of the new generation of the classroom, we\u2019re starting to already help our customers with that. So look, we look at this as a kind of steady ed long term growth opportunity for CDW at every time there\u2019s been an inflection point in K through 12, in the classroom learning space, CDW has been at the absolute tip of the spear and helping customers get there. And we\u2019ve seen growth as a result.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Erik, your line is now open, please proceed with your question. \nErik Woodring: Great, thank you very much. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the results. Maybe as we sit here 90 days, since you last reported or roughly 90 days, maybe can you just help us understand where some of the supply challenges you\u2019ve been facing? How have you either worsened or where some have improved? And then I have a follow up from there?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, I guess, what word would I use? I think I\u2019d say kind of unchanged. Meaning we\u2019re not seeing a lot of change in the challenges that we\u2019re all facing. When we think about the supply chain environment, I\u2019d say two things. Number one, it\u2019s an opportunity. But it\u2019s also frustrating. It\u2019s an opportunity for CDW because we know what\u2019s happening, we have more visibility with our partners, I think, than anybody. When you think about our competitive advantages, our ability to take on inventory to support our customers with our balance sheet, having the distribution logistics capabilities, that\u2019s put us in a great position to manage the supply chain issues, I think, again, better than anybody in the market. But it\u2019s frustrating for customers. And we\u2019re helping customers get through that, because we can help them choose alternatives, which they\u2019re a little more open minded now to which we have a pretty good path to get to. But the short answer is supply chain is what it is. And it\u2019s not getting better. It\u2019s not getting worse, some pockets are getting better, some pockets are getting more difficult. But net-net, we\u2019re going to be living with this through 2022 if not into 2023. And again, it\u2019s a matter of who manages it the best and I think we\u2019re doing a really good job of that.\nErik Woodring: Great, super helpful and then maybe my follow up would just be you\u2019d beat the first quarter by a healthy amount, call it 280 million, 290 million, you raise the full year guide by 400 million. And then your guide implies 2Q needs to come up by let\u2019s call it $115 million. So most of the raise comes from 1Q and 2Q, is that just you guys taking the view here that perhaps visibility into the back half might not be as clear as perhaps any other year given the supply challenges and what\u2019s going on the market? Or is there anything else that we should be thinking about just as we think about the second half mixing netted down revenue those types of factors?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, no, Erik, it\u2019s a fair question. Look, its CDW\u2019s typical approach, which is we\u2019ll call it when we\u2019re ready to call it and when we think we have a good visibility. And it\u2019s just too early to call that in the back half of the year right now. But that said outstanding start to the year as you know, and we see absolutely excellent momentum going into Q2 and expect what a robust 20% profit growth in the second half of 2022. So we look at this and see a really aggressive but achievable goal in front of us. So we\u2019re feeling very optimistic about the year and what we\u2019ll call the back half of the year when we get a little closer in the back half of the year.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you so much. Congrats again.\nChristine Leahy: Thanks very much. I appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan. Samik your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, yes, this is Joe on for Samik Chatterjee. So my first question is a follow up on the full year guide. Question prior can we dissect that a little bit particularly as it relates to the rate outlook for the underlying it market and CDW has outperformance to it? What are you seeing as the main drivers or contributors to the rate outlook for both? And then I guess how much of that rate outlook is being driven by recent acquisitions like Sirius tracking better than expected, as opposed to kind of the traditional CDW business? And then I have a follow up.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, so let me start with the last past part first, which is our premium to market. And we when we look at the areas that we\u2019ve outperformed in Q1 let\u2019s take notebook overall solutions. Several areas where we just our view is look, we\u2019re really outperforming the market, it\u2019s pretty clear. So that goes into the premium. In terms of whether or not Sirius is contributing, here\u2019s how I think about it on a combined basis we\u2019re responding to customer needs in the current environment and seeing healthy business across both the underlying and Sirius segments. In terms of the underlying IT industry, yes, we brought that up, because we\u2019re starting to feel real momentum in the business, the demand is there, the writings there. So it just feels to us, like the market is growing a little faster than we would have thought at the beginning of the year. So the IT market generally is kind of the written in demand that we\u2019re seeing. The premium is the categories that we\u2019re delivering in and looking at what we triangulate the growth rates to be in the market, we just think we\u2019re outperforming by a wide margin.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then just quickly for my follow up, can you help me understand what you guys are seeing from a pricing perspective versus 90 days goes, and whether that\u2019s translating into a tailwind or headwind for CDW? \nChristine Leahy: Yes we are, look, pricing continues to be fairly dynamic and fluid, I guess I\u2019d say. And we are continuing to see pricing increases, given what\u2019s happening out in the macro environment that said we are a cost plus model, as you know, and we are not seeing constraints in IT budgets, our customers are still buying, they\u2019re not cutting it budgets because of pricing. And as I think I mentioned our prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing some of the growth kind of split between unit increases and ASP increases. So they\u2019re both contributing to growth across the board, really.\nAl Miralles: Two things I would just add in and I am more, one thing we see in the supply environment is more creativity and agility, both ourselves and with our partners in terms of where do we pivot to different products, where do we pivot to different solutions and finding customers are accommodating that working with us to try to get to their solutions sooner than later. So that certainly had a bit of an impact from a mix and rate perspective. So just I would note that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate the colors. \nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nRuplu Bhattacharya: Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Chris, for my first question, I\u2019d like to add something which is a high level question. Some investors are concerned that we may be going into a recession in the U.S. because the rates are going up or we might see a slowdown in Europe because of the war there. So can you maybe talk to us about how CDW as a company is different from what it was in the 08, 09 timeframe? And do you think the company is better prepared now to face a downturn and in the same way, and you raise your guidance for the full year. Can you talk about what are some of the things that are giving you confidence to do that, given all of the macro and supply chain headwinds that are continuing? Thanks.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, good morning Ruplu and thanks for the comment. Let me start with the second part first with raising our, with feeding our confidence is what we\u2019re seeing with our customers. It\u2019s the demand. It\u2019s the momentum. It\u2019s the criticality of IT in every walk of every industry to drive competitive advantage, experience, etc. So we just see technology as absolutely central. And really it\u2019s an investment in innovation. It\u2019s no longer viewed as a cost to the business as much as an asset of innovation. And we\u2019re seeing that and feel very confident that that will continue, possibly at the expense of some other investments that organizations make. But technology is top of the list. As far as the macro environment, what might happen here\u2019s what I would tell you. First of all, we have our broad and deep portfolio is the best it\u2019s ever been at any point in time. Secondly, our flexible business model has allowed us, in any challenging time has allowed us to outperform the market and deliver results. And if you look actually at the Great Recession, we did outperform the market. And if you think about the last three years, significant delivery of great performance versus the market. So and in those cases, we also emerge stronger. So you\u2019ve got our portfolio which is better than it\u2019s ever been. You\u2019ve got our flexible business model which has a track record of working and having us deliver performance in downtime. And when you think about our value propositions the third thing, I would say the value proposition for our customers and our partners becomes even more important to them. They become even more reliant on our stability, on our scale on all the things that we deliver. And at the end of the day, that allows us to be opportunistic and helping them and gaining share in the market. So I point you to our track record and our model and our portfolio and our value proposition which has over 35 years, reflected the fact that CDW is a different company performs in tough times and in good times. And typically in tough times, we come out even stronger than when we enter them. \nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thanks for all the details there Chris. Maybe for my follow up. If you can talk a little bit about the government segment. It was good to see revenues grow 5% year-on-year after several you\u2019ve been facing tough comps and several quarters of year-on declines. Last year, you talked about some projects that were delayed. You think those come back in the first half and you think government revenues can continue to grow year-on-year over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yes. No problem on the government side, the federal side we\u2019ve been saying now for a couple of quarters that we expect growth to see growth in the second half of the year and that expectation has not changed. So the projects, we\u2019ve talked about the green shoots we\u2019ve talked about, we expect to be taking hold in the second half of this year as expected. As far as state and local that\u2019s playing out as we thought it would as well, if you remember, the funding was coming in a multiyear fashion. The federal funding and that was extending customer\u2019s buying patterns a bit. And we\u2019ve been really helping them on the planning phase of spending that those that funding federal funding and we\u2019re starting to see that come to fruition. And you see that in the results this quarter which is those projects starting to flow out now which is a very positive thing and reflective of what we expected to happen.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Congrats again on the quarter and on the strong guide. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question. \nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good morning. I thought I would just maybe start with a question on margins. If I remember right, when you close the Sirius acquisition, you talked about it adding just over 100 basis points to gross margin and about 20 basis points to operating margin based on 2020 numbers with no synergy assumption. We look at this quarter gross margin was up over 200 basis points. So double of that. But operating margin still up just about 20 basis points year-over-year. Maybe you could give it some color on the better mix on gross margin, the growth metrics being healthy overall, but seeing minimal leverage on the operating line. And I imagine you\u2019re going to talk about investments. So more specifics on the nature of those investments and expectation for return would be helpful? Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Sure, Adam and good morning. This is Al. So on gross margins for the quarter I would comment on two things certainly you had the impact from Sirius for the quarter and I would say that benefit was as expected. We had a couple of the things that benefited our gross margin for the quarter. Number one stronger netted down revenues actually grew two times the level of our sales, product margin mix and rate were strong. And so they were important components on the gross margin front. So down to your NGOI margin question. So yes, NGOI margin 20 basis points better than prior year and basis points better than prior quarter certainly had the benefit of Sirius. Just the one call out I would give you in terms of the accrued and benefits there for Sirius is that, given the seasonality of their business, Q1 is typically lower on the scale of the full year. And therefore some of the fixed cost leverage we get from Sirius is more on the latter half of the year. So that has a bit of a dilute effect for the quarter. But still we were able to turn in really strong 7.8 for the quarter. \nAdam Tindle: Understood and maybe as a follow up for Chris on backlog. You\u2019ve previously talked about feathering in over multiple quarters versus a big bang and one quarter. Just wondering if you could maybe revisit this since we saw such a strong quarter here on growth metrics. I think you did say remaining orders built in the quarter. So I just wanted to clarify that. And certainly any color on the size and composition of backlog today versus 90 days ago would be super helpful. Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, morning, Adam. I\u2019d say look in terms of backlog building it was in line with what we saw in Q4. So that would give you kind of characterizes the size. In terms of what we\u2019re seeing is a feathering out. So I think I said we were seeing pockets of improvement yet new pockets of pressure. So we\u2019ve seen notebooks free up a little bit. Chrome books free up a little bit over the course of time, but solutions, products really more constrained now than they were before in particular Netcom. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hearing that a lot. So look, we\u2019re in it. We still expect it feathering out. We\u2019re not seeing anything in our results, frankly, or in our conversations with partners that suggest anything than the way we\u2019ve already described it to you.\nAdam Tindle: Understood, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI. Amit your line is now open. Please ask your question. \nAmit Daryanani: Thanks. It\u2019s Amit Daryanani, just to be clear. Chris, I\u2019m hoping you could talk about the increased complexity of IT operation that especially with return to work. And this seems to be a sustained and acute labor shortage, especially in the skilled worker side. I\u2019m wondering if that combination of those two practices is resulting in fewer than seen that can stand expand and you suddenly see that you\u2019re engaging with more mid and even larger enterprises switching typically would in your industry as the AI using this enabled the PAM expansion? And what could that do to your growth rate is your forward? \nChristine Leahy: Yes, good morning Amit. In terms of the tech now, I want to make sure I could having trouble hearing you a little bit. But you were asking about PAM expansion due to servicing enterprise size customers and in particular technology talent supply shortages. Did I get that right?\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Essentially, yes. Given the labor shortages, IT is getting more complex. Are you getting pulled in by bigger enterprises that you typically wouldn\u2019t and does that span your time? Does that alter your growth rate?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, okay. I got. Fair question. Yes. Well, when you look at the couple of things you look at Sirius\u2019s customer segment. And it\u2019s heavily enterprise oriented. So yes, we are focusing on the enterprise. If you look at CDW\u2019s customers well, we have typically said our sweet spot is customers up to 5000 end users, we have a very large number of enterprise customers that we service and that service extremely well in the past five years, given the increase in complexity. So yes, we are in the enterprise space. We\u2019re continuing to grow in the enterprise space. We have not done the calculation regarding the TAM. But we certainly expect to be able to continue to be successful in that space now more than ever. It used to be you think about enterprise and one of the reasons they might not have turned to CDW was because they would have and could afford the technology talent within their organization to handle everything that they needed. But now given the speed and complexity, even the larger organizations can\u2019t keep up with the changing nature of technology and our ability to supplement and address that problem is really become a very interesting value proposition for those organizations. And boy, did we see it play out in the during the pandemic.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you. And then Al you talked about gross margins and some of the levers that lead to better performance in March. Can you start with the durability of these gross margins? Because I think you talked about mix getting better in the back of the year with more cloud and security. So could you run in the mid 18% to 19% gross margins for the remainder of the year, or what are the puts and takes moving forward?\nAl Miralles: Sure Amit. First, let\u2019s just start with our expectation or outlook of low 8% on NGOI margin. So that is what we guide on in that regard. But just back to your comment, your question on gross margin. Look, if we look at our strategy and the execution, I think that that has played out over time, in terms of expansion of our gross margin. I think this quarter is a great example of that really bring the power, all of that; strong net it down revenues, product margin was a factor, Sirius coming online. So a lot of those variables are playing out. We would anticipate that that would continue and particularly talked about the second half, we expect higher level of netted down revenues which certainly is the theme. So if you get back to that NGOI margin, we believe that execution of the strategy and follow through on that will deliver the outcomes we\u2019re expecting. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim, your line is now open. Please go ahead with your question. \nJim Suva: Thank you. And congratulations, Chris earlier in the call, you had mentioned that the supply situation largely hasn\u2019t changed from say 90 days ago when the investors last spoke to you on such a call. I wanted to ask though, if you dissect the end markets though, or I\u2019m sorry, not end markets, but end products, whether it be PCs or servers or computer devices. Have you seen some shifts there? Because there\u2019s been indications of things like Chrome books seeing actually a big deterioration, while maybe others seen higher demand? So I\u2019m wondering if you take it to the device level? Have you seen some material puts and takes and shifts?\nChristine Leahy: Yes Jim here is what I would say. I would characterize the supply environment as pockets of improvement and pockets of pressure. The pockets of improvement over the past several months has been in the notebook and Chrome book. The transactional side of our business. And the pockets of pressure have really showed up in the solution side. So we did see a shift, if you will. So we saw some feathering out on the client devices. And but we\u2019ve seen by backlog grow in the solution side of the business. And it\u2019s complex because the solution side what happens is if you\u2019re using an integrated solution, if you\u2019re missing one part of that, you can\u2019t get the software out if you don\u2019t have the hardware. So it gets pretty complex. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. And I think I mentioned also netcom was a particular networking is a particular area, a pressure area, I guess I would say within the solutions categories.\nJim Suva: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then as my follow up probably more appropriate for Al. Al when we think about cash flow and uses am I correct to kind of 2022 should be kind of a debt pay down here? Or is there sufficient cash flow, because component costs are going higher and high growth, that inventory will need to be cash flow consumed to support the inventory, or you guys looking at actually strategically adding in more software services, security skill sets to your portfolio. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Sure. Thanks, Jim. So first, just on the quarter free cash flow, we had a strong free cash flow quarter and above our rule of thumb. You\u2019ll recall prior quarter we were somewhat below that rule of thumb. And so I would just note to you, we\u2019re seeing some variability in environment. And some of that Jim is a function of us making those investments and really leveraging our working capital. For the full year we still expect to be within our rule of thumb for free cash flow, albeit there may be some variability quarter-to-quarter. All of that intended really to go to number one, our capital priority of dividend payment and then two debt repayment. And I will note that for the quarter, we had pretty meaningful repayment of our debt. And we got our net leverage down from 3.4 to 3.1. And our expectation is we\u2019ll continue to make that a priority. And our goal is to get back in our net leverage range for the full year by the end of the year. \nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details Chris and Al. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. Al hopefully, we\u2019ll have more color on the 23% growth, I understand was a good, very good quarter for demand. But can you provide a bit more breakdown between the three different elements, which I think I\u2019m hearing is this Sirius growth in the volume and growth in price increases. Can you provide a context about the contributions of each? \nAl Miralles: Yes. Sure, Keith. Happy to weigh in, Chris may have something on the back end of that. So 23% is the all in as we mentioned, prior quarter focuses on integrating the companies and just the nature of integrating our sales. We\u2019re looking at it on combined basis, so that 23% is inclusive of Sirius. And I would just note, notwithstanding my comment about seasonality of Sirius business is operating as expected, and things are moving a pace on the integration. Otherwise, I would just point back to our comments about in channels and contribution as well as product portfolio. And I\u2019d say, for the quarter, we fired on all cylinders, and really contributions came from many of the key spots in the investment areas that we\u2019ve been focused on.\nChristine Leahy: Hi Keith, and its Chris just to add on to what Al said I think he really coined it with hitting on all cylinders. So the business is hitting on all cylinders, the customer end markets, the portfolio and the integration. I know you have to question about integration. I guess, what I would say is number one, serious, the integration is going outstanding. I could not be more pleased with the pace and with the results. And also with the execution in the marketplace. As we said last quarter, we\u2019re really, really focused on integrating the businesses and bringing them together and going to market as one CDW and not really parsing out dollars and assigning creditors, as we\u2019d like to say. So I would just tell you that it\u2019s going great. Our focus, this first quarter has been all about our customers and our partners and our coworkers in particular, and creating the roadmaps and the support and the tools they need to be successful. And at the end of the day I think we said a couple quarters ago, we expect one plus one equal more than two, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing that is making us doubt that. We\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re bringing to the market, and in particular excited about how our customers are responding to the value add in the combined entity.\nKeith Housum: Okay. I appreciate that. It is a follow up to that in terms of like the turnover of the coworkers and I guess the inflationary environment. Can you guys provide a little bit of color in terms of how is the turnover of the coworker right now and in terms of compared to prior years? And then in terms of what you guys are forced to do in terms of salary adjustments perhaps the impact that will have on operating expenses?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Keith a great question. And we\u2019re facing the same tight labor market that everybody does. The good news is we\u2019ve been an employer of choice for a very long time. And we\u2019ve focused on investing in our coworkers since our founding, and so the unique environment, the unique culture is a real draw for coworkers, the ability to grow one\u2019s career, the interesting work we do, that all is important, as important as compensation to coworkers staying with CDW. We\u2019ve seen some tick up a little bit of a hiccup in attrition in certain pockets of the CDW, but nothing that I would say is kind of worth noting. We\u2019re working harder to bring in the talent. It takes a little longer to get new talent in. But we\u2019re, of course very focused on keeping our talent and that potential for attrition. In terms of the costs and adjustments to our compensation. Look, again, we think about total rewards to coworkers and that includes the work. the people, the benefits, everything combined, and not just the compensation, per se. So we haven\u2019t had to make major adjustments. And then don\u2019t forget that the largest section of our organization is variable comp. And so it\u2019s all about driving growth and the more growth they drive the more they make, and as you can see from our results, we should have a pretty happy team.\nKeith Housum: Got it. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you very much. We have no further questions. [Operator Instructions] Yes. And there\u2019s no further question. So I\u2019d like to hand back to Chris, the CEO for closing remarks.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you, Daniel. I appreciate it and appreciate your time today. I just want to emphasize that CDW has never been more well positioned to support our customers in a fast paced and changing technology environment. We\u2019re very excited about the future. So I want to close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our more than 14,000 coworkers around the globe. It is their ongoing dedication to serving our customers, which is key and will continue to be key to profitably outperforming the IT market going forward. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for the time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you all next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christine Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I will begin today's call with a brief overview of our results, strategic progress and outlook and Al will run through the financials and our capital allocation priorities. And then we'll move right to your questions. We had an outstanding start to the year. The team's continued to execute well in a challenging supply environment and delivered exceptional top line growth and profitability. For the first quarter net sales were $5.9 billion, 23% higher than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $462 million up 26% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.20 up 26% on a reported basis. These exceptional results reflect our ability to address customer priorities with solutions across the full spectrum of IT and the inclusion of Sirius. Customers continue to evolve as we move ahead into the new normal. Digital transformation, agility and security remained top concerns with return to office driving collaboration, networking and endpoint solutions. Customers want to manage costs while meeting or exceeding coworker and customer service level requirements. At the same time, customers across our diverse and markets are seeking ways to supplement technology resources in today's war for talent environment. Our ability to meet all these needs led to a broad based and balanced performance. There were three drivers of our performance during the quarter. The first driver with our broad and diverse portfolio of customer end markets, as you know we have five U.S. sales channels; corporate small business, health care, government and education. Each of these channels is a meaningful business on its own, with 2021 annual sales ranging from $1.8 billion to over $6 billion. Within each channel teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. We also have our UK and Canadian operations, which together deliver $2.6 billion U.S. in 2021 sales. This scale and balance across customer and markets positions us to perform when external factors impact certain sectors or geographies. This quarter our commercial markets, corporate and small business, along with our healthcare and international markets all delivered strong double digit growth. As expected education and government growth was depressed as they left strong prior year stimulus and large deal driven results. Our corporate team delivered a 46% increase. Growth was strong and balanced across transactions and solutions. The team did an excellent job addressing customer demand for return to Work solutions, digital transformation and the need for agility and security. Unit growth coupled with ASP increases resulted in another quarter of strong double digit growth in client devices and cloud spend was excellent. Small business posted a 21% increase performance was broad based across both transactions and solutions. Return to office strategy and modernizing workspaces drove strong collaboration, networking and security growth for hybrid work environments. Remote enablement drove another strong quarter of client device growth up double digits both in unit and ASPs. Security performance was up mid teens and cloud spend was robust. Public posted a 6% increase on top of last year's exceptional 20% plus growth. Healthcare increased 27%. Ongoing focus on driving productivity to offset higher costs from staffing shortages and other acute care needs lead to double digit solutions growth. Cloud adoption was strong driven by the speed and efficiency cloud solutions can deliver. Government posted a mid single digit increase. State and local delivered a high single digit increase driven by client devices and security. As we shared last quarter, we continue to help our customers as they work through the various funding opportunities and multiyear phasing and expect projects to continue to be implemented as we move through 2022. Federal performance played out as expected and was balanced across both the department of defense and civilian while lapping tough compares. As we shared last quarter, we continue to experience the lumpy nature of government contracts and contracting changes. There is no change to our expectation that growth will return later in the year.  Higher ed strong double digit performance was offset by the expected decline in K-12 and overall education sales decreased 4% off the first quarter of 2021 remarkable 101% growth. The higher ed team continues to help customers implement student success programs using technology to give an institution an edge with comprehensive endpoint solutions, improve security, campus connectivity and enhanced dorm room experiences. The team delivered excellent client device growth and school systems tapped our capabilities to address the war for technology talent which drove increased usage of CDW services to fill the gap in staffing needs. While K-12 delivered strong non-seasonal results they posted a year-over-year decline on top of last year's exceptional 100% growth. Emergency connectivity funding which was expected to end during the first half of 2022 was extended and a third wave was announced adding complexity to an already challenging process. Many school systems are leveraging the extended funding window to digest better options and plans for their IT spend. Other our combined UK and Canada results increased 13% on a reported basis. UK grew double digits in local currency and Canada increased high single digits in local currency. Each market saw balanced strength across both commercial and public customers. Customer priorities remain similar to those in the U.S. The second driver of first quarter performance with our broad and deep product and solutions portfolio. Our ability to address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum drove excellent performance across both our solutions and transactions portfolios. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages including our distribution centers, extensive logistic capabilities, deep vendor partner relationships, and strong balance sheet and liquidity position to navigate an ongoing supply challenge. U.S. hardware increased high teens. Growth was broad based and included double digit increases in net cash on servers and server management, client devices, and video/audio. This exceptional performance was on top of 2020 one's first quarter double digit high hardware growth. Demand continued to outpace supply in several key areas, notably in the networking space, and remaining orders built during the quarter. Customers once again placed orders to get in line for second half 2022 projects, especially in Netcom. U.S. software posted a 40% increase driven by success helping customers upgrade their edge and secure their IT environments with double digit increases network management software and security software. Cloud was a meaningful contributor to this quarter strong performance with significant double digit increases in customer spend and gross profit led by productivity, platform, security and collaboration workloads. U.S. services sales doubled. Growth was broad based and balanced, driven by professional services, managed services and warranties. As you can see excellent, broad and balanced performance across the business. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter; our customer and coworker centric strategy. Over the past three years, we have executed against our strategy to enhance our high relevant and high growth solutions and services with both organic and inorganic investments. Eight acquisitions have deepened and advanced our services capabilities including automation, cloud native and DevOps, cyber security, and our services scale and reach. We welcomed nearly 3,000 new coworkers from these eight acquisitions with more than half and technical rules. Since year end 2018 our technical team has doubled in size, and at the end of this first quarter was more than 5,000 strong. Today, technical coworkers comprise more than half of all customer facing coworkers. Together with their other CDW colleagues, they form an amazing high performing team; a high performing team that is a key competitive advantage for CDW, a team that is the most engaged enabled and energize team in the industry. All our investments whether homegrown or inorganic, are intended to maximize our key point of differentiation in the marketplace. We are a one stop trusted partner with capabilities across the entire continuum of IT. Capabilities that help customers achieve the outcomes they need from technology so they can do great things. Let me share a couple of recent customer examples that demonstrate how our investments help customers achieve outcomes. A soft drink manufacturer wanted to upgrade their on-premise voice system. The customer had two desired outcomes for the solution. Number one flexibility to expand as their business grew. And number two an excellent user experience. Since IT staff was focused on other priorities, the solution needed to be managed off-premise. Leveraging CDW is world class unified communications as a service capability and ServiceNow capabilities the team designed a flexible and cost competitive, integrated full stack managed collaboration anywhere solution. The solution included CDW professional services for upfront design, planning, configuration and deployment and CDW managed services to provide ongoing MCA support and integration with our ServiceNow ticketing platform. A great outcome for the customer and for the team who bested large telecom providers to win the deal. They also deepen their relationship with the customer and delivered more than 3 million in licensing and services revenues. The second example of how our investments enable customers to achieve the outcomes they need is the recent adoption of Focal Point Academy by a major technology company. Focal Point Academy is a bespoke training program that delivers workforce development programs that solve today's greatest cyber security problems; finding training and retaining skilled cyber professionals. Focal Point Academy operationally focused portfolio which covers high demand topics like threat hunting and application security, coupled with its ability to train and develop both senior and junior technical professionals was exactly what the customer needed to achieve its desired outcome of mitigating risk. Prior to our acquisition of focal point, we would not have been able to deliver this important global solution and further deepen our relationship with the customer. Investments in our customer and coworker centric growth strategy are integral to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market. And that leads to our expectations for the rest of the year. During the balance of 2022, we will continue to execute against our strategy to deepen our services and solutions capabilities. We are making excellent integration progress with Sirius and that will remain a key focus area for the balance of 2022 as will investments in our coworkers and our own digital transformation. We will continue to balance investments with our growth and profitability expectations which are now higher than previously shared at year end. Given our excellent momentum coming into the second quarter and first quarter performance, we now expect to outperform the U.S. IT market by 325 to 425 basis points, 125 basis points higher than our view at year end 2021. Our view of U.S. IT market growth has also increased and we now look for 2022 growth of 4% which is 50 basis points above our prior view. Taken together this equates to constant certain constant currency growth of seven and a quarter to eight and a quarter percent above 2021 combined CDW revenues of $22.8 billion. Recall 2021 combined CDW is calculated as those Sirius had been acquired on January 1, 2021 instead of its actual acquisition date of December 1 since our outlook represents a 17.5% to 18.5% increase over 2021 results. This outlook reflects our baseline expectations that given 2021 second half strong hardware performance, we will mix into more cloud and security in the back half of this year. It also reflects our expectation that supply constraints remain relatively consistent with the first half of the year. As always, we remain mindful of our wildcards, the potential for further disruption to the supply chain, changes in COVID, or macro economic performance and we will keep a watchful eye on these and other potential issues. As we always do, we will provide an update on our view on our next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best which is leverage our competitive advantages and out execute the competition. We will also continue to invest to ensure we remain our customers trusted partner who delivers the outcomes they need whether for innovation, cost management, agility, risk mitigation or user experience. If the past two years have shown us anything it is that our role as a trusted strategic partner to our customers is more important now than ever. Let me turn it over to Al now who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Yes. Good morning Matt. It's Chris. Yes what we are seeing is customers across our commercial segments, kind of as we mentioned last time getting on with it meaning living within the current environment and making decisions about their back to work strategy, which means they're bolstering their capabilities in offices. They are bolstering their capability in home environments, because they're really focused on their co-workers ability to be productive, and deliver seamlessly moving from remote to in office. And as we expected, we continue to see very strong endpoint solution performance this quarter. And we're also seeing what usually, typically follows that and what was delayed a bit over the last couple of years which is an investment in the hybrid infrastructure to support all the needs of the coworkers and the expectations both at the workload and application level and everything required to create a stronger and more robust infrastructure for those devices. So we will continue to see those two dynamics play out through the course of the year would be our views. It's different in different segments, but in the current commercial segment, for sure, we'll continue to see that. Yes, Matt so I think about it, the extension in the new, the little bit of an added round of funding for ECF just is timing. So it gave the schools a little bit of a breather to reflect on their planning and not be rushed to buy. So that's just an extension. So we'll see that play out over the next 18 months. At the same time schools are working very hard on ensuring that they don't lose ground in what they're trying to do which is teach students and learn. And so when you think about the dynamics of the classroom and the infrastructure needs to support the classroom including audio, visual, interactive monitors, and kind of the new generation of the classroom, we're starting to already help our customers with that. So look, we look at this as a kind of steady ed long term growth opportunity for CDW at every time there's been an inflection point in K through 12, in the classroom learning space, CDW has been at the absolute tip of the spear and helping customers get there. And we've seen growth as a result. Yes, I guess, what word would I use? I think I'd say kind of unchanged. Meaning we're not seeing a lot of change in the challenges that we're all facing. When we think about the supply chain environment, I'd say two things. Number one, it's an opportunity. But it's also frustrating. It's an opportunity for CDW because we know what's happening, we have more visibility with our partners, I think, than anybody. When you think about our competitive advantages, our ability to take on inventory to support our customers with our balance sheet, having the distribution logistics capabilities, that's put us in a great position to manage the supply chain issues, I think, again, better than anybody in the market. But it's frustrating for customers. And we're helping customers get through that, because we can help them choose alternatives, which they're a little more open minded now to which we have a pretty good path to get to. But the short answer is supply chain is what it is. And it's not getting better. It's not getting worse, some pockets are getting better, some pockets are getting more difficult. But net-net, we're going to be living with this through 2022 if not into 2023. And again, it's a matter of who manages it the best and I think we're doing a really good job of that. Yes, no, Erik, it's a fair question. Look, its CDW's typical approach, which is we'll call it when we're ready to call it and when we think we have a good visibility. And it's just too early to call that in the back half of the year right now. But that said outstanding start to the year as you know, and we see absolutely excellent momentum going into Q2 and expect what a robust 20% profit growth in the second half of 2022. So we look at this and see a really aggressive but achievable goal in front of us. So we're feeling very optimistic about the year and what we'll call the back half of the year when we get a little closer in the back half of the year. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Yes, so let me start with the last past part first, which is our premium to market. And we when we look at the areas that we've outperformed in Q1 let's take notebook overall solutions. Several areas where we just our view is look, we're really outperforming the market, it's pretty clear. So that goes into the premium. In terms of whether or not Sirius is contributing, here's how I think about it on a combined basis we're responding to customer needs in the current environment and seeing healthy business across both the underlying and Sirius segments. In terms of the underlying IT industry, yes, we brought that up, because we're starting to feel real momentum in the business, the demand is there, the writings there. So it just feels to us, like the market is growing a little faster than we would have thought at the beginning of the year. So the IT market generally is kind of the written in demand that we're seeing. The premium is the categories that we're delivering in and looking at what we triangulate the growth rates to be in the market, we just think we're outperforming by a wide margin. Yes we are, look, pricing continues to be fairly dynamic and fluid, I guess I'd say. And we are continuing to see pricing increases, given what's happening out in the macro environment that said we are a cost plus model, as you know, and we are not seeing constraints in IT budgets, our customers are still buying, they're not cutting it budgets because of pricing. And as I think I mentioned our prepared remarks, we're seeing some of the growth kind of split between unit increases and ASP increases. So they're both contributing to growth across the board, really. Yes, good morning Ruplu and thanks for the comment. Let me start with the second part first with raising our, with feeding our confidence is what we're seeing with our customers. It's the demand. It's the momentum. It's the criticality of IT in every walk of every industry to drive competitive advantage, experience, etc. So we just see technology as absolutely central. And really it's an investment in innovation. It's no longer viewed as a cost to the business as much as an asset of innovation. And we're seeing that and feel very confident that that will continue, possibly at the expense of some other investments that organizations make. But technology is top of the list. As far as the macro environment, what might happen here's what I would tell you. First of all, we have our broad and deep portfolio is the best it's ever been at any point in time. Secondly, our flexible business model has allowed us, in any challenging time has allowed us to outperform the market and deliver results. And if you look actually at the Great Recession, we did outperform the market. And if you think about the last three years, significant delivery of great performance versus the market. So and in those cases, we also emerge stronger. So you've got our portfolio which is better than it's ever been. You've got our flexible business model which has a track record of working and having us deliver performance in downtime. And when you think about our value propositions the third thing, I would say the value proposition for our customers and our partners becomes even more important to them. They become even more reliant on our stability, on our scale on all the things that we deliver. And at the end of the day, that allows us to be opportunistic and helping them and gaining share in the market. So I point you to our track record and our model and our portfolio and our value proposition which has over 35 years, reflected the fact that CDW is a different company performs in tough times and in good times. And typically in tough times, we come out even stronger than when we enter them. Yes. No problem on the government side, the federal side we've been saying now for a couple of quarters that we expect growth to see growth in the second half of the year and that expectation has not changed. So the projects, we've talked about the green shoots we've talked about, we expect to be taking hold in the second half of this year as expected. As far as state and local that's playing out as we thought it would as well, if you remember, the funding was coming in a multiyear fashion. The federal funding and that was extending customer's buying patterns a bit. And we've been really helping them on the planning phase of spending that those that funding federal funding and we're starting to see that come to fruition. And you see that in the results this quarter which is those projects starting to flow out now which is a very positive thing and reflective of what we expected to happen. Yes, morning, Adam. I'd say look in terms of backlog building it was in line with what we saw in Q4. So that would give you kind of characterizes the size. In terms of what we're seeing is a feathering out. So I think I said we were seeing pockets of improvement yet new pockets of pressure. So we've seen notebooks free up a little bit. Chrome books free up a little bit over the course of time, but solutions, products really more constrained now than they were before in particular Netcom. And I'm sure you're hearing that a lot. So look, we're in it. We still expect it feathering out. We're not seeing anything in our results, frankly, or in our conversations with partners that suggest anything than the way we've already described it to you. Yes, good morning Amit. In terms of the tech now, I want to make sure I could having trouble hearing you a little bit. But you were asking about PAM expansion due to servicing enterprise size customers and in particular technology talent supply shortages. Did I get that right? Yes, okay. I got. Fair question. Yes. Well, when you look at the couple of things you look at Sirius's customer segment. And it's heavily enterprise oriented. So yes, we are focusing on the enterprise. If you look at CDW's customers well, we have typically said our sweet spot is customers up to 5000 end users, we have a very large number of enterprise customers that we service and that service extremely well in the past five years, given the increase in complexity. So yes, we are in the enterprise space. We're continuing to grow in the enterprise space. We have not done the calculation regarding the TAM. But we certainly expect to be able to continue to be successful in that space now more than ever. It used to be you think about enterprise and one of the reasons they might not have turned to CDW was because they would have and could afford the technology talent within their organization to handle everything that they needed. But now given the speed and complexity, even the larger organizations can't keep up with the changing nature of technology and our ability to supplement and address that problem is really become a very interesting value proposition for those organizations. And boy, did we see it play out in the during the pandemic. Yes Jim here is what I would say. I would characterize the supply environment as pockets of improvement and pockets of pressure. The pockets of improvement over the past several months has been in the notebook and Chrome book. The transactional side of our business. And the pockets of pressure have really showed up in the solution side. So we did see a shift, if you will. So we saw some feathering out on the client devices. And but we've seen by backlog grow in the solution side of the business. And it's complex because the solution side what happens is if you're using an integrated solution, if you're missing one part of that, you can't get the software out if you don't have the hardware. So it gets pretty complex. So that's what we're seeing. And I think I mentioned also netcom was a particular networking is a particular area, a pressure area, I guess I would say within the solutions categories. Hi Keith, and its Chris just to add on to what Al said I think he really coined it with hitting on all cylinders. So the business is hitting on all cylinders, the customer end markets, the portfolio and the integration. I know you have to question about integration. I guess, what I would say is number one, serious, the integration is going outstanding. I could not be more pleased with the pace and with the results. And also with the execution in the marketplace. As we said last quarter, we're really, really focused on integrating the businesses and bringing them together and going to market as one CDW and not really parsing out dollars and assigning creditors, as we'd like to say. So I would just tell you that it's going great. Our focus, this first quarter has been all about our customers and our partners and our coworkers in particular, and creating the roadmaps and the support and the tools they need to be successful. And at the end of the day I think we said a couple quarters ago, we expect one plus one equal more than two, and there's absolutely nothing that is making us doubt that. We're very excited about what we're bringing to the market, and in particular excited about how our customers are responding to the value add in the combined entity. Yes. Keith a great question. And we're facing the same tight labor market that everybody does. The good news is we've been an employer of choice for a very long time. And we've focused on investing in our coworkers since our founding, and so the unique environment, the unique culture is a real draw for coworkers, the ability to grow one's career, the interesting work we do, that all is important, as important as compensation to coworkers staying with CDW. We've seen some tick up a little bit of a hiccup in attrition in certain pockets of the CDW, but nothing that I would say is kind of worth noting. We're working harder to bring in the talent. It takes a little longer to get new talent in. But we're, of course very focused on keeping our talent and that potential for attrition. In terms of the costs and adjustments to our compensation. Look, again, we think about total rewards to coworkers and that includes the work. the people, the benefits, everything combined, and not just the compensation, per se. So we haven't had to make major adjustments. And then don't forget that the largest section of our organization is variable comp. And so it's all about driving growth and the more growth they drive the more they make, and as you can see from our results, we should have a pretty happy team. Thank you, Daniel. I appreciate it and appreciate your time today. I just want to emphasize that CDW has never been more well positioned to support our customers in a fast paced and changing technology environment. We're very excited about the future. So I want to close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our more than 14,000 coworkers around the globe. It is their ongoing dedication to serving our customers, which is key and will continue to be key to profitably outperforming the IT market going forward. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for the time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you all next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with more detail on the first quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with their 2022 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on slide 8 consolidated net sales are $5.9 billion up 23% on a reported and average daily sales basis in constant currency. On an average daily sales basis sequential sales increased 7.4% versus the fourth quarter which is well above historical average sequential decline of 5%. This reflected two primary factors; first demand for return to work and remote enablement solutions remain strong and drove sequential growth in our commercial channels, and international. As Chris mentioned, corporate and small business had broad based and balanced growth across both transactions and solutions. Second, Q1 reported results reflected three months of contribution from Sirius versus one month in Q4. Notwithstanding that Sirius is first quarter has historically been the lowest quarter of absolute sales and gross profit dollars for the business. On the supply side, our overall backlog increased in Q1 at a similar level to the fourth quarter remain elevated year-over-year in both transactional and solution categories. We continue to make strategic investments and inventory to support our customers through this constrained supply environment and the team once again did a great job leveraging CDW's competitive advantage to ensure strong returns on working capital. Gross profit for the quarter was $1.1 million a year-over-year increase of 38.8%. Netted down revenues grew faster than the underlying business represented nearly 31% of total gross profit more than three points over the last year. A higher mix of net service contract revenue, primarily within Software as a Service, favorable product mix and rate and increase net sales and margin on professional services combined to deliver a record gross margin of 18.6% up 220 basis points versus last year. Turning to SG&A on slide 9 non-GAAP SG&A totaled $642 million for the quarter. Year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher payroll as a result of the increase coworkers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was 14,005 up over 3800 from prior year quarter reflecting organic and inorganic investments in coworkers that support high growth solution areas and our own digital transformation. Recall that Sirius as payroll as a percentage of net sales is higher than our core operations given their higher mix of solutions and services revenues. And this ratio is historically highest in the first quarter due to sale seasonality. The higher level of SG&A also reflects continued investments in the training and development of coworkers, return to office efforts and investment in our own digital transformation and technology strategy. As Chris mentioned, we will continue to balance investment with their growth and profitability expectations. Investments in our strategy are integral to our ability to outgrow the market profitably and sustainably. GAAP operating income was $387 million up 19.6%. Non-GAAP operating income was $462 million up 25.7% and non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.8% up 20 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points from Q4. Moving to slide 10, interest expense was $56 million. Higher interest expense is primarily driven by the senior notes issued last year to fund the acquisition of Sirius. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on slide 11 was 24.3%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $80 million. To get our non-GAAP effective tax rate we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add backs, as shown on slide 12. For the for quarter our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.7% up 50 basis points versus last year's rate primarily driven by higher state taxes as well as taxes on foreign earnings. As you can see on slide 13, with first quarter weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 137 million, GAAP net income per share was $1.83. Our non-GAAP net income was $302 million in the quarter up 21%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $2.20 up 27% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet on slide 14, at March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $387 million and net debt was $6.2 billion. Liquidity remain strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to slide 15, a three month average cash conversion cycle is 20 days down two days from last year's first quarter, reflecting the impact of the Sirius acquisition. Free cash flow for the quarter was $466 million, as shown on slide 16. This is higher than a typical first quarter reflecting strong growth in the business and effective working capital management. For the quarter we deployed cash consistent with our 2022 capital allocation objectives of paying dividends and paying down debt including $67 million of dividends and $260 million in debt repayments. Turning to capital allocation on slide 17, our objectives remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. First, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November we increased the dividend 25% to $2 annually. To guide future increases we will continue to target the dividend at approximately 25% of non-GAAP net income and to grow in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times. We ended the quarter at 3.1 times down from 3.4 times at the end of 2021 demonstrating strong cash generation and progress towards returning to our targeted net leverage ratio. We continue to expect to achieve this by the end of 2022. While we continue to temporarily put a lower priority on our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases until net leverage is in our target range we are on a path to delivering on these priorities. Moving to the outlook for 2022 on slide 18, starting with sales. As Chris mentioned, the first quarter was a great start to the year. We have excellent momentum entering Q2. We are cognizant of potential market variables as we look further out. Recall that on a combined basis, CDW's net sales would have been $22.8 billion in 2021 from Sirius. With that in mind our updated outlook for the full year 2022 is now us it market growth of 4% plus 325 to 425 basis points of CDW outperformance in constant currency on a combined basis. On a reported basis, our full year net sales outlook equates to approximately 17.5% to 18.5% growth in constant currency. A baseline outlook assumes that supply does not materially impact net sales beyond what we've been experiencing. We would expect to be at the lower end of our premium range, we mix more in the netted down revenue streams than expected and/or experienced elevated levels of supply constraints. We bet the higher end of hardware growth is stronger and supply improves. Our outlook also assumes neutral currency impact for the full year. Moving down the P&L, we continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low 8% range. Our non-GAAP earnings per share recall that 2021 would have been $8.49 per share on a full year combined basis compared to a reported $7.97 per share, which includes only one month of Sirius. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share growth to be approximately 13% plus or minus 50 basis points in constant currency and on a combined basis. This equates to low 20% full year growth in constant currency on a reported basis. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on an annual constant currency basis. Slide 19 provides additional modeling thoughts, including our updated net sales split for the year. We now expect the first half of the year to be approximately 25 basis points above the high end of our historic norm of 48% to 49%. This reflects our over performance in the first quarter and strong momentum coming into Q2. It also reflects that it's too early to update our expectations for the second half of the year. We continue to expect the back half of the year reflecting greater mix and netted down revenues as we overlap 2021 strong client device sales. Recall that the accounting treatment for netted down revenues has a dampening effect on our absolute net sales dollars but is neutral to gross profit dollars and thus results in higher gross margins all else equal. Our expectations for the first half split, a low single digit sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis, this equates to close to 20% year-over-year reported net sales growth in the second quarter, which is roughly 230 basis points above our Q2 implied growth rate expectations from last quarter. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to grow in line with the second quarter reported sales. Finally, as you know timing has a meaningful impact on free cash flow. It may ebb and flow by quarter, but over the content continuum. We continue to expect to be within our long term free cash flow rule of thumb of three and three quarters to four and a quarter percent of net sales, assuming current tax rates. That concludes the financial summary. As we always do, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. And can we please ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you. Two things I would just add in and I am more, one thing we see in the supply environment is more creativity and agility, both ourselves and with our partners in terms of where do we pivot to different products, where do we pivot to different solutions and finding customers are accommodating that working with us to try to get to their solutions sooner than later. So that certainly had a bit of an impact from a mix and rate perspective. So just I would note that. Sure, Adam and good morning. This is Al. So on gross margins for the quarter I would comment on two things certainly you had the impact from Sirius for the quarter and I would say that benefit was as expected. We had a couple of the things that benefited our gross margin for the quarter. Number one stronger netted down revenues actually grew two times the level of our sales, product margin mix and rate were strong. And so they were important components on the gross margin front. So down to your NGOI margin question. So yes, NGOI margin 20 basis points better than prior year and basis points better than prior quarter certainly had the benefit of Sirius. Just the one call out I would give you in terms of the accrued and benefits there for Sirius is that, given the seasonality of their business, Q1 is typically lower on the scale of the full year. And therefore some of the fixed cost leverage we get from Sirius is more on the latter half of the year. So that has a bit of a dilute effect for the quarter. But still we were able to turn in really strong 7.8 for the quarter. Sure Amit. First, let's just start with our expectation or outlook of low 8% on NGOI margin. So that is what we guide on in that regard. But just back to your comment, your question on gross margin. Look, if we look at our strategy and the execution, I think that that has played out over time, in terms of expansion of our gross margin. I think this quarter is a great example of that really bring the power, all of that; strong net it down revenues, product margin was a factor, Sirius coming online. So a lot of those variables are playing out. We would anticipate that that would continue and particularly talked about the second half, we expect higher level of netted down revenues which certainly is the theme. So if you get back to that NGOI margin, we believe that execution of the strategy and follow through on that will deliver the outcomes we're expecting. Sure. Thanks, Jim. So first, just on the quarter free cash flow, we had a strong free cash flow quarter and above our rule of thumb. You'll recall prior quarter we were somewhat below that rule of thumb. And so I would just note to you, we're seeing some variability in environment. And some of that Jim is a function of us making those investments and really leveraging our working capital. For the full year we still expect to be within our rule of thumb for free cash flow, albeit there may be some variability quarter-to-quarter. All of that intended really to go to number one, our capital priority of dividend payment and then two debt repayment. And I will note that for the quarter, we had pretty meaningful repayment of our debt. And we got our net leverage down from 3.4 to 3.1. And our expectation is we'll continue to make that a priority. And our goal is to get back in our net leverage range for the full year by the end of the year. Yes. Sure, Keith. Happy to weigh in, Chris may have something on the back end of that. So 23% is the all in as we mentioned, prior quarter focuses on integrating the companies and just the nature of integrating our sales. We're looking at it on combined basis, so that 23% is inclusive of Sirius. And I would just note, notwithstanding my comment about seasonality of Sirius business is operating as expected, and things are moving a pace on the integration. Otherwise, I would just point back to our comments about in channels and contribution as well as product portfolio. And I'd say, for the quarter, we fired on all cylinders, and really contributions came from many of the key spots in the investment areas that we've been focused on."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2024. Then I will hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as always to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Fourth quarter net sales were $5 billion, 7.7% below 2022. Strong growth and operating income margins mitigated the impact of top-line performance on profits, and we delivered gross profit of $1.15 billion, 2% lower year-over-year, non-GAAP operating income of $519 million, 1% below prior year, and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.50, up 3% year-over-year. Our results reflect consistent, strong execution by the team, our financial rigor, and our ability to deliver solutions and services across the full life cycle, full stack. Results delivered under uneven commercial and international market conditions, which continue to drive cautious customer behavior. Customer priorities remained laser-focused on operating efficiency and expense elasticity. Priorities increasingly met by as-a-service and consumption-based solutions like cloud and SaaS, as well as nascent, ratable, on-premise solutions. The team's ability to pivot to address these priorities drove excellent performance across solutions, including categories that commonly net down on a revenue basis. The impact of this success, combined with ongoing softness in traditional hardware categories, resulted in further pressure on net sales. When this happens, we experience what we saw this quarter, meaningfully dampened net sales growth with very strong gross margins. This phenomenon was not unique to the fourth quarter. Market dynamics drove hardware deprioritization and preference for solutions that net down throughout 2023, and our net sales of $21 billion were over $2 billion less than 2022. Notwithstanding our muted top lines, strong execution by the team underpinned by our full stack, full lifecycle, full outcomes, go-to-market approach delivered flat, non-GAAP operating income, a 1% increase in non-GAAP net income per share, and strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion. Outcomes driven by the strategic investments we have made over the past five years to increase the value we deliver to our customers. That is the power of our strategy when combined with our resilient business model. 2023 was a year that truly pressure tested our strategy. The fourth quarter is an exemplary example of this inaction. There were three main drivers of results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio, and relentless execution of our three-part strategy for growth. First, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government, and education. Each channel is a meaningful billion-dollar-plus business on its own. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together deliver sales of US$2.6 billion. Often, our customer end markets perform differently given macroeconomic or industry-specific headwinds or tailwinds. This quarter, all but one customer end market experienced a decline in net sales. The profit story was very different, with gross margin increasing across all customer end markets. Let's take a look at the puts and takes of how each end market performed in the quarter. Corporate net sales decreased 8%. Top-line performance continued to reflect the impact of both netting down and hardware pressure. Momentum remained for projects focused on increasing productivity, as well as projects focused on enhanced customer and co-worker experiences. The team's ability to meet customer demand for these priorities with as-a-service and ratable solutions drove strong cloud performance. Year-over-year client device declines moderated down mid-single digits compared to the double-digit declines of the first three quarters. For netcomm, while network modernization stayed a top priority, customers focused on digesting investments made over the past few years, leading to a long-expected backlog of normalization, and sales declined year-over-year. Small business net sales declined 13%. Market conditions were consistent with the first three quarters of the year, and customer behavior remained cautious. Priorities remained squarely focused on cost management and projects that need to get done. Once again, projects that were more launched than needs remained paused. Customer demand for projects with shorter-term return on investment drove excellent performance in cloud and in total security -- total software, excuse me. Security remained a top priority, and the team delivered strong performance across our broad portfolio of hardware, software, and services security offerings. Similar to corporate, small business client device declines moderated in the quarter, down-high single digits compared to the prior three quarters double-digit decline. Public sales decreased 4% year-over-year as government's mid-single-digit net sales increase was more than offset by declines across our other public-ed markets. The federal team delivered a double-digit net sales increase as they continued their success helping agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This drove excellent netcomm performance up strong double digits. The team continued its efforts to help agencies optimize their existing cloud environments as well as deliver new cloud solutions. The state and local team delivered a mid-single-digit increase. The team's success-enabling cloud-based solutions, especially with budget constrained cities, delivered a triple-digit increase in cloud performance. For the second quarter in a row, the team delivered sales growth in client devices. Healthcare net sales decreased by 5%, augmenting talent needs, modernizing data centers, driving cost savings and efficiency projects, all remained focus areas for our customers. The team drove a significant increase in cloud performance. Growth driven by their success-helping systems adopt deep cloud portfolio, which includes proprietary healthcare solutions. Our broad portfolio of solutions also contributed to security growth as the team helped customers address heightened cybersecurity needs. Education net sales decreased by 12%, with K-12 posting a mid-single-digit decline and higher ed down mid-teens. For K-12, the team continued their success-helping schools and their efforts to sustain technology gains of the past several years. This delivered excellent growth in services and cloud, both posting double-digit gains, gains that were offset by the combined impact of a double-digit decline in netcomm and low-single-digit decline in client device sales. The high ed team's success-helping universities address business process transformation efforts contributed to double-digit growth in services and cloud. Client devices showed stability. These encouraging trends were more than offset by declines in netcomm this quarter. Other are combined UK and Canada business, declined by 14%. While the teams continued to execute well, market conditions were as expected, and sales in both the UK and Canada decreased by double digits in local currency. Once again, our diverse end markets contributed to our performance amid an uncertain and uneven environment. The second driver of performance was our broad and deep portfolio. Let's take a look at how each category performed. The market did not experience the stabilization in hardware we expected, and net sales of our hardware portfolio declined by high-single digits. This was primarily driven by double-digit year-over-year declines in netcomm as the normalization of backlog adversely impacted year-over-year growth. Client device performance improved sequentially with a low-single-digit decline. Software customer spend increased by high-single digits, but given the significant portion of the category that nets down, net sales declined. Strength was broad-based across software as we continued to help customers manage data, enhance productivity, and secure their IT environments. Growth was particularly strong across security, virtualization, and application suites. Cloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to growth's profit. Customer spend increased across all end markets, with roughly half a spend from commercial customers. Infrastructure as-a-service, productivity, and security were the top three cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase, and customer spend increased by low-single digits. Our teams continue to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement identity and access management solutions, and provide training to our customers to help manage cloud deployments and enhance endpoint and application security. Services was a standout category this period, with double-digit increases in professional and managed services. Integral to today's complex technology solutions, customers continue to lean into CDW as an extension of their own teams and leverage our services capabilities as part of their strategies. Our portfolio performance leads to the third driver of our results this quarter, relentless execution of our growth strategy. Core to our growth strategy, our objective is to expand and enhance our solutions and services capabilities. Over the past five years, investments both organic and non-organic, including 10 acquisitions, have bolstered our expertise and resources in these two key areas to support our full stack, full life cycle, full outcomes, go-to-market approach. Investments that have grown our capabilities in high-growth complex areas like cloud migration and cyber security, that have enhanced capabilities like full stack and cloud-native software development, DevOps engineering, robust consulting, and cloud-based workflow automation, expertise and resources, and investments that have expanded our services footprint across the U.S. and Canada. As you can see, each investment we made is purposeful and delivers a specific capability that furthers our strategy. A strategy designed to ensure we evolve with the market and constantly fortify our leading position as trusted advisor to our customers and vendor partner of choice. Evolving with capabilities that underpin our relevance and ensure we are there for our customers today and as new technologies come to market. New technologies like artificial intelligence. With its extremely short high cycle, our customers are increasingly seeking opportunities to use AI to achieve their objectives. And while most customers are in the discovery phase, some are already adopting AI with our help. There's a great example. An industry-leading semiconductor and software designer needed training and development for a domain-specific large language model to support a range of internal use cases. The data-intensive and highly proprietary nature of the company's designs and intellectual property made the use of a hyperscaler's LLM and cloud-based compute and storage resources less optimal. The CDW hybrid infrastructure team worked with the customer to build a custom platform that supports both training and inference workloads for generative AI. The team designed the underlying architecture, which included a best-in-class 16-node supercomputer, with a high-performance parallel file system storage solution. The successful installation and customer handoff resulted in a multi-million-dollar hardware and software engagement and service with opportunity. With both usage and use cases growing quickly, the company has engaged CDW to support further expansion of their existing infrastructure and to evaluate new solutions. Clearly, investments in our customer-centric growth strategy have elevated our relevance to customers to the highest level it's ever been. Our focused and disciplined execution of our strategy continues to make us a vital technology partner, whether enabling customer priorities that require high complex or transactional solutions. And that leads us to our 2024 outlook. The uneven market conditions we experienced throughout 2023 have persisted into 2024. Customer decisions remain deliberate and restrained with ongoing projects scrutiny, pursuit of short-term ROIs, and continued buying hesitancy, particularly around hardware. With this backdrop, we currently look for the U.S. IT market to grow by low single digits in 2024 on a customer spend basis, including the expectation of a slow start to the year, a view that incorporates the potential impact of some of our recent wildcards, including upcoming elections and geopolitical issues. For CDW, these conditions set up a year that thematically looks much like 2023, and our outlook assumes the growth of customer spend outpaces our net sales growth. Our customers face proliferating data and ever-expanding cybersecurity needs. They face expanding workloads and hardware obsolescence, and they face the potential and promise of exciting new technologies. With our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services, we are there for our customers today and tomorrow, wherever their priorities lie. We are there for our customers as their trusted advisor to help them navigate increasingly complex technologies. Whether growth comes from consumption-based or as-a-service solutions, or from hardware sales, we are well-positioned to continue our track record of profitably outpacing U.S. IT market growth by 200 to 300 basis points. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages, and out-execute the competition. Now, let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\nAl Miralles: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my preparatory remarks with detail on fourth quarter performance, briefly touch on full-year 2023 results, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2024 outlook. The team's strong execution and our financial discipline delivered very strong quarterly growth and operating margins, and growth in our fourth quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis. We achieved these results on consolidated net sales of $5 billion, which were 7.7% below 2022, on a reported and average daily sales basis. Fourth quarter net sales performance reflected both our ongoing success providing cloud and SaaS-based solutions that drove meaningful customer spend and profits, and the continued impact of uneven market conditions that we experienced throughout 2023. On a sequential average daily sales basis, fourth quarter net sales decreased 10.8%. While historically fourth quarter net sales are lower than the third quarter, the sequential climb this quarter was more significant than we expected, reflecting a lack of hardware spending recovery, a continued mix shift into solutions that net down, and generally softer economic conditions impacting our international end markets. Fourth quarter gross profit was $1.2 billion, down 2.3% versus prior year, with our gross margin increasing 130 basis point year-over-year, and partially offsetting the impact of lower net sales volume. Gross margin of 23% was driven by one factor, a higher mix into netted down revenues, which while dampening net sales growth also enhanced gross profit margin. Cloud and SaaS-based revenue streams once again outpaced overall net sales growth. For the quarter, this category represented a high 35.4% of our gross profit compared to 30.7% in the prior year fourth quarter, and was also up from the third quarter's 32.6% level. While we expect the mix of netted down revenues to be an important long-term durable trend within our business, it is important to recognize that this mix may fluctuate with customer priorities and product demand. Turning to expenses for the fourth quarter, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $635 million, down 3.5% year-over-year, prudent and diligent management of discretionary expenses and our overall fixed cost base helped to hold the line on profitability amid the challenging IT spending environment. Co-worker counts at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 15,100, up slightly from the third quarter and flat relative to year-end 2022. We continue to expand our solutions and services capabilities while concurrently driving efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Following along on slide nine, our flexible business model and financial discipline helped to deliver non-GAAP operating income of $519 million, down 0.8% versus the prior year, despite our contraction on the top line. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached 10.3%, up 70 basis points from the prior year, and up 40 basis points from last year's 9.9%. As reflected on slide 10, our non-GAAP net income was $349 million in the quarter, up 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. With fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately $136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was up 2.8% year-over-year. Shifting gears briefly and moving to slide 11 to review full-year results, we experienced a persistently challenging environment in 2023. Uncertainty for our customers caused re-evaluation and optimization of their tech spending, which combined with a marked shift in spending mix led to a full-year decline in our net sales of 10% on both the reported and average daily sales basis. Despite the top-line decline, gross profit was approximately flat, down 0.7% for the year. This gross profit stability exemplifies the impact of our strategy over the last five years with both organic and inorganic investments underpinning the team's ability to pivot to our customers where customers need us, no matter the environment. Enhanced gross margin combined with effective cost controls resulted in a full-year non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.5%, with non-GAAP operating profit dollars similarly down just 0.6% year-over-year. Moving down the P&L, our net interest expense was slightly below our full-year expectations driven by higher interest income earned on our cash balances. Our tax rate was within our expected range. As shown on slide 12, our non-GAAP net income was $1.3 billion, up 0.4%, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $9.88, up 0.9% from the prior year. Moving ahead to slide 13, at period end, net debt was $5.1 billion. Net debt declined by approximately $200 million from the third quarter, reflecting our increased cash position and modest debt repayment during the quarter. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.8 billion. Moving to slide 14, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down four days from the prior year and within our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, particularly with respect to our inventory levels. As we have mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital on any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Strong profits and effective working capital management drove a record full-year adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, as shown on slide 15, representing 106% of non-GAAP net income and well above our stated rule of thumb at 6.7% in net sales. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $83 million to shareholders through dividends and $50 million in share repurchases. For the full year, this translated $322 million in dividends and $500 million in share repurchases. A combined $822 million return to shareholders for approximately 58% of adjusted free cash flow. This was within our initial target range for the year and slightly below our updated range through the stronger than expected cash flow in the fourth quarter. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities on slide 16. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. In 2024 and beyond, we will continue to target a 25% target ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place with targeted net leverage ratio. We ended 2023 at 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of 2022, and within our targeted range of 2 to 3 times. We have rigorous processes in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and shared purchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2024, we will target returning 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. In lockstep with this, we have announced the board's authorization for a $750 million increase to our share repurchase program. Combining our prior authorization with this new additional authorization, we currently have approximately $1.1 million of availability under share repurchase program as we start 2024. And that leads to our outlook on slide 17. The uncertain market conditions we operated under 2023 have persisted into early 2024, and customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent. And while indicators suggest a compelling need to address workload and data growth, rising security threats, and eventual client device obsolescence, our current expectations for a slow start to the year for IT spending and full-year growth in the low single-digit range. With this customer spend scenario as our baseline, we additionally expect to profitably gain 200 to 300 basis points of share in 2024. As you know, when we mix in the netted down solutions, the impact is fully reflected in our gross profit, but it is muted in our net sales growth. Conversely, when hardware volume is strong as we saw on 2021 and 2022, our net sales growth is stronger as these products are counted for on a full gross accounting basis. Given the impact of shifting customer priorities on our net sales and the inherent accounting differences that result from different business mix, we believe that gross profit has become a more effective barometer for gauging our growth expectations. As such, beginning with 2024 and go forward, we will align our outlook with a view on gross profit in lieu of net sales. Based on our current view of mix and margin rates across our portfolio, our expectation for 2024 is for low to mid single-digit gross profit growth. This assumes a flat to modestly higher gross margin relative to full-year 2023. Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be up mid single-digit share of a year. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effects tax rate can be found on slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter, we anticipate gross margin comparable to 2023's level, albeit lower than 2024, and leading to low single-digit gross profit growth on a year-over-year basis. Moving down the P&L, we expect operating expenses to be higher to begin 2024 compared to Q4 as we accrue for a reset of compensation expense that was more muted at the end of 2023, along with other seasonal workforce expenses. We expect operating expense leverage as a percentage of gross profit to gradually improve as the year progresses and expenses even out. Finally, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the low-to-mid single-digit range year-over-year. As we start the New Year, we are also adjusting our approach on the outlook for adjusted free cash flow. Again, given the variability of mix of business and the corresponding impacts on net sales, we believe the relationship between adjusted free cash flow to non-GAAP net income will provide a more consistent metric go forward. For 2024, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income. It is important to note that while we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain environment, remain confident our ability to deliver profitability margins, and cash flow to our stakeholders just as we did in 2023. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one for the brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you and good morning. My first question is just regarding your comments on the weakness in infrastructure products, particularly netcomm products, after a very strong first three quarters with that backlog down, do you get a sense of how long it's going to take in terms of that digestion period from customers and when that might pick up again?\nAl Miralles: Yes, good morning, Matt. Thanks. This is Al. I would say, Matt, at first, just I think you hit it right. We would expect some headwinds on the netcomm front. I'd say underlying demand is solid with some strength in some pockets, but not significantly strong. The bigger headwind there would really be the compares when you look back in 2023 and particularly the first few quarters, the growth in netcomm was between 20% and 40%. So with those types of growth numbers from 2023, we would expect that we'd see declines at least for the next few quarters.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you. And then on the PC demand and client devices, it looked like the year-over-year decline was much better or less worse if you will, in Q4. What are your expectations in terms of client device upgrades? It doesn't sound like you're super optimistic, at least for the first half. So what's the outlook there?\nAl Miralles: Sure, I'll take that as well, Matt. I think that's right. For at least the first half, what we're calling for is similar trends, what you've seen the last few quarters, that is continued strength and netted down revenues, specifically cloud and SaaS, and we would not see strength on the hardware side, including PCs. What our outlook calls for is a modest recovery in the back half, and that includes PCs. And look, I'll just add the, while we still believe that there is impetus and catalyst for PCs to return, it becomes just basically a matter of when, not if, we think we're a few quarters off from that.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAl Miralles: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam, please go ahead.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good morning. I just want to start at a high-level question, maybe Chris or Al could answer. But as we think about CDW from an investor perspective, a lot of us have thought of this as a compounder that generally experiences double-digit earnings growth, with an algorithm of kind of mid-single-digit top line, some leverage, some capital allocation, you kind of get to this double-digit earnings growth. You just finished a year with flattish earnings growth, and then this year, your initial guidance for 2024, I think, is mid-single-digit earnings growth. So I'm just wondering if you could revisit that, and how should investors think about CDW's earnings algorithm? At this level of size and scale, should we sort of reset our expectations and think of this more as a mid-single-digit compounder at this point? Why or why not? Thanks.\nAl Miralles: Sure. Thanks, Adam. This is Al. Look, I do think that we're in this transitory period, right? We've gone through periods of extremity with the pandemic and with returns that were significant. Obviously, there's been some digestion and quite a bit of mixed shift as we've eased in the post-pandemic period. I would continue to call 2024 a transitory period, right? We are just not seeing the strength or the return to demand on the hardware side of things as customers have essentially decided to ration their spend to items that they believe will optimize their costs, create the greatest ROI, et cetera. That being said, all cycles kind of have their beginning, and we do believe that on the backside of this, there are significant catalysts that will balance things out and include a return to growth on the hardware side. So, I think what you're seeing from our outlook and what you saw in 2023 is something like a transitory period. When we look beyond that and some of the catalysts that we think are on the other side, we believe the returns will look more significant.\nChris Leahy: Yes, and Al, thanks. I would just add, if you take a big step back, Adam, what are our customers facing? They're facing proliferating data. They're facing ever-expanding cyber threats, expanding workloads, hardware obsolescence, the incredible promise of new technologies. And so the landscape that they're facing and the essential nature of technology to every single walk of life is not going away. So as we look forward to those catalysts that Al mentioned, think about digital transformation. That's a durable trend, and it's a continuous process, and many customers have really paused on their investment and evolution in 2023. That's going to come back when uncertainty abates. Network modernization continues to be top of mind, and once that digestion gets through the process, then there's only going to be a need to handle greater network traffic and data, et cetera. Security threats continue to grow, and they're more sophisticated, kind of exclamation point. Client devices are just aging, and even the pre-pandemic devices are coming on four years old, and then we've got Windows 10 sun-setting. You've got all of those things that are catalysts that we're going to see coming down the pike, and then just add AI. Still early innings, use cases not quite proven out yet, but we're seeing incredibly exciting opportunities for the services and execution of adoption around those. So I think we couldn't be more excited about the technology industry generally.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up, Chris. Obviously, net leverage is about at optimal levels. Cash flow has certainly been a bright spot for the business. Understand the share repurchase authorization today, but wanted to ask more from a strategic M&A standpoint since that's been sort of a core competency of CDW, I would say. As you think on a forward basis, obviously, there's been some moves around you from some competitors moving into some more cloud-based strategic areas. Wondered how you were evaluating or thinking about the strategic roadmap from an M&A perspective. On one hand, I think in the past, we've talked about perhaps expanding more internationally after such strong success with the Kelway acquisition years ago. On the other hand, obviously, expanding strategic capabilities would be another direction. Just -- how you're thinking about a strategic roadmap from here? Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Yes, no problem, Adam. Thanks for the question. The vectors you hit would be still consistent with how we're thinking about it, whether geographic expansion, larger acquisitions to bolster capabilities and tuck-ins, which we've been doing. And I would just reiterate, look, M&A is a strategic driver of our value prop and our growth strategy. And you've seen us do 10 acquisitions over the past five years. And those have been very valuable in terms of driving value to our customers. So as we think about where we focus our efforts, driving capabilities and solutions that are high growth and high relevance and in services capabilities, there's a plethora of areas that we could focus, including areas like security and cloud and AI. And so, I would just say, look, at the end of the day, we've said it before, we're always looking, and we've got a number of identified targets in our pipeline, but it also has to be opportunistic. The one thing I would say, Adam, is when you think about the success in evolving our business to be able to deliver the profitability that we did this year with the hardware pressure and the other dynamics happening in the marketplace, that's due to bringing on capabilities that are highly strategic, highly relevant, and then executing against them. So when I think back five years versus now, our cloud business has grown on a compound annual growth basis by 30%, and we did it again in 2023. I look at security, another area that we were very focused on, a maiden acquisition in addition to internal investments, and that business has doubled in three years. So we really are investing behind the most important capabilities, and we're seeing great results as a result.\nAl Miralles: Adam, let me just add one element you hit it on the front end. We take pride in our ability to compound, and you noted about free cash flow. In the environment we've been in, there's a bit of a kind of hunkering down, focus on margin, focus on cash flow. You'll note that we've increased our cash position. We're excited about what's on the horizon from a capital perspective when we think about the cash optionality we have in front of us, and that would certainly include M&A.\nAdam Tindle: Make sense. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant of Citigroup. Asiya, please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for taking my question. How do you guys think about market share gain in the current environment? And if you could maybe peel back a little bit on the gross profit linearity, looks like that's going to be a key metric, and I agree that's the rightful metric. Maybe if you can walk us through the confidence and what's driving the confidence in improving gross profit growth rates from the low single digits at the start of the year, and as you ramp through the year? Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Thanks for the question. I'll start on market share gain. Look, we hold ourselves accountable consistently to deliver 200 to 300 basis points above IT market rate of growth, and we have a track record of doing just that, and we are confident that in 2023 we did gain share. If you look at our net sales versus what customers spend with CDW, we've talked about that delta widening significantly, and we're over seven basis points now, so we're very confident that we've taken share, even in this very cautious and uneven market environment, and that's due to team's excellent execution and the value of our full stack full life cycle portfolio. Al, I'll turn it to you for the gross profit question.\nAl Miralles: Yes, so, Asiya, on the gross profit front, obviously like Chris said, there is a focus in this environment thinking about customer spend, and that spread between customer spend and net sales has been significant. We also feel confident about the continued trend of items such as netted down revenues, which we think will bolster gross margin. There may be a bit of an evening out on the gross margin front in the back -- the back half, as we see additional mix of hardware start to kick in, but all things considered, I think that the seasonality and the pacing of GP would not be dissimilar what you've seen in historical seasonal trends.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. And so just to recap, you guys are thinking about some perhaps modest recovery in the second half on client devices, and again, that backdrop, you guys are still kind of thinking about gross profit improving sequentially as you progress through the year?\nAl Miralles: Yes, I think that is broadly correct on the mixed front in terms of the modest recovery in the back half, and with that, our GP would accelerate through the year.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Amit, please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good morning, everyone. I have two as well. I guess, Chris, maybe you should stop, but I'd love to understand, as you engage and talk to customers, what are the top priorities from an IT spend perspective in calendar '24? And I'm sure AI is a very hot topic, but the part I'd love to understand is, are the investments for AI, the dollars for that, are they coming from some other bucket, i.e., they're cannibalistic, or are they going to be net incremental to IT budgets?\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Amit. And yeah, in terms of priorities, they're consistent with what we said in the prepared remarks. I mean, customers in the commercial space in particular are focused on cost optimization, customer employee experience, and things that revolve around that. There's still a heavy focus on digital transformation, obviously, and security as well. AI, which is where you're getting to, AI is a hyper focus. I think last call, we mentioned that you can't have a conversation with a customer without AI coming up, and it's been very exciting because we've had a data AI practice for several years, and that practice, I would say, we deepened it and we scaled it, particularly when we brought IGNW and Sirius into the CDW family. And currently, I'd say there's burgeoning demand for consultative services in particular, and I'm talking deep technical capabilities as well as industry specific capabilities. And so, we're seeing quite a bit of momentum in our practice there. What I would tell you is that a number of customers are at the front end of their experiences, and we're helping them through use cases and what the efficiencies are to be had. And then we've got customers who are actually piloting some really interesting capabilities, and we're helping them work through those. Here's what we're not seeing. We're not seeing a budget shift out of IT. What we are seeing and hearing is that budgets are coming from elsewhere in the organization, the functional areas that are going to be improved through AI innovation, like HR, like finance, like marketing, literally across the organization. Organizations are using budgets there to allocate to AI improvements because they're thinking about it merely as business transformation. So we haven't seen a shift, and frankly, we're not expecting that to happen. We're very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, though.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you for that. And I guess, Al, if I could ask you a question. Gross margins in '23 are up about 210 basis points. I think if I go from '21 to '22, they're up 0 to 400. I always get a question on like what is the right gross margin range for CDW. But as you look at this performance, maybe for calendar '23, to the extent you can parse that, how much of this do you think the gross margin expansion is secular versus cyclical? And is there a normalized range once you think about gross margins for the company?\nAl Miralles: Sure. Thanks, and good morning, Amit. Look, if I peel back 2023, three core drivers, the most significant would be the pickup and mix shift, the netted down revenues, and particularly SaaS and cloud. And that was the most significant component. Number two would be that hardware was softer, and therefore that less mix of hardware and particularly PCs benefited us from a mixed perspective. And then three, and we've noted this before, overall product margins were firm in 2023. And so that was a positive contributor to the gross margin story. So if I scroll that forward, which I think is the logical question on it, we expect that the netted down revenue trend is durable and will continue. And particularly, we would know we expect strength in the first half, and then you'll get some balancing out with hardware. Number two, on the hardware front, we are expecting a modest recovery in the back half on hardware, including PCs. So that would have the effective diluting margin somewhat. To be candid, though, we don't believe that that shift in what we're calling modest would significantly move the gross margins. And then finally, on the product margin front, but we studied this closely, and really our assessment at this point would be that product margins are holding firm. And I think that's a reflection of both a competitive environment, but not any rational environment for pricing and margin perspective. And then I've mentioned this before, but there's a trend of, I'll call it richer configurations on the product front, right, customers moving up the value chain. And we do feel like that trend is and will persist. And so really, that's the rationale overall for our outlook on gross margins being substantially similar to 2023, maybe a tick up.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, the line is yours.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Good morning. As we think about AI and understanding it's very nascent still for you guys and the rest of the industry. Is this more of a solution or a hardware or a software or consulting, you know, opportunity for AI and for a CDW? And how does that evolve over the next several years? How should we think about that?\nChris Leahy: Yes, it's a great question. I would say currently nascent, the opportunity and the burgeoning demand right now is because of the complexity and the speed and trying to figure out and test use cases. So we are seeing most of the activity for us in our advisory and consulting services. I think I use the word burgeoning. The momentum has been significant. But if you think longer term, this is a full stack play. And that's why CDW is a scaled full stack full life cycle provider with expertise, not just technically, but deep into each industry vertical is positions as well to help our customers. And as you know, when we think about CDW strategy and the growth over the years, we have been moving our capabilities to ensure that we are moving closer to the front end of the value chain. AI is a great example of that strategy and action given the consulting momentum that we've been seeing. But at the end of the day, we're talking about the need for power and consumption and data center enhancements and up and down the stack. So in terms of timing across the next several years, it's hard to say exactly when the various components of the stack will hit. But what I would say is just like any kind of revolutionary technology change, it moves fast and this will move faster. So we're seeing AI as an accelerant in our business and one that we think will play out fairly quickly over the next 24 months.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks. And maybe a follow-up, maybe to touch on a little bit here, but it did occur to you guys to announce some optimization charges within the EPS. So perhaps Al, you can perhaps touch on the genesis of what those items were?\nAl Miralles: I'm sorry, Keith, can you say that one more time?\nKeith Housum: Yes. Just when we look at your non-GAAP EPS, we see that you had some optimization charges or restructuring charges in there. Perhaps you can just highlight what those items were made up of?\nAl Miralles: Yes, sure. So largely, Keith, they would fall in the category of workforce optimization, really two components to that. We did have, as you know, some co-worker events during 2023. And that was really about aligning our fixed cost base and our co-worker count base with the level of the business and activity we were seeing. So that's one, call that more really one-time nature. The other element within that category would be real estate. As you would expect, and you're seeing more broadly, we are and continue to take a hard look at our real estate portfolio, where we are in the hybrid phase, if you will, of our workforce and making sure that we constantly re-rationalize our real estate portfolio. And so there are some charges that are coming through that front.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Samik, the line is yours.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And maybe for the first one, if I could just follow up on the AI questions and so the question Amit asked. We understand sort of your comments about being more heavy towards consulting in sort of the early days of these AI sort of discussions with their customers. But when you think of a full stack solution or Envision One in sort of when the customers deploy it, does this even take you further down the road of netted down revenue mix increasing in the overall mix of your business? Or does it really bring back or sort of pull back the netted down revenue mix in terms of balancing out the hardware and the software sales? Just curious about how you see a full stack solution playing out. And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, I'll start and then Al jump in. You know, I think it's hard to say at this point. What I would say is when we think about AI as a tool to increase productivity and results, just like we say technology is essential to every component of every organization being competitive and winning and delivering on their mission. AI is going to be central to that proposition, because artificial intelligence is going to be embedded in every component and everything that we sell from the edge to the core. And so, however that plays out in terms of how of our customers consume it, how they purchase it and how they consume it, we will be able to deliver across the full stack to them in terms of what that looks like in netted down revenue specifically. Again, hard to really have a crystal ball as to how it's going to play out in that regard. Al, any thoughts on that?\nAl Miralles: Yes, I think that's right. And Samik, look, we will see exactly how this evolves at this point. Like you said, it is a bit more consultative and maybe services oriented, which is not netted down substantially. Chris hit it earlier. This is ultimately a full stack opportunity for us. And that would certainly include hardware. So we think that will be meaningful. As I would contemplate the netted down component that would likely show up and spend associated with cloud and SaaS. So is it conceivable that we would see that come through? Certainly, it just becomes kind of a matter of when and the pacing and track, if you will, for customers and how they ultimately deploy AI.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. And I have a follow-up. I mean, just curious, given the change we've had here in the inflation backdrop, are you starting to see any changes from the customer side in relation to their discussions around pricing with you or even with the relation to the OEMs themselves? How they think about pricing or are you preparing for a different sort of pricing regime than we've been in the last sort of couple of years? Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Sure, Samik. I'll start and Chris may want to add. As I think as I mentioned, we have not seen an environment that's irrational on the pricing or the margin front. I would say, ASPs have largely held firm. So, looking forward at this point, we wouldn't see any drastic changes. We're not seeing activities from partners or customers that would suggest that we're going to see any sharp movements up or down. So our outlook is based on the presumption that we'd be largely firm here.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Erik, please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe, Chris, to start off, you know, it's been a few quarters now where you've been clear that the spending environment is challenging. And in some cases, some of that hardware spent hasn't come through in the way that you perhaps thought it was. As you talk to your customers or you look at your pipeline, what is that catalyst that will unlock the recovery in the second half of the year right now? What gives you confidence? What are you hearing or what are you seeing that that allows you to take that view as we sit here today? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, Erik, it's a great, great question. One, we actually face here at CDW. At one point, you know, we do -- we loosen the first strings. Here's what I'd say, two things. One, there's definitely pent up demand. Our customers are ready to start putting plans in action. Two, they're looking to be more confident in the expectations for the rest of the year. So while there have been some more positive indicators currently around the economy, I mean, we still have elevated inflation and elevated interest rates, and they're just merely waiting to feel more confident in where the economy is going. I hate to make it that simple, but, but frankly, it is. But we're also equally confident of the pent up demand and the desire for our customers to get moving on those projects. I'm talking about the commercial space in particular, but get moving on those projects that they have delayed and deferred for some period of time.\nErik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Chris. And then maybe Al, you know, clearly some puts and takes when it comes to free cash flow, obviously a bit of a changing business mix, depending on the environment that we're in. The new kind of net income to free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, that's a bit lower than it's just been over the last two years. Realize again, puts and takes this year, but if we -- if you could just address anything that we should think about that, that you'd call out this year specifically when it comes to either working capital changes, that would be helpful. But, but really longer term is there a rule of thumb that we should be thinking of for free cash flow conversion is 80% to 90% how we should think, you know, three, five years down the line? And that's it for me. Thanks so much.\nAl Miralles: Sure. Thanks, Erik. At this juncture, 80% to 90% is the rule of thumb that we would give you. As you recall, we start the years with a prudent view of what that would look like. And we'll see how the years play out. If you look back at the last two years, we were north of 100% on a non-GAAP net income basis. That reflected, I'd say, strong cash profits, strong and diligent management of our working capital, but also the counter cyclical components, right, as growth softened a bit, if you will. So I would say the other element that I would add for 2024, Erik, is the, we don't know exactly how the year will play out and what the pacing of business would look like. And so we try to give a little bit of space for use of working capital. Our inventory is at very low levels. And you can look at that both on a DIO and just inventory balance dollar basis. And so, look, we just want to take a prudent view out of the gates here that we may be more active users of working capital. And certainly we'll update you as the year progresses. And I would just finally just say that it is and will continue to be high priority for us of continue to drive cash flow, convert profits, and ultimately have the optionality in our capital decisions to deploy it.\nErik Woodring: Thanks so much.\nOperator: With that, I'll hand back to CEO Chris Leahy to end. Chris, please go ahead.\nChris Leahy: Well, thank you very much, Taylor. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening through your time and continued interest in CDW.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin our call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance and share some thoughts on our strategic progress and expectations for 2024. Then I will hand it over to Al, who will take you through a more detailed review of the financials as well as our capital allocation strategy and outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks as always to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Fourth quarter net sales were $5 billion, 7.7% below 2022. Strong growth and operating income margins mitigated the impact of top-line performance on profits, and we delivered gross profit of $1.15 billion, 2% lower year-over-year, non-GAAP operating income of $519 million, 1% below prior year, and non-GAAP net income per share of $2.50, up 3% year-over-year. Our results reflect consistent, strong execution by the team, our financial rigor, and our ability to deliver solutions and services across the full life cycle, full stack. Results delivered under uneven commercial and international market conditions, which continue to drive cautious customer behavior. Customer priorities remained laser-focused on operating efficiency and expense elasticity. Priorities increasingly met by as-a-service and consumption-based solutions like cloud and SaaS, as well as nascent, ratable, on-premise solutions. The team's ability to pivot to address these priorities drove excellent performance across solutions, including categories that commonly net down on a revenue basis. The impact of this success, combined with ongoing softness in traditional hardware categories, resulted in further pressure on net sales. When this happens, we experience what we saw this quarter, meaningfully dampened net sales growth with very strong gross margins. This phenomenon was not unique to the fourth quarter. Market dynamics drove hardware deprioritization and preference for solutions that net down throughout 2023, and our net sales of $21 billion were over $2 billion less than 2022. Notwithstanding our muted top lines, strong execution by the team underpinned by our full stack, full lifecycle, full outcomes, go-to-market approach delivered flat, non-GAAP operating income, a 1% increase in non-GAAP net income per share, and strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion. Outcomes driven by the strategic investments we have made over the past five years to increase the value we deliver to our customers. That is the power of our strategy when combined with our resilient business model. 2023 was a year that truly pressure tested our strategy. The fourth quarter is an exemplary example of this inaction. There were three main drivers of results, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, breadth of our product solutions and services portfolio, and relentless execution of our three-part strategy for growth. First, the balanced portfolio of our diverse customer end markets. As you know, we have five U.S. sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government, and education. Each channel is a meaningful billion-dollar-plus business on its own. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geographies and verticals. We also have our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together deliver sales of US$2.6 billion. Often, our customer end markets perform differently given macroeconomic or industry-specific headwinds or tailwinds. This quarter, all but one customer end market experienced a decline in net sales. The profit story was very different, with gross margin increasing across all customer end markets. Let's take a look at the puts and takes of how each end market performed in the quarter. Corporate net sales decreased 8%. Top-line performance continued to reflect the impact of both netting down and hardware pressure. Momentum remained for projects focused on increasing productivity, as well as projects focused on enhanced customer and co-worker experiences. The team's ability to meet customer demand for these priorities with as-a-service and ratable solutions drove strong cloud performance. Year-over-year client device declines moderated down mid-single digits compared to the double-digit declines of the first three quarters. For netcomm, while network modernization stayed a top priority, customers focused on digesting investments made over the past few years, leading to a long-expected backlog of normalization, and sales declined year-over-year. Small business net sales declined 13%. Market conditions were consistent with the first three quarters of the year, and customer behavior remained cautious. Priorities remained squarely focused on cost management and projects that need to get done. Once again, projects that were more launched than needs remained paused. Customer demand for projects with shorter-term return on investment drove excellent performance in cloud and in total security -- total software, excuse me. Security remained a top priority, and the team delivered strong performance across our broad portfolio of hardware, software, and services security offerings. Similar to corporate, small business client device declines moderated in the quarter, down-high single digits compared to the prior three quarters double-digit decline. Public sales decreased 4% year-over-year as government's mid-single-digit net sales increase was more than offset by declines across our other public-ed markets. The federal team delivered a double-digit net sales increase as they continued their success helping agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This drove excellent netcomm performance up strong double digits. The team continued its efforts to help agencies optimize their existing cloud environments as well as deliver new cloud solutions. The state and local team delivered a mid-single-digit increase. The team's success-enabling cloud-based solutions, especially with budget constrained cities, delivered a triple-digit increase in cloud performance. For the second quarter in a row, the team delivered sales growth in client devices. Healthcare net sales decreased by 5%, augmenting talent needs, modernizing data centers, driving cost savings and efficiency projects, all remained focus areas for our customers. The team drove a significant increase in cloud performance. Growth driven by their success-helping systems adopt deep cloud portfolio, which includes proprietary healthcare solutions. Our broad portfolio of solutions also contributed to security growth as the team helped customers address heightened cybersecurity needs. Education net sales decreased by 12%, with K-12 posting a mid-single-digit decline and higher ed down mid-teens. For K-12, the team continued their success-helping schools and their efforts to sustain technology gains of the past several years. This delivered excellent growth in services and cloud, both posting double-digit gains, gains that were offset by the combined impact of a double-digit decline in netcomm and low-single-digit decline in client device sales. The high ed team's success-helping universities address business process transformation efforts contributed to double-digit growth in services and cloud. Client devices showed stability. These encouraging trends were more than offset by declines in netcomm this quarter. Other are combined UK and Canada business, declined by 14%. While the teams continued to execute well, market conditions were as expected, and sales in both the UK and Canada decreased by double digits in local currency. Once again, our diverse end markets contributed to our performance amid an uncertain and uneven environment. The second driver of performance was our broad and deep portfolio. Let's take a look at how each category performed. The market did not experience the stabilization in hardware we expected, and net sales of our hardware portfolio declined by high-single digits. This was primarily driven by double-digit year-over-year declines in netcomm as the normalization of backlog adversely impacted year-over-year growth. Client device performance improved sequentially with a low-single-digit decline. Software customer spend increased by high-single digits, but given the significant portion of the category that nets down, net sales declined. Strength was broad-based across software as we continued to help customers manage data, enhance productivity, and secure their IT environments. Growth was particularly strong across security, virtualization, and application suites. Cloud remained an important driver of performance across the business and was a meaningful contributor to growth's profit. Customer spend increased across all end markets, with roughly half a spend from commercial customers. Infrastructure as-a-service, productivity, and security were the top three cloud workloads during the period. Security remains top of mind for our customers as cyber threats continue to emerge, evolve and increase, and customer spend increased by low-single digits. Our teams continue to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement identity and access management solutions, and provide training to our customers to help manage cloud deployments and enhance endpoint and application security. Services was a standout category this period, with double-digit increases in professional and managed services. Integral to today's complex technology solutions, customers continue to lean into CDW as an extension of their own teams and leverage our services capabilities as part of their strategies. Our portfolio performance leads to the third driver of our results this quarter, relentless execution of our growth strategy. Core to our growth strategy, our objective is to expand and enhance our solutions and services capabilities. Over the past five years, investments both organic and non-organic, including 10 acquisitions, have bolstered our expertise and resources in these two key areas to support our full stack, full life cycle, full outcomes, go-to-market approach. Investments that have grown our capabilities in high-growth complex areas like cloud migration and cyber security, that have enhanced capabilities like full stack and cloud-native software development, DevOps engineering, robust consulting, and cloud-based workflow automation, expertise and resources, and investments that have expanded our services footprint across the U.S. and Canada. As you can see, each investment we made is purposeful and delivers a specific capability that furthers our strategy. A strategy designed to ensure we evolve with the market and constantly fortify our leading position as trusted advisor to our customers and vendor partner of choice. Evolving with capabilities that underpin our relevance and ensure we are there for our customers today and as new technologies come to market. New technologies like artificial intelligence. With its extremely short high cycle, our customers are increasingly seeking opportunities to use AI to achieve their objectives. And while most customers are in the discovery phase, some are already adopting AI with our help. There's a great example. An industry-leading semiconductor and software designer needed training and development for a domain-specific large language model to support a range of internal use cases. The data-intensive and highly proprietary nature of the company's designs and intellectual property made the use of a hyperscaler's LLM and cloud-based compute and storage resources less optimal. The CDW hybrid infrastructure team worked with the customer to build a custom platform that supports both training and inference workloads for generative AI. The team designed the underlying architecture, which included a best-in-class 16-node supercomputer, with a high-performance parallel file system storage solution. The successful installation and customer handoff resulted in a multi-million-dollar hardware and software engagement and service with opportunity. With both usage and use cases growing quickly, the company has engaged CDW to support further expansion of their existing infrastructure and to evaluate new solutions. Clearly, investments in our customer-centric growth strategy have elevated our relevance to customers to the highest level it's ever been. Our focused and disciplined execution of our strategy continues to make us a vital technology partner, whether enabling customer priorities that require high complex or transactional solutions. And that leads us to our 2024 outlook. The uneven market conditions we experienced throughout 2023 have persisted into 2024. Customer decisions remain deliberate and restrained with ongoing projects scrutiny, pursuit of short-term ROIs, and continued buying hesitancy, particularly around hardware. With this backdrop, we currently look for the U.S. IT market to grow by low single digits in 2024 on a customer spend basis, including the expectation of a slow start to the year, a view that incorporates the potential impact of some of our recent wildcards, including upcoming elections and geopolitical issues. For CDW, these conditions set up a year that thematically looks much like 2023, and our outlook assumes the growth of customer spend outpaces our net sales growth. Our customers face proliferating data and ever-expanding cybersecurity needs. They face expanding workloads and hardware obsolescence, and they face the potential and promise of exciting new technologies. With our broad and deep portfolio of solutions and services, we are there for our customers today and tomorrow, wherever their priorities lie. We are there for our customers as their trusted advisor to help them navigate increasingly complex technologies. Whether growth comes from consumption-based or as-a-service solutions, or from hardware sales, we are well-positioned to continue our track record of profitably outpacing U.S. IT market growth by 200 to 300 basis points. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages, and out-execute the competition. Now, let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Yes, and Al, thanks. I would just add, if you take a big step back, Adam, what are our customers facing? They're facing proliferating data. They're facing ever-expanding cyber threats, expanding workloads, hardware obsolescence, the incredible promise of new technologies. And so the landscape that they're facing and the essential nature of technology to every single walk of life is not going away. So as we look forward to those catalysts that Al mentioned, think about digital transformation. That's a durable trend, and it's a continuous process, and many customers have really paused on their investment and evolution in 2023. That's going to come back when uncertainty abates. Network modernization continues to be top of mind, and once that digestion gets through the process, then there's only going to be a need to handle greater network traffic and data, et cetera. Security threats continue to grow, and they're more sophisticated, kind of exclamation point. Client devices are just aging, and even the pre-pandemic devices are coming on four years old, and then we've got Windows 10 sun-setting. You've got all of those things that are catalysts that we're going to see coming down the pike, and then just add AI. Still early innings, use cases not quite proven out yet, but we're seeing incredibly exciting opportunities for the services and execution of adoption around those. So I think we couldn't be more excited about the technology industry generally. Yes, no problem, Adam. Thanks for the question. The vectors you hit would be still consistent with how we're thinking about it, whether geographic expansion, larger acquisitions to bolster capabilities and tuck-ins, which we've been doing. And I would just reiterate, look, M&A is a strategic driver of our value prop and our growth strategy. And you've seen us do 10 acquisitions over the past five years. And those have been very valuable in terms of driving value to our customers. So as we think about where we focus our efforts, driving capabilities and solutions that are high growth and high relevance and in services capabilities, there's a plethora of areas that we could focus, including areas like security and cloud and AI. And so, I would just say, look, at the end of the day, we've said it before, we're always looking, and we've got a number of identified targets in our pipeline, but it also has to be opportunistic. The one thing I would say, Adam, is when you think about the success in evolving our business to be able to deliver the profitability that we did this year with the hardware pressure and the other dynamics happening in the marketplace, that's due to bringing on capabilities that are highly strategic, highly relevant, and then executing against them. So when I think back five years versus now, our cloud business has grown on a compound annual growth basis by 30%, and we did it again in 2023. I look at security, another area that we were very focused on, a maiden acquisition in addition to internal investments, and that business has doubled in three years. So we really are investing behind the most important capabilities, and we're seeing great results as a result. Thanks for the question. I'll start on market share gain. Look, we hold ourselves accountable consistently to deliver 200 to 300 basis points above IT market rate of growth, and we have a track record of doing just that, and we are confident that in 2023 we did gain share. If you look at our net sales versus what customers spend with CDW, we've talked about that delta widening significantly, and we're over seven basis points now, so we're very confident that we've taken share, even in this very cautious and uneven market environment, and that's due to team's excellent execution and the value of our full stack full life cycle portfolio. Al, I'll turn it to you for the gross profit question. Good morning, Amit. And yeah, in terms of priorities, they're consistent with what we said in the prepared remarks. I mean, customers in the commercial space in particular are focused on cost optimization, customer employee experience, and things that revolve around that. There's still a heavy focus on digital transformation, obviously, and security as well. AI, which is where you're getting to, AI is a hyper focus. I think last call, we mentioned that you can't have a conversation with a customer without AI coming up, and it's been very exciting because we've had a data AI practice for several years, and that practice, I would say, we deepened it and we scaled it, particularly when we brought IGNW and Sirius into the CDW family. And currently, I'd say there's burgeoning demand for consultative services in particular, and I'm talking deep technical capabilities as well as industry specific capabilities. And so, we're seeing quite a bit of momentum in our practice there. What I would tell you is that a number of customers are at the front end of their experiences, and we're helping them through use cases and what the efficiencies are to be had. And then we've got customers who are actually piloting some really interesting capabilities, and we're helping them work through those. Here's what we're not seeing. We're not seeing a budget shift out of IT. What we are seeing and hearing is that budgets are coming from elsewhere in the organization, the functional areas that are going to be improved through AI innovation, like HR, like finance, like marketing, literally across the organization. Organizations are using budgets there to allocate to AI improvements because they're thinking about it merely as business transformation. So we haven't seen a shift, and frankly, we're not expecting that to happen. We're very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, though. Yes, it's a great question. I would say currently nascent, the opportunity and the burgeoning demand right now is because of the complexity and the speed and trying to figure out and test use cases. So we are seeing most of the activity for us in our advisory and consulting services. I think I use the word burgeoning. The momentum has been significant. But if you think longer term, this is a full stack play. And that's why CDW is a scaled full stack full life cycle provider with expertise, not just technically, but deep into each industry vertical is positions as well to help our customers. And as you know, when we think about CDW strategy and the growth over the years, we have been moving our capabilities to ensure that we are moving closer to the front end of the value chain. AI is a great example of that strategy and action given the consulting momentum that we've been seeing. But at the end of the day, we're talking about the need for power and consumption and data center enhancements and up and down the stack. So in terms of timing across the next several years, it's hard to say exactly when the various components of the stack will hit. But what I would say is just like any kind of revolutionary technology change, it moves fast and this will move faster. So we're seeing AI as an accelerant in our business and one that we think will play out fairly quickly over the next 24 months. Yeah, I'll start and then Al jump in. You know, I think it's hard to say at this point. What I would say is when we think about AI as a tool to increase productivity and results, just like we say technology is essential to every component of every organization being competitive and winning and delivering on their mission. AI is going to be central to that proposition, because artificial intelligence is going to be embedded in every component and everything that we sell from the edge to the core. And so, however that plays out in terms of how of our customers consume it, how they purchase it and how they consume it, we will be able to deliver across the full stack to them in terms of what that looks like in netted down revenue specifically. Again, hard to really have a crystal ball as to how it's going to play out in that regard. Al, any thoughts on that? Yeah, Erik, it's a great, great question. One, we actually face here at CDW. At one point, you know, we do -- we loosen the first strings. Here's what I'd say, two things. One, there's definitely pent up demand. Our customers are ready to start putting plans in action. Two, they're looking to be more confident in the expectations for the rest of the year. So while there have been some more positive indicators currently around the economy, I mean, we still have elevated inflation and elevated interest rates, and they're just merely waiting to feel more confident in where the economy is going. I hate to make it that simple, but, but frankly, it is. But we're also equally confident of the pent up demand and the desire for our customers to get moving on those projects. I'm talking about the commercial space in particular, but get moving on those projects that they have delayed and deferred for some period of time. Well, thank you very much, Taylor. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening through your time and continued interest in CDW."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my preparatory remarks with detail on fourth quarter performance, briefly touch on full-year 2023 results, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2024 outlook. The team's strong execution and our financial discipline delivered very strong quarterly growth and operating margins, and growth in our fourth quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis. We achieved these results on consolidated net sales of $5 billion, which were 7.7% below 2022, on a reported and average daily sales basis. Fourth quarter net sales performance reflected both our ongoing success providing cloud and SaaS-based solutions that drove meaningful customer spend and profits, and the continued impact of uneven market conditions that we experienced throughout 2023. On a sequential average daily sales basis, fourth quarter net sales decreased 10.8%. While historically fourth quarter net sales are lower than the third quarter, the sequential climb this quarter was more significant than we expected, reflecting a lack of hardware spending recovery, a continued mix shift into solutions that net down, and generally softer economic conditions impacting our international end markets. Fourth quarter gross profit was $1.2 billion, down 2.3% versus prior year, with our gross margin increasing 130 basis point year-over-year, and partially offsetting the impact of lower net sales volume. Gross margin of 23% was driven by one factor, a higher mix into netted down revenues, which while dampening net sales growth also enhanced gross profit margin. Cloud and SaaS-based revenue streams once again outpaced overall net sales growth. For the quarter, this category represented a high 35.4% of our gross profit compared to 30.7% in the prior year fourth quarter, and was also up from the third quarter's 32.6% level. While we expect the mix of netted down revenues to be an important long-term durable trend within our business, it is important to recognize that this mix may fluctuate with customer priorities and product demand. Turning to expenses for the fourth quarter, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $635 million, down 3.5% year-over-year, prudent and diligent management of discretionary expenses and our overall fixed cost base helped to hold the line on profitability amid the challenging IT spending environment. Co-worker counts at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 15,100, up slightly from the third quarter and flat relative to year-end 2022. We continue to expand our solutions and services capabilities while concurrently driving efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Following along on slide nine, our flexible business model and financial discipline helped to deliver non-GAAP operating income of $519 million, down 0.8% versus the prior year, despite our contraction on the top line. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached 10.3%, up 70 basis points from the prior year, and up 40 basis points from last year's 9.9%. As reflected on slide 10, our non-GAAP net income was $349 million in the quarter, up 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. With fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately $136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was up 2.8% year-over-year. Shifting gears briefly and moving to slide 11 to review full-year results, we experienced a persistently challenging environment in 2023. Uncertainty for our customers caused re-evaluation and optimization of their tech spending, which combined with a marked shift in spending mix led to a full-year decline in our net sales of 10% on both the reported and average daily sales basis. Despite the top-line decline, gross profit was approximately flat, down 0.7% for the year. This gross profit stability exemplifies the impact of our strategy over the last five years with both organic and inorganic investments underpinning the team's ability to pivot to our customers where customers need us, no matter the environment. Enhanced gross margin combined with effective cost controls resulted in a full-year non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.5%, with non-GAAP operating profit dollars similarly down just 0.6% year-over-year. Moving down the P&L, our net interest expense was slightly below our full-year expectations driven by higher interest income earned on our cash balances. Our tax rate was within our expected range. As shown on slide 12, our non-GAAP net income was $1.3 billion, up 0.4%, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $9.88, up 0.9% from the prior year. Moving ahead to slide 13, at period end, net debt was $5.1 billion. Net debt declined by approximately $200 million from the third quarter, reflecting our increased cash position and modest debt repayment during the quarter. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.8 billion. Moving to slide 14, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, down four days from the prior year and within our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, particularly with respect to our inventory levels. As we have mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital on any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Strong profits and effective working capital management drove a record full-year adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion, as shown on slide 15, representing 106% of non-GAAP net income and well above our stated rule of thumb at 6.7% in net sales. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $83 million to shareholders through dividends and $50 million in share repurchases. For the full year, this translated $322 million in dividends and $500 million in share repurchases. A combined $822 million return to shareholders for approximately 58% of adjusted free cash flow. This was within our initial target range for the year and slightly below our updated range through the stronger than expected cash flow in the fourth quarter. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities on slide 16. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. In 2024 and beyond, we will continue to target a 25% target ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place with targeted net leverage ratio. We ended 2023 at 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of 2022, and within our targeted range of 2 to 3 times. We have rigorous processes in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and shared purchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2024, we will target returning 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. In lockstep with this, we have announced the board's authorization for a $750 million increase to our share repurchase program. Combining our prior authorization with this new additional authorization, we currently have approximately $1.1 million of availability under share repurchase program as we start 2024. And that leads to our outlook on slide 17. The uncertain market conditions we operated under 2023 have persisted into early 2024, and customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent. And while indicators suggest a compelling need to address workload and data growth, rising security threats, and eventual client device obsolescence, our current expectations for a slow start to the year for IT spending and full-year growth in the low single-digit range. With this customer spend scenario as our baseline, we additionally expect to profitably gain 200 to 300 basis points of share in 2024. As you know, when we mix in the netted down solutions, the impact is fully reflected in our gross profit, but it is muted in our net sales growth. Conversely, when hardware volume is strong as we saw on 2021 and 2022, our net sales growth is stronger as these products are counted for on a full gross accounting basis. Given the impact of shifting customer priorities on our net sales and the inherent accounting differences that result from different business mix, we believe that gross profit has become a more effective barometer for gauging our growth expectations. As such, beginning with 2024 and go forward, we will align our outlook with a view on gross profit in lieu of net sales. Based on our current view of mix and margin rates across our portfolio, our expectation for 2024 is for low to mid single-digit gross profit growth. This assumes a flat to modestly higher gross margin relative to full-year 2023. Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be up mid single-digit share of a year. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and the non-GAAP effects tax rate can be found on slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts for the first quarter, we anticipate gross margin comparable to 2023's level, albeit lower than 2024, and leading to low single-digit gross profit growth on a year-over-year basis. Moving down the P&L, we expect operating expenses to be higher to begin 2024 compared to Q4 as we accrue for a reset of compensation expense that was more muted at the end of 2023, along with other seasonal workforce expenses. We expect operating expense leverage as a percentage of gross profit to gradually improve as the year progresses and expenses even out. Finally, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the low-to-mid single-digit range year-over-year. As we start the New Year, we are also adjusting our approach on the outlook for adjusted free cash flow. Again, given the variability of mix of business and the corresponding impacts on net sales, we believe the relationship between adjusted free cash flow to non-GAAP net income will provide a more consistent metric go forward. For 2024, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income. It is important to note that while we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain environment, remain confident our ability to deliver profitability margins, and cash flow to our stakeholders just as we did in 2023. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one for the brief follow-up. Thank you. Yes, good morning, Matt. Thanks. This is Al. I would say, Matt, at first, just I think you hit it right. We would expect some headwinds on the netcomm front. I'd say underlying demand is solid with some strength in some pockets, but not significantly strong. The bigger headwind there would really be the compares when you look back in 2023 and particularly the first few quarters, the growth in netcomm was between 20% and 40%. So with those types of growth numbers from 2023, we would expect that we'd see declines at least for the next few quarters. Sure, I'll take that as well, Matt. I think that's right. For at least the first half, what we're calling for is similar trends, what you've seen the last few quarters, that is continued strength and netted down revenues, specifically cloud and SaaS, and we would not see strength on the hardware side, including PCs. What our outlook calls for is a modest recovery in the back half, and that includes PCs. And look, I'll just add the, while we still believe that there is impetus and catalyst for PCs to return, it becomes just basically a matter of when, not if, we think we're a few quarters off from that. You're welcome. Sure. Thanks, Adam. This is Al. Look, I do think that we're in this transitory period, right? We've gone through periods of extremity with the pandemic and with returns that were significant. Obviously, there's been some digestion and quite a bit of mixed shift as we've eased in the post-pandemic period. I would continue to call 2024 a transitory period, right? We are just not seeing the strength or the return to demand on the hardware side of things as customers have essentially decided to ration their spend to items that they believe will optimize their costs, create the greatest ROI, et cetera. That being said, all cycles kind of have their beginning, and we do believe that on the backside of this, there are significant catalysts that will balance things out and include a return to growth on the hardware side. So, I think what you're seeing from our outlook and what you saw in 2023 is something like a transitory period. When we look beyond that and some of the catalysts that we think are on the other side, we believe the returns will look more significant. Adam, let me just add one element you hit it on the front end. We take pride in our ability to compound, and you noted about free cash flow. In the environment we've been in, there's a bit of a kind of hunkering down, focus on margin, focus on cash flow. You'll note that we've increased our cash position. We're excited about what's on the horizon from a capital perspective when we think about the cash optionality we have in front of us, and that would certainly include M&A. Yes, so, Asiya, on the gross profit front, obviously like Chris said, there is a focus in this environment thinking about customer spend, and that spread between customer spend and net sales has been significant. We also feel confident about the continued trend of items such as netted down revenues, which we think will bolster gross margin. There may be a bit of an evening out on the gross margin front in the back -- the back half, as we see additional mix of hardware start to kick in, but all things considered, I think that the seasonality and the pacing of GP would not be dissimilar what you've seen in historical seasonal trends. Yes, I think that is broadly correct on the mixed front in terms of the modest recovery in the back half, and with that, our GP would accelerate through the year. Sure. Thanks, and good morning, Amit. Look, if I peel back 2023, three core drivers, the most significant would be the pickup and mix shift, the netted down revenues, and particularly SaaS and cloud. And that was the most significant component. Number two would be that hardware was softer, and therefore that less mix of hardware and particularly PCs benefited us from a mixed perspective. And then three, and we've noted this before, overall product margins were firm in 2023. And so that was a positive contributor to the gross margin story. So if I scroll that forward, which I think is the logical question on it, we expect that the netted down revenue trend is durable and will continue. And particularly, we would know we expect strength in the first half, and then you'll get some balancing out with hardware. Number two, on the hardware front, we are expecting a modest recovery in the back half on hardware, including PCs. So that would have the effective diluting margin somewhat. To be candid, though, we don't believe that that shift in what we're calling modest would significantly move the gross margins. And then finally, on the product margin front, but we studied this closely, and really our assessment at this point would be that product margins are holding firm. And I think that's a reflection of both a competitive environment, but not any rational environment for pricing and margin perspective. And then I've mentioned this before, but there's a trend of, I'll call it richer configurations on the product front, right, customers moving up the value chain. And we do feel like that trend is and will persist. And so really, that's the rationale overall for our outlook on gross margins being substantially similar to 2023, maybe a tick up. I'm sorry, Keith, can you say that one more time? Yes, sure. So largely, Keith, they would fall in the category of workforce optimization, really two components to that. We did have, as you know, some co-worker events during 2023. And that was really about aligning our fixed cost base and our co-worker count base with the level of the business and activity we were seeing. So that's one, call that more really one-time nature. The other element within that category would be real estate. As you would expect, and you're seeing more broadly, we are and continue to take a hard look at our real estate portfolio, where we are in the hybrid phase, if you will, of our workforce and making sure that we constantly re-rationalize our real estate portfolio. And so there are some charges that are coming through that front. You're welcome. Yes, I think that's right. And Samik, look, we will see exactly how this evolves at this point. Like you said, it is a bit more consultative and maybe services oriented, which is not netted down substantially. Chris hit it earlier. This is ultimately a full stack opportunity for us. And that would certainly include hardware. So we think that will be meaningful. As I would contemplate the netted down component that would likely show up and spend associated with cloud and SaaS. So is it conceivable that we would see that come through? Certainly, it just becomes kind of a matter of when and the pacing and track, if you will, for customers and how they ultimately deploy AI. Sure, Samik. I'll start and Chris may want to add. As I think as I mentioned, we have not seen an environment that's irrational on the pricing or the margin front. I would say, ASPs have largely held firm. So, looking forward at this point, we wouldn't see any drastic changes. We're not seeing activities from partners or customers that would suggest that we're going to see any sharp movements up or down. So our outlook is based on the presumption that we'd be largely firm here. Sure. Thanks, Erik. At this juncture, 80% to 90% is the rule of thumb that we would give you. As you recall, we start the years with a prudent view of what that would look like. And we'll see how the years play out. If you look back at the last two years, we were north of 100% on a non-GAAP net income basis. That reflected, I'd say, strong cash profits, strong and diligent management of our working capital, but also the counter cyclical components, right, as growth softened a bit, if you will. So I would say the other element that I would add for 2024, Erik, is the, we don't know exactly how the year will play out and what the pacing of business would look like. And so we try to give a little bit of space for use of working capital. Our inventory is at very low levels. And you can look at that both on a DIO and just inventory balance dollar basis. And so, look, we just want to take a prudent view out of the gates here that we may be more active users of working capital. And certainly we'll update you as the year progresses. And I would just finally just say that it is and will continue to be high priority for us of continue to drive cash flow, convert profits, and ultimately have the optionality in our capital decisions to deploy it."

I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. The team continued to execute extremely well under persistently challenged conditions. Commercial markets remained cautious and conditions in international markets worsened, public markets held firm. For the quarter, the team delivered net sales of $5.6 billion, 8% lower than last year, record non-GAAP operating income of $556 million, up 1% year-over-year. And record non-GAAP net income per share of $2.72, up 4% year-over-year. Record profitability that underscores the power of our strategy when underpinned by our resilient business model and financial rigor. Profitability driven by relentless execution and profitability that is a clear demonstration of the value we deliver to our customers. Customers maintain their laser focus on mission-critical priorities and optimizing costs and once again, our deep and broad portfolio enabled the team to pivot to solutions that address our customers' priorities. Solutions that provide operating efficiency and expense elasticity like burstable performance in modern, hybrid and multi-cloud environments or solutions that are usage-based like SaaS and private cloud. Solutions, we are well-positioned to deliver. In today's environment, where customers are closely scrutinizing their IT spend. Our value as a trusted adviser is greater than ever before, an adviser who helps customers cut through complexity and evaluate options. An adviser, who designs, deploys, integrates and many times manages the solution. Capabilities made possible by the investments we have made in our three-part strategy for growth. Investments that enable us to serve customers across the full stack and full life cycle. Investments that have made us a vital technology partner. As we have executed our strategy, the amount that customers spend with us has consistently grown faster than net sales, a dynamic that reflects both the success of our strategic investments and increasing customer preferences for cloud and SaaS-based solutions. Recall that these offerings drive significant customer spend that are netted down in our sales and thus dampen our top line growth while enhancing our gross margin. Let's take a deeper look at quarterly results. There were three main drivers of performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our breadth of solutions and services portfolio and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Each of our five build sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education is a meaningful business on its own with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act counter-cyclically, given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each, you see the benefit of our balanced portfolio again this quarter with public performance partially mitigating declines in commercial. Commercial market conditions continue to weigh on customer confidence and drive cautious purchasing behavior. Instead of the modest improvement in hardware we expected, we continue to experience pressure, particularly in client devices. Corporate net sales decreased 12%. Momentum continued around projects focused on increasing productivity, as well as projects focused on enhanced customer and go over experiences. With a shorter-term ROI lens, customers favored solutions enabled by cloud, which contributed to double-digit increases in corporate customer spend on cloud. AI and security were also major customer focus areas with CIOs increasingly being asked two questions, what are you doing with AI and how are you projecting our data? While AI remains in early stages of commercialization and development, and not yet translating into meaningful customer spend, our full portfolio of security offerings contributed to double-digit increase in security spend. Ongoing network modernization also led to excellent net comp performance, once again up double digits. Corporate top line performance continued to reflect meaningful year-over-year client device declines with ongoing postponement of upgrades and utilization of existing products. Small business net sales declined 22%. Market conditions were consistent with the second quarter, and customers continue to see clarity around the economy and more conducive conditions for hiring and new business formation. Focus remains on cost management and the prioritization of product \u2013 projects that need to get done. Projects that were more want rather than needs remain hot. Consistent with the second quarter, solutions increased up low single digits, while transactions declined by double-digits. Focus on shorter-term ROI for mission-critical priorities drove double-digit spend in cloud and software. Client devices continue to drive small business top line performance as refresh remained on the back burner and declines were on par with the second quarter. Public sales increased 1% year-over-year. Healthcare and education each posted a 2% increase, while performance was flat in government compared to last year's exceptional near 40% growth. Government performed relatively in line with historical seasonality, with Federal's mid-single-digit growth, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in state and local. The federal team continued its success helping agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This delivered excellent server performance up strong double-digits. The team also continued its work with agencies to optimize existing cloud investments and deliver new cloud solutions, which require rigorous proof of concept. The state and local team delivered solid sequential growth well above the historical averages, up 4%, but net sales declined mid-single digits compared to last year's double-digit growth. Solid Solutions growth was more than offset by a decline in transactions. Cloud-enabled solution adoption with strong, delivering double-digit increases in customer spend. Healthcare net sales increased 2% augmenting talent needs, modernizing data centers and driving cost savings and efficiency projects remain focused areas for customers. With complex industry challenges and tight operating budgets, healthcare systems continue to turn to cloud solutions. Armed with our full portfolio, which includes proprietary cloud-based health care solutions, the team drove a significant increase in cloud spend. Our broad portfolio of solutions also contributed to a double-digit increase in security spend growth as they help customers address heightened cybersecurity needs. Needs driven by the disproportionate percentage of all ransomware attacks that target healthcare organization. For education, net sales increased low single-digits, the first positive growth quarter for education in over eight quarters. K-12 low single digits increase more than offset a low single-digit decline in higher ed. Higher ed high single-digits increase in Solutions was offset by a double-digit decline in transactions, a decline largely driven by ongoing declines in client devices. Institutions continue to invest to improve security, campus connectivity and student experiences. The teams continue to focus on delivering these impactful solutions led to double-digit growth across netcomm, services and software. It also delivered low-teens growth in cloud spend. For K-12, the team continued their success helping schools and their efforts to achieve digital equity and improve learning outcomes, which delivered excellent growth in services and netcomm. Solutions grew meaningfully, while transactions declined low-teens, reflecting ongoing moderation of client device spend, security remained a key focus area with double-digit growth in customer spend. Other, our combined UK and Canada business came in below our expectations, down mid-teens. While the teams continue to execute well, the deterioration in market conditions in the UK and Canada were deeper than we anticipated, both the UK and Canada decreased by double-digits in local currency. Our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and enable consistent performance amid an uncertain and uneven macro environment. The second strategic advantage and driver of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio, which enables us to pivot to address our customers' evolving needs. Similar to the second quarter, solutions sales increased mid-single digits, while transactions remained under pressure, down high teens. Hardware declined by double digits. Similar to the second quarter, performance continued to reflect depressed client device demand, particularly in the commercial space. Overall, client performance was roughly in line with the second quarter's double-digit decline. Net comp increased double digits with stable demand. Backlog continues to feather out and is now approximating historic levels. Cloud spend increased nearly 20% with increases across every end market, roughly half of our total third quarter cloud spend came from commercial customers and half from public. Security spend increased by double digits with a significant portion being delivered via software and the cloud. Cloud and security success contributed to a mid-teens increase in software, increases across virtualization and network management and security were partially offset by declines in categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels. Solid managed and professional services growth was more than offset by the impact of continued drag from lower services attached to transactional and solutions hardware and overall services net sales declined. As you can see, performance varies significantly across the portfolio. That is the power of our deep and broad portfolio. It enables us to meet our customers where they are and it is power driven by the investments we have made in our growth strategy. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our growth strategy. A strategy guided by three pillars; first, capture share and acquire new customers; second, enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions area; and third, expand services capabilities. Over the past five years, we have broadened and deepened our capabilities. Our comprehensive life cycle management capabilities now deliver design, deployment, integration and management, capabilities that have deepened our relevance to customers and fortified our role as a trusted adviser to our customers. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers across physical, digital or cloud based environment in the US and internationally and capabilities that drive favorable outcomes for our customers. In today's uncertain macro environment, with customers increasingly reluctant to make big upfront capital investment, our ability to deliver the cost savings outcome of our ICARE framework is a major competitive advantage. Armed with our consultative approach to problem solving, the teams both identify and implement consumption-based solutions with lower upfront costs, solutions that enable customers to move ahead with mission-critical projects, solutions that deliver value to our customers and deepen customer relationships. Many of these solutions are enabled by our Cloud Readiness Assessment, enablement and migration services, which are second to none in the industry. A great example of this in action is a solution we provided to an Illinois school district that had a legacy converged storage environment reaching end of life. The customer had three priorities; first, student teacher and administrator experience. Second, agility to meet end of school year deadline; and third, deliver costs that they manage within the constraints of their fixed budget. After a comprehensive evaluation of the wide range of on-premise and hybrid cloud solutions we can provide, the team determined that a consumption-based approach would provide the best outcome for the customer ultimately developing a private cloud hyperconverged solution. A solution that supports deployment and management of modern applications and provides the ability to seamlessly scale for future growth, one that delivered needed flexibility and cost predictability and deepens our relationship as a trusted adviser, another great win-win. Investments in our customer-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the US IT market, and that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. You will recall last quarter, we shared our expectations for the US IT market to post a decline of high single digits in 2023. This assumes three things. First, greater clarity in the market would lead to a modest improvement in the commercial IT hardware market in the back half of the year. Second, a moderate deterioration in the UK and Canada; and third, a return to normal seasonality in the public space. We did see a return to normal seasonality in public and while commercial spend has been stable there was a greater shift to solutions that net down in lieu of IT hardware spend. We also saw a deeper-than-expected international market deterioration. Current conditions and order today customer interactions lead us to expect these trends to continue. Our estimate of US IT market growth in 2023 remains at a high single-digit decline, and we continue to expect to profitably outperform the US IT market by 200 to 300 basis points when adjusted for this year's meaningful shift in customer spend to our complex solutions that net down. We are cognizant of the significant wild cards to our customers in the market space in this environment, a list that has grown more complex and now includes intensifying geopolitical instability and potential for federal government shutdown. We will continue to keep a watchful eye on these and other potential factors as we always do, and we will provide an update on business conditions on our next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Now, let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al?\nAl Miralles: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail on the third quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. This quarter, our continued execution and financial discipline delivered three notable records: record gross margin, record operating margin and record earnings per share on a diluted basis. We achieved these records on consolidated net sales of $5.6 billion, which were 9.4% in 2022 on a reported basis and down 8% on an average daily sales basis. Third quarter net sales performance reflected both the impact of uneven market conditions and our continued success providing cloud and SaaS-based solutions that drive meaningful customer spend. On a sequential basis, third quarter net sales increased 1.6% on an average daily sales basis, slightly lower than our outlook, reflecting a higher-than-anticipated mix in the cloud and SaaS-based solutions that are netted down, in our top line results as well as economic conditions that adversely impacted our international business. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus prior year as a record gross margin, which increased 200 basis points year-over-year, offset the impact of lower net sales. Our gross margin of 21.8% was driven by two factors. First, the impact of higher mix in the complex solutions, which have higher product margins; second, a higher mix into netted down revenues, which while dampening net sales growth also enhanced gross profit margin. These cloud and SaaS-based revenue streams once again outpaced net sales growth. For this quarter, this category represented a record 32.6% and our gross profit compared 31% in a prior year third quarter. While we expect this mix shift to continue to be an important durable trend within our business, eventually, we anticipate a greater mix back in transactional products, which will balance out both the top line growth and corresponding gross margin impacts we've experienced in 2023. For the third quarter, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $671 million, down 1.9% year-over-year. Coworker count in the third quarter was approximately 15,000, up slightly from the second quarter. We continue to prioritize investments in our three-part strategy that are important catalysts for the achievement of our growth, profitability and margin goals. As our customers optimize and rationalize their own IT investments, our disciplined approach to discretionary expenses helped drive non-GAAP operating income of $556 million, up $7 million or 1.3% versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached a record 9.9%, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Moving down the P&L. Our interest expense tax rate remained in line with our expectations. As you can see on slide 8, our non-GAAP net income was $369 million in the quarter, up 3.5% on a year-over-year basis with third quarter weighted average diluted shares of 136 million. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was also an all time record at $2.72, up 4.4% year-on-year. Moving to slide 9 at period end, net debt was $5.3 billion or 2.4 times net leverage. During the quarter, net debt declined reflect our continued strong cash flow performance and modest debt repayment during the quarter, consistent with our targeted net leverage range of two to three times. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to slide 10. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 15 days, down three days from the prior year and below our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our continued diligent management of working capital, particularly with respect to our inventory levels, and we expect to remain at the lower end of this targeted range this year. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital in any given quarter. And we continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Strong profits and effective working capital management drove our strong year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion, as shown on slide 11, well-above our rule of thumb as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation priorities, including returning approximately $79 million to shareholders through dividends and $54 million in share repurchases. This brings us to our capital allocation priorities on slide 12. Our execution remained consistent with the objectives we communicated at the start of the year. First, as always, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. This morning, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually. This is our 10th consecutive year increasing the dividend, we've grown the dividend at a compound annual rate of approximately 31% from the initial level. Going forward, we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the quarter at 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of last year and within our targeted range of two times to three times. We continue to convert profits into cash flow and have rigorous processes in place to proactively manage liquidity, while maintaining our flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocations of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we now anticipate returning 60% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases, up from our prior range of 50% to 75%. All in all, strong results given ongoing economic uncertainty and uneven market conditions. We continue to run our playbook and remain laser-focused on margins, cash flow and predictable profitability. And that leads us to our outlook on slide 13. The uncertain marketing conditions we've operated under throughout the year are persisting and continue to lead to customer caution and prudence. Given this, we expect that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. With this scenario as our baseline, we expect to deliver a 200 to 300 basis point growth premium to the market albeit not evident on a net sales basis as the outsized share of netted down revenue makes the impact of our premium. Keep in mind that, our premium is most significant when hardware demand is strong, like in 2021 and 2022. We're currently maintain a meaningful premium to the IT market on a customer spend basis. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low to mid-9% range, up from our prior expectation of approximately 9%. This reflects our expectations of continued growth stronger profit margins along with expense efficiency as we manage through this uncertain economic environment. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an increase from our prior expectation of flat based on our strong third quarter profitability and relatively unchanged profitability expectations for the fourth quarter. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on slide 14. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter. For average daily sales, we now expect a largely seasonal mid-single-digit sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. This equates to a low- to mid-single-digit net sales decline on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter in terms of average daily sales. This is lower than we previously expected and reflective of both the current business conditions and top line mix components previously referenced. With this, we also anticipate gross profit and non-GAAP operating margins to be strong, similar to third quarter levels driven by both mix and rate elements. And we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year. For full year 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately 6% of net sales, above our prior year expectation of 5% and well above our rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5%, reflecting our strong cash generation in the first nine months of the year. While we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain market, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability, margin and cash flow to our stakeholders while continuing to invest behind our strategy. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thank you and thanks for taking my question. I'll just have two quick ones, and I'll ask both together, if that's okay. Chris, I think a broad investor concern here has been that most of the resilience we've seen in total spending from customers has been held by the public sector. And beyond that, when you look at the broader customers beyond the public sector, there hasn't been as much momentum. And in fact, momentum in spending is probably deteriorating on the commercial side. Can you dive into what you're seeing from a pipeline perspective going just beyond the public sector? And is there sustainability of demand from the commercial accounts. And for my second one, I mean, obviously, we're getting close to the end of the year here and maybe any insights you have into how you're thinking about next year spending. We haven't seen two consecutive years of significant declines in a while in enterprise spending. So any thoughts if we are at least looking at a year where you should be expecting higher spending from a lower level base, or are we looking for another year of declines from customers? Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Okay. Good morning, Mr. Samik. Let me get to the first question first on the commercial side. Look, I'll just say again that the environment this year, all year, frankly, has been cautious. It's been uneven -- has been challenging. All that said, I would say one thing that has held true is investments in technology continue to be a priority for all of our customers. What that's looked like in terms of their spending has been pretty consistent throughout the year as well. Commercial customers have remained focused on cost optimization throughout the year on operating efficiency, on experience, both employee and customer experience. And they have been more focused on consumption based and ratable solutions like cloud, much more hesitant to make significant upfront capital investments and very much focused on managing their costs throughout the year, given the fact that we continue to not have the clarity, I'd say, in the business environment that would give them the confidence to invest more heavily. Now remember, what we're seeing from where our customers are investing and how they're investing across cloud, security in some of these areas that I call mission-critical has been very strong. Clouds up double digits, securities up double digits, software is up significantly. And this is the customer reflecting the need for technology to drive their missions forward. In terms of the real impact to commercial, I would look at hardware and in particular clients. We saw some budgets loosening up a little bit in the second quarter, and we anticipated that, that would lead to a modest recovery, I'd say, in the back half of the year in hardware, in particular, in the client device. That's not proved to be true. Our customers in -- across corporate and small business are not seeing the clarity of the business climate and therefore not willing to increase their spend in that area. But net-net, what I would say about commercial is still investing behind technology in a different bucket, a bucket that is more cloud-based right now, more ratable, more prudent and measured around the immediate spend, but still very much seeing technology as critical to their mission, as I said. As we think about next year, look, we'll give you our views as we get through the year. One thing I'd say again about client devices is we're not seeing the pickup or signs of a pickup that we were hoping to see in the last half of the year. So when that happens, we'll see. But once there's clarity in the market, we might get to see that, but we have not seen those signs just yet. And that's where I'd leave it. I think we've got to get through the last couple of months. Here's what I just close with. The good news, which is the investment behind our strategy as physicians CDW to be able to offer our customers the broad portfolio, and we are seeing when they need help with their technology no matter where it sits across the full stack or the life cycle. Our sales and technical teams are there. And the good news is I'm really pleased with what I'll say is the engagement, the activity, the discussion and the depth with which we're ingraining our relationships with those customers. So feeling very good about when we kind of come out of the curve, we'll accelerate out with our customers. You've seen that in the past, and I wouldn't expect it to be any different at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Erik, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Chris, maybe can we just start out. Can you just give us a bit more detail on linearity in the quarter? And specifically how the trends progressed from July through September and into October and how that has influenced your updated expectations for the full year? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes, sure, Erik. Here's -- I'd just say, it was pretty stable throughout the whole quarter. You'll remember, in Q2, we talked about an uptick as we went through the quarter, and that gave us some level of confidence that there might be some more clarity in the business climate. In Q3, we just kind of saw the same level of activity across the three months.\nErik Woodring: Okay. Super. Thank you very much for that, Chris. And then, Al, I just wanted to dig into your gross margin comments a bit. We've heard for several quarters now about a mix shift to these more complex solutions that are obviously higher margin, when we eventually see a mix shift towards more transactional sales, as you've kind of cautioned us as we look forward. Do you expect that this will drive a mix away from these complex solutions? Or can kind of both of these trends coexist together because I think it does have an important influence on what -- how we think about gross margins in the future. So if you could just kind of help us understand if this is a zero-sum game or if you can see strong transactional alongside strength in complex solutions and what that would do for gross margins, that would be helpful. Thank you\nAl Miralles: Yeah. Thanks, and good morning, Erik. I think they definitely can coexist. I think what we've seen in the environment Erik, it's essentially, I'll say, commercial customers kind of fixing on their spend and choosing to weight that towards more of these netted down revenue streams, if you will and holding back on some of these other spend items in IT hardware and particularly in clients. But our expectation and our expectation was that with less uncertainty in the economic environment, we would see an incremental pickup on the hardware side, in particular clients. And so the expectation would be that the durable trend of our netted down revenues would persist and likely outpace net sales, but we also would see pickup in some other categories. So I do believe that, that would co-exist, we're not seeing in the current environment in a more cautious environment, but that's what hopefully the future will hold.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vogt of UBS. David, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. So two, if I may. So can you maybe just touch on the demand signals that you're seeing out there, a little bit more robustly in terms of maybe what you're hearing from customers versus the backlog signals that you're hearing? How much of the weakness is macro related, do you think, versus some continued normalization of backlog? I know you mentioned net comp sounds like it's back at normal historical levels with public as well. But I just want a little bit more color there. And then when you think about calendar 2024, and maybe go back to Sam's point, it certainly sounds like some of your related companies in your ecosystem are talking a little bit more robustly about demand, particularly in, let's say, PC clients. I'm just trying to get a sense for maybe what the disconnect is from a timing perspective, maybe a Windows 11 refresh perspective. Just any more color there would be incredibly helpful. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Yeah, sure. Good morning David, it's Al. I'll start. Overall, I'll just break it down a bit by segment. So look, as Chris suggested in Q2 what we were seeing from customers might have suggested that with a bit more clarity in the economic environment that things would pick up. And again, we noted that we would have anticipated that would be more IT hardware and PC. That has not played out, and we have seen this really sentiment-driven environment has driven buying behavior. So on the commercial side, corporate and small business, we would say stable but not showing a pickup. With respect to our public business, first, they've executed exceptionally well, but I would say pretty much in line with expected seasonality. And then maybe lastly, I would just note in the international markets, we anticipated that you would see some moderation on the demand side in Q3 and our expectations for Q4 I would say that's worse than expected. And we would call it as maybe a few quarters behind what we've seen in the demand market in the US. So there are a couple of the puts and takes in terms of the demand environment, what we saw in Q3 as well as Q4. And then, David, just to your point on backlog, as Chris suggested in her prepared remarks, our backlog is nearing normalization. Maybe the lagging piece would be more networking, but we're getting close to what we'd call normalization. So no significant impact as we sit here now.\nChris Leahy: On the PC side, the question you asked about a potential \u201cdiscipline\u201d and I'd say a couple of things. I mentioned earlier that we have not seen picking up in activity around client devices. And as we know, that's the last place that our customers start to spend again once they're feeling better about the business market. But what I would say is, we are certainly closer to the end of a downside than we are to the beginning. So that's quite clear. The other point I would make is that consumer tends to react earlier to market changes than the commercial business. So when you see a bit of a lag in terms of what we are suggesting versus what you might see from OEMs, et cetera, Part of that is who is doing the buying. The second is the timing of the market in terms of the kind of flush of inventory into the channel from the OEMs and distributors and then us to the end market. So that will account for a quarter or two of differences.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI. Amit, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good morning, everyone. I have two as well. You suppose to -- Chris, there's been some degree of chaos at the federal level from a budget perspective. It sounds like September quarter went relatively fine for you folks. But there's a Spotify day extension that I believe, expires in a couple of weeks. How are you thinking about federal spending in the December quarter and just the with from this extended shutdown potentially?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Amit, look, I guess I'd say it this way, we've been here so many times before. The team knows how to manage through both the uncertainty. And if we do have a shutdown, have to manage through that, we're past the year-end, which is good. I would say that, projects that are in-flight already will stay in flight. There might be some projects that are in flight that might be on hold. I'd say that's really we're looking at 2024. But the good news is we have a team that has executed in and out of these -- these environments, I guess, sadly, in some regards, but in these environments many, many times, and I have great confidence they'll do a terrific job this time as well.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then if I could just maybe follow-up. If I think about the operating margin performance of the company in calendar based on the midpoint of your guys in December, it's going to be up like, I don't know, 80, 90 basis points year-over-year on the operating margin side. And there's obviously a bunch of levers over here. Some of it is cyclical client devices not being well some of it is secular. But how do you think about what's the durability of these operating margins as you go forward? And if you reflect on the tailwinds in calendar 2023, how would you say is cyclical that perhaps is not sustained into the out years? Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Sure, Amit. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things I would note. I think if I kind of parse the pickup we've had in our operating margins, a few things. Number one is we benefited from -- obviously, really strong gross profit margins up 200 basis points year-over-year. And that is a function of a few things, but I'd say most notably a mix of business. And so a lot of that gross profit margin pickup is dropping down into our operating margins. The other piece, Amit, would be really just our efforts to align our expenses with what we're seeing in the business and demand vectors and that is our efforts Q1, Q2 along those lines certainly helped. We have kind of a targeted range, and I've talked about this before of high 54s into the 55 of expenses relative to GP, and that's kind of our sweet spot in this environment. That's where we're operating. Now, I'll just say that is notwithstanding, we continue to invest behind our strategy, but at the same time, we have significant efforts to drive productivity, efficiency, kind of, managing our expenses commensurate with where we stand in. So they are the major components that are driving our operating margins. So Amit, I would just maybe just say that in terms of durability, you can expect we're going to continue on the efficiency front while we invest the impacts or influence of gross margin. Certainly, the netted down growth is going to continue to help that in that regard. But as we mix more into transactional products and PC start to come back, you could have some dilution effect there. So we certainly have moved quickly on the operating margin. Some of that ultimately could see giving back, but you're going to see different geography in our income statement as it plays out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thanks and good morning. I'm hoping, Chris, that you can elaborate on the comments about the weakness in the international markets. You're not the first one calling out that specifically in Europe. So is that something that you saw throughout the quarter? And Al, you did mention that you expect that softness to continue over the next couple of quarters. So anything more you can add would be great.\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Good morning Matt. On the international front, we did start to see a downtick in Q2, which we mentioned on our last call. And I would just say, it continues with a steepness we hadn't anticipated in the third quarter. And that is across the business, very, very similar to what we've seen in the US throughout the year. And our expectation is, as Al mentioned, is we're probably a couple of quarters behind on the international front. That's both the UK and Canada in terms of performance and demand and the certainty in the market there. So that's what we're seeing.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. Thank you. And just regarding PCs, there's been buzz recently about AI enabled PCs down the line and potentially being another catalyst for upgrade cycle, are you curing that at all from customers and suppliers? And is that something that folks will get excited about at some point?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Matt, it's a great question. AI is on everybody's mind. And I think the short answer to your question is, yes, we do expect customers to get excited about AI enabled client devices. And if we just take a step back, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're at the front end of commercialization and development, but obviously, it's going very quickly. And the way we think about it is we're building what I would call our end-to-end full stack capabilities. AI is going to be integrated into all technology products across the full stack. It's going to need the infrastructure optimized to support AI. It's going to need services to be able to move from arrival to adoption. And so we are very much aligned with all of our partners, in fact, building practices with our partners around AI enabled technology. And so yes, we think customers will be excited. And again, CDW is well-positioned to help them make across the full stack and in particular, client devices. It's just there's more choice in complexity in the market. And thinking years back, Matt, where customers had to think about the technology choice, the brand choice, then we had consumption, then we have CapEx versus OpEx models. Now we've got intelligence across all of the full stack, it's getting more complicated. That said, there's a very high expectation within all of our customers that their CTOs and CIOs and their line of business leaders are thinking about how artificial intelligence can help drive their efficiency and their experiences for their customers. So look, we see it as an accelerant I think from a timing perspective, it will move fairly quickly, but we are still at the very front end stages.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Wang from Barclays. George, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Wang: Well, hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. Firstly, can you just maybe talk about share gains, especially by geo you guys talked about kind of weaker international UK, Canada. Just curious if the fit industry weakness or maybe some share shifts? Maybe you can kind of double collect on the share gains, both in the US and also in the overseas markets?\nChris Leahy: Yeah, I think the question was on share gains. Hi, George, good morning. Look, here's what I'd say. We hold ourselves accountable over the long term to outperforming the market by 200 to 300 basis points. And we feel very confident that we're continuing to do that. When I think about other periods when we had weaker hardware environment 2016 comes to mind. And in that environment, we had hardware declines, but we noted that our netted down solutions, which in those -- back in 2016 would have been software and software assurance and things like that. We're growing at a faster base, fast forward to now. And when we look at the customer spend, what customers are investing through CDW, we're seeing a delta of more than 5%. So it's a fairly big delta, and we feel very confident that we continue to take share across our markets, and we'll do so in 2023 and over the long run.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. Just a quick one, if I can, just as a follow-up. Just in terms of any tuck-in kind of bolt-on deals, given just netted down kind of margin accretion and the kind of bad guidance. Just curious, any thoughts and color you can share just on so they continue to sort of roll up kind of tuck-in deals seeing any segments do you want to cut off?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. I would say on the M&A side, I think about that as a vehicle for investing behind our strategy. And you've seen us invest both organically and through acquisitions very successfully. And again, kudos to the team for on companies that we've joined with on both sides for both moving quickly and creating more value for our customers as a result of those investments. And those have been primarily, as you know, along capabilities there are advanced solutions related, cloud, security, digital things that you are now seeing really strength in the market and strength in our business. So we'll continue to look at M&A opportunistically. And if it's the right fit, we certainly would consider moving forward is always on the docket. We're never out of the market. But I'll have Al chat a little bit about cash position.\nAl Miralles: Yeah, George, I would just add. Obviously, M& A is always front and center for us. And as we think about our capital priorities, we're going to balance strategically where are the opportunities that are going to add value to us as well as the tactic where our valuations and where can we kind of best deploy our money. So stay tuned on that. You can see that kind of we do have a -- a cash position in place, and it is a volatile and variable environment. So we certainly value optionality with respect to our capital in this environment. George, to your comment about where can we expect we're going to look across and we'll continue to look across the ecosystem of opportunities. Our last acquisition was Enquizit that was in the cloud space, mostly focused in federal. So you can imagine some of those revenue streams would have a higher concentration than netted down. But I wouldn't per se that's part of our strategy. It's going to be more about the capabilities. So more to come on that front.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu, your line is now open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two of them, one for Al, one for Chris. Al, is there a way to quantify the impact of netted down items on year-on-year sales growth in 2023? And is there anything unique about this year, or as we look into 2024-2025, should we expect a similar level of year-on-year impact or even higher? Because I mean, it looks like it makes sense for you guys to mix shift more into these items. So just your thoughts on that\nAl Miralles: Sure, Ruplu. So a few things. Number one, we've said before and we continue to say we would expect, as we look forward, that netted down revenues would outpace our overall net sales, if you will. So I'd say, give you that one data point. I will note that the mix into netted down this year has been more extreme and a couple of metrics that I'll just note; number one, netted down for the quarter of $400 million was 7% of our net sales, but 32.6% of our GP and you can go back sequentially and look at what that looked like. But it's notable both sequentially and I'd say, versus prior year. If you try to put those dollars on a more even basis with net sales that grows up, you'd get a sense for the impact. And I think, and Chris alluded to this, it would suggest that our decline in net sales is pretty considerably less than if you looked at it on this customer spend basis. So there are a couple of things you could look at from a math perspective that would show the pretty notable growth and outsized impact even down has had this year.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details there. Chris, let me ask you this. On the prepared remarks, you talked about device refreshes remaining on the back burner. As you look out over the next couple of quarters and 2024, given fundamentals like the age of PCs in the market, I mean, do you expect to see any device refreshes either in the client side or in the data center side. And I think you've said that typically, when that happens, CDW's outperformance to the US IT spend is at the higher end of the 200 to 300 basis points range. So I guess what I'm getting at is even though the macro is weaker today, should we expect that when the macro improves and you get this added benefit of device refreshes that your outperformance can actually be at the higher end of the normal range. So can you give us your thoughts on that, please?\nChris Leahy: Yeah, Ruplu good morning, and I would say you've got it right, our track record of outperformance we were seeing refreshing hardware is strong. And part of that is our ability to gain share. And part of that is the fact that those are recognized on the top line net basis. And so we tend to outperform our premium as a result of those two things. In terms of looking forward, I just repeat a little of what I said, Ruplu, which is we do feel that clients, the downswing is kind of we're at the back end of that cycle, if you will, as opposed to the start of that cycle. That said, as Al mentioned, it's really a sentiment-driven market right now driving demand. And until our larger commercial customers had a level of confidence in the business climate, we think that client device and even data center refresh will be kind of the last point where they start to invest more dollars. Now, you're right, we're -- we've got a refresh cycle. We've got 40-year-old Tove devices, et cetera. We've got Win 11 coming. So there are a lot of things in the market that will certainly be a tailwind for client devices. AI, as we mentioned, embedded in client devices, those are all going to be positive. And I would also add that our teams are definitely having conversations with customers about refresh in terms of planning, we're just not seeing that convert. And again, we'll be ready when they're ready to convert, but it's just not to converting yet.\nOperator: And our last question today comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Adam, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAdam Tindle: All right. Save the best for last. Al, I wanted to maybe start by reflecting on 2023, the silver lining this year, I think it's been cost management. You've been protecting earnings all year despite very volatile revenue. And I think you mentioned that OpEx to GP is your metric, which makes sense, but it's now optimal. So the question would be, as we look forward, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like the outlook for 2024, based on what you're seeing is a little bit more muted. I see you're not really investing in headcount, it's up modestly sequentially. Inventory days are very low, so you're not carrying up for revenue growth. You've got mix shifting on -- as a headwind for GP dollars. So the question would be how to think about protecting earnings in a more muted environment moving forward? Would it be fair for us to anticipate more negative operating leverage moving forward? Why or why not? Thanks.\nAl Miralles: Sure. Thanks, Adam. Great question. A couple of things I would call out. First, like I gave you the range how we think about expenses. Just understand kind of underneath the engine there, there are puts and takes in terms of the -- where are we driving productivity, where we're driving efficiency. Not only to kind of keep within that range, but also to make sure that we can appropriately fund investment opportunities. I think what you can expect is those efficiency efforts will continue, but we will continue to invest. And you noted that our headcount was slightly up, but it was up. If you look at the gross effect of the those -- that headcount would look at more significant, if you will, from a gross basis. So look, I think it's a balancing act. I think, Adam, as we start to see the demand cycle start to turn in some of the areas we've talked about we would certainly accelerate and continue to ramp-up on the investment side. But I would call the efficiency efforts somewhat evergreen. And so therefore, when you add that up, we're still going to try to remain within a range. I would not be able to tell you definitively every quarter, if we show operating leverage, there could be some quarters where we say there was a great opportunity. And therefore, we have less operating leverage or de-lever but it's going to be a big quarter-to-quarter with kind of that strategic balance that I mentioned on top of that.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Maybe a quick follow-up on gross margin. I understand that net revenue is benefiting or mix. But we can exclude that, give it a 100% gross margin and strip it out and look at just traditional hardware gross margin. And at current levels, I'd love for you to maybe unpack some of the items that might be more cyclical versus structural and help us to gauge the outcomes, because that analysis can get some pretty scary outcomes of returning back to historical levels. I think you can get over $1 of EPS coming out from reverting that back to the mean. So if you could unpack the ex-net revenue gross margin and what's cyclical versus structural, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Yeah, absolutely, Adam. So I've talked about in the past, obviously, mix matters, and we've had a pretty extreme mix movement particularly this year on these netted down revenues in lieu of hardware, PCs, et cetera. Certainly, we would expect that to balance out over time. And so that is a variable that would dilute gross margins. The other piece, Adam, would be that in general, product margins have held very firm. And if you look back over the last two years, they've actually moved up quite a bit. So there's been resiliency there. I would also note that though in that, there is this component of more upmarket premium spend on higher level, higher value product that is persisting, and we're seeing that continue to hold up. And there may be an element there that what you bought in the way of premium product. Now you're in it and you're going to continue to invest in that same way. And then the last component, Adam, I would note, and we know this, that over time, you could see commoditization. We've not seen that, but it's conceivable that some of that could come back over time. So we are at pretty significant levels in terms of gross margin when you add those components up. Certainly, components that I referenced that are durable and in some areas, some components that could be somewhat transitory and we could see at a bit over time.\nOperator: And with no further questions, I'd like to hand the call back to the CDW team for closing remarks.\nChris Leahy: Thank you very much. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our nearly 15,000 coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you, everyone for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. The team continued to execute extremely well under persistently challenged conditions. Commercial markets remained cautious and conditions in international markets worsened, public markets held firm. For the quarter, the team delivered net sales of $5.6 billion, 8% lower than last year, record non-GAAP operating income of $556 million, up 1% year-over-year. And record non-GAAP net income per share of $2.72, up 4% year-over-year. Record profitability that underscores the power of our strategy when underpinned by our resilient business model and financial rigor. Profitability driven by relentless execution and profitability that is a clear demonstration of the value we deliver to our customers. Customers maintain their laser focus on mission-critical priorities and optimizing costs and once again, our deep and broad portfolio enabled the team to pivot to solutions that address our customers' priorities. Solutions that provide operating efficiency and expense elasticity like burstable performance in modern, hybrid and multi-cloud environments or solutions that are usage-based like SaaS and private cloud. Solutions, we are well-positioned to deliver. In today's environment, where customers are closely scrutinizing their IT spend. Our value as a trusted adviser is greater than ever before, an adviser who helps customers cut through complexity and evaluate options. An adviser, who designs, deploys, integrates and many times manages the solution. Capabilities made possible by the investments we have made in our three-part strategy for growth. Investments that enable us to serve customers across the full stack and full life cycle. Investments that have made us a vital technology partner. As we have executed our strategy, the amount that customers spend with us has consistently grown faster than net sales, a dynamic that reflects both the success of our strategic investments and increasing customer preferences for cloud and SaaS-based solutions. Recall that these offerings drive significant customer spend that are netted down in our sales and thus dampen our top line growth while enhancing our gross margin. Let's take a deeper look at quarterly results. There were three main drivers of performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets, our breadth of solutions and services portfolio and ongoing execution of our three-part strategy. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Each of our five build sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education is a meaningful business on its own with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act counter-cyclically, given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each, you see the benefit of our balanced portfolio again this quarter with public performance partially mitigating declines in commercial. Commercial market conditions continue to weigh on customer confidence and drive cautious purchasing behavior. Instead of the modest improvement in hardware we expected, we continue to experience pressure, particularly in client devices. Corporate net sales decreased 12%. Momentum continued around projects focused on increasing productivity, as well as projects focused on enhanced customer and go over experiences. With a shorter-term ROI lens, customers favored solutions enabled by cloud, which contributed to double-digit increases in corporate customer spend on cloud. AI and security were also major customer focus areas with CIOs increasingly being asked two questions, what are you doing with AI and how are you projecting our data? While AI remains in early stages of commercialization and development, and not yet translating into meaningful customer spend, our full portfolio of security offerings contributed to double-digit increase in security spend. Ongoing network modernization also led to excellent net comp performance, once again up double digits. Corporate top line performance continued to reflect meaningful year-over-year client device declines with ongoing postponement of upgrades and utilization of existing products. Small business net sales declined 22%. Market conditions were consistent with the second quarter, and customers continue to see clarity around the economy and more conducive conditions for hiring and new business formation. Focus remains on cost management and the prioritization of product \u2013 projects that need to get done. Projects that were more want rather than needs remain hot. Consistent with the second quarter, solutions increased up low single digits, while transactions declined by double-digits. Focus on shorter-term ROI for mission-critical priorities drove double-digit spend in cloud and software. Client devices continue to drive small business top line performance as refresh remained on the back burner and declines were on par with the second quarter. Public sales increased 1% year-over-year. Healthcare and education each posted a 2% increase, while performance was flat in government compared to last year's exceptional near 40% growth. Government performed relatively in line with historical seasonality, with Federal's mid-single-digit growth, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in state and local. The federal team continued its success helping agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This delivered excellent server performance up strong double-digits. The team also continued its work with agencies to optimize existing cloud investments and deliver new cloud solutions, which require rigorous proof of concept. The state and local team delivered solid sequential growth well above the historical averages, up 4%, but net sales declined mid-single digits compared to last year's double-digit growth. Solid Solutions growth was more than offset by a decline in transactions. Cloud-enabled solution adoption with strong, delivering double-digit increases in customer spend. Healthcare net sales increased 2% augmenting talent needs, modernizing data centers and driving cost savings and efficiency projects remain focused areas for customers. With complex industry challenges and tight operating budgets, healthcare systems continue to turn to cloud solutions. Armed with our full portfolio, which includes proprietary cloud-based health care solutions, the team drove a significant increase in cloud spend. Our broad portfolio of solutions also contributed to a double-digit increase in security spend growth as they help customers address heightened cybersecurity needs. Needs driven by the disproportionate percentage of all ransomware attacks that target healthcare organization. For education, net sales increased low single-digits, the first positive growth quarter for education in over eight quarters. K-12 low single digits increase more than offset a low single-digit decline in higher ed. Higher ed high single-digits increase in Solutions was offset by a double-digit decline in transactions, a decline largely driven by ongoing declines in client devices. Institutions continue to invest to improve security, campus connectivity and student experiences. The teams continue to focus on delivering these impactful solutions led to double-digit growth across netcomm, services and software. It also delivered low-teens growth in cloud spend. For K-12, the team continued their success helping schools and their efforts to achieve digital equity and improve learning outcomes, which delivered excellent growth in services and netcomm. Solutions grew meaningfully, while transactions declined low-teens, reflecting ongoing moderation of client device spend, security remained a key focus area with double-digit growth in customer spend. Other, our combined UK and Canada business came in below our expectations, down mid-teens. While the teams continue to execute well, the deterioration in market conditions in the UK and Canada were deeper than we anticipated, both the UK and Canada decreased by double-digits in local currency. Our diverse end markets are both a key strategic advantage and enable consistent performance amid an uncertain and uneven macro environment. The second strategic advantage and driver of our performance was our broad and deep portfolio, which enables us to pivot to address our customers' evolving needs. Similar to the second quarter, solutions sales increased mid-single digits, while transactions remained under pressure, down high teens. Hardware declined by double digits. Similar to the second quarter, performance continued to reflect depressed client device demand, particularly in the commercial space. Overall, client performance was roughly in line with the second quarter's double-digit decline. Net comp increased double digits with stable demand. Backlog continues to feather out and is now approximating historic levels. Cloud spend increased nearly 20% with increases across every end market, roughly half of our total third quarter cloud spend came from commercial customers and half from public. Security spend increased by double digits with a significant portion being delivered via software and the cloud. Cloud and security success contributed to a mid-teens increase in software, increases across virtualization and network management and security were partially offset by declines in categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels. Solid managed and professional services growth was more than offset by the impact of continued drag from lower services attached to transactional and solutions hardware and overall services net sales declined. As you can see, performance varies significantly across the portfolio. That is the power of our deep and broad portfolio. It enables us to meet our customers where they are and it is power driven by the investments we have made in our growth strategy. And that leads to the third driver of our performance this quarter, relentless execution of our growth strategy. A strategy guided by three pillars; first, capture share and acquire new customers; second, enhance capabilities in high-growth solutions area; and third, expand services capabilities. Over the past five years, we have broadened and deepened our capabilities. Our comprehensive life cycle management capabilities now deliver design, deployment, integration and management, capabilities that have deepened our relevance to customers and fortified our role as a trusted adviser to our customers. Capabilities that enable us to best serve customers across physical, digital or cloud based environment in the US and internationally and capabilities that drive favorable outcomes for our customers. In today's uncertain macro environment, with customers increasingly reluctant to make big upfront capital investment, our ability to deliver the cost savings outcome of our ICARE framework is a major competitive advantage. Armed with our consultative approach to problem solving, the teams both identify and implement consumption-based solutions with lower upfront costs, solutions that enable customers to move ahead with mission-critical projects, solutions that deliver value to our customers and deepen customer relationships. Many of these solutions are enabled by our Cloud Readiness Assessment, enablement and migration services, which are second to none in the industry. A great example of this in action is a solution we provided to an Illinois school district that had a legacy converged storage environment reaching end of life. The customer had three priorities; first, student teacher and administrator experience. Second, agility to meet end of school year deadline; and third, deliver costs that they manage within the constraints of their fixed budget. After a comprehensive evaluation of the wide range of on-premise and hybrid cloud solutions we can provide, the team determined that a consumption-based approach would provide the best outcome for the customer ultimately developing a private cloud hyperconverged solution. A solution that supports deployment and management of modern applications and provides the ability to seamlessly scale for future growth, one that delivered needed flexibility and cost predictability and deepens our relationship as a trusted adviser, another great win-win. Investments in our customer-centric growth strategy are foundational to our ability to consistently and profitably outgrow the US IT market, and that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. You will recall last quarter, we shared our expectations for the US IT market to post a decline of high single digits in 2023. This assumes three things. First, greater clarity in the market would lead to a modest improvement in the commercial IT hardware market in the back half of the year. Second, a moderate deterioration in the UK and Canada; and third, a return to normal seasonality in the public space. We did see a return to normal seasonality in public and while commercial spend has been stable there was a greater shift to solutions that net down in lieu of IT hardware spend. We also saw a deeper-than-expected international market deterioration. Current conditions and order today customer interactions lead us to expect these trends to continue. Our estimate of US IT market growth in 2023 remains at a high single-digit decline, and we continue to expect to profitably outperform the US IT market by 200 to 300 basis points when adjusted for this year's meaningful shift in customer spend to our complex solutions that net down. We are cognizant of the significant wild cards to our customers in the market space in this environment, a list that has grown more complex and now includes intensifying geopolitical instability and potential for federal government shutdown. We will continue to keep a watchful eye on these and other potential factors as we always do, and we will provide an update on business conditions on our next call. In the meantime, we will continue to do what we do best leverage our competitive advantages and out-execute the competition. Now, let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Al? Okay. Good morning, Mr. Samik. Let me get to the first question first on the commercial side. Look, I'll just say again that the environment this year, all year, frankly, has been cautious. It's been uneven -- has been challenging. All that said, I would say one thing that has held true is investments in technology continue to be a priority for all of our customers. What that's looked like in terms of their spending has been pretty consistent throughout the year as well. Commercial customers have remained focused on cost optimization throughout the year on operating efficiency, on experience, both employee and customer experience. And they have been more focused on consumption based and ratable solutions like cloud, much more hesitant to make significant upfront capital investments and very much focused on managing their costs throughout the year, given the fact that we continue to not have the clarity, I'd say, in the business environment that would give them the confidence to invest more heavily. Now remember, what we're seeing from where our customers are investing and how they're investing across cloud, security in some of these areas that I call mission-critical has been very strong. Clouds up double digits, securities up double digits, software is up significantly. And this is the customer reflecting the need for technology to drive their missions forward. In terms of the real impact to commercial, I would look at hardware and in particular clients. We saw some budgets loosening up a little bit in the second quarter, and we anticipated that, that would lead to a modest recovery, I'd say, in the back half of the year in hardware, in particular, in the client device. That's not proved to be true. Our customers in -- across corporate and small business are not seeing the clarity of the business climate and therefore not willing to increase their spend in that area. But net-net, what I would say about commercial is still investing behind technology in a different bucket, a bucket that is more cloud-based right now, more ratable, more prudent and measured around the immediate spend, but still very much seeing technology as critical to their mission, as I said. As we think about next year, look, we'll give you our views as we get through the year. One thing I'd say again about client devices is we're not seeing the pickup or signs of a pickup that we were hoping to see in the last half of the year. So when that happens, we'll see. But once there's clarity in the market, we might get to see that, but we have not seen those signs just yet. And that's where I'd leave it. I think we've got to get through the last couple of months. Here's what I just close with. The good news, which is the investment behind our strategy as physicians CDW to be able to offer our customers the broad portfolio, and we are seeing when they need help with their technology no matter where it sits across the full stack or the life cycle. Our sales and technical teams are there. And the good news is I'm really pleased with what I'll say is the engagement, the activity, the discussion and the depth with which we're ingraining our relationships with those customers. So feeling very good about when we kind of come out of the curve, we'll accelerate out with our customers. You've seen that in the past, and I wouldn't expect it to be any different at this time. Yes, sure, Erik. Here's -- I'd just say, it was pretty stable throughout the whole quarter. You'll remember, in Q2, we talked about an uptick as we went through the quarter, and that gave us some level of confidence that there might be some more clarity in the business climate. In Q3, we just kind of saw the same level of activity across the three months. On the PC side, the question you asked about a potential \u201cdiscipline\u201d and I'd say a couple of things. I mentioned earlier that we have not seen picking up in activity around client devices. And as we know, that's the last place that our customers start to spend again once they're feeling better about the business market. But what I would say is, we are certainly closer to the end of a downside than we are to the beginning. So that's quite clear. The other point I would make is that consumer tends to react earlier to market changes than the commercial business. So when you see a bit of a lag in terms of what we are suggesting versus what you might see from OEMs, et cetera, Part of that is who is doing the buying. The second is the timing of the market in terms of the kind of flush of inventory into the channel from the OEMs and distributors and then us to the end market. So that will account for a quarter or two of differences. Yeah. Amit, look, I guess I'd say it this way, we've been here so many times before. The team knows how to manage through both the uncertainty. And if we do have a shutdown, have to manage through that, we're past the year-end, which is good. I would say that, projects that are in-flight already will stay in flight. There might be some projects that are in flight that might be on hold. I'd say that's really we're looking at 2024. But the good news is we have a team that has executed in and out of these -- these environments, I guess, sadly, in some regards, but in these environments many, many times, and I have great confidence they'll do a terrific job this time as well. Yeah. Good morning Matt. On the international front, we did start to see a downtick in Q2, which we mentioned on our last call. And I would just say, it continues with a steepness we hadn't anticipated in the third quarter. And that is across the business, very, very similar to what we've seen in the US throughout the year. And our expectation is, as Al mentioned, is we're probably a couple of quarters behind on the international front. That's both the UK and Canada in terms of performance and demand and the certainty in the market there. So that's what we're seeing. Yeah. Matt, it's a great question. AI is on everybody's mind. And I think the short answer to your question is, yes, we do expect customers to get excited about AI enabled client devices. And if we just take a step back, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're at the front end of commercialization and development, but obviously, it's going very quickly. And the way we think about it is we're building what I would call our end-to-end full stack capabilities. AI is going to be integrated into all technology products across the full stack. It's going to need the infrastructure optimized to support AI. It's going to need services to be able to move from arrival to adoption. And so we are very much aligned with all of our partners, in fact, building practices with our partners around AI enabled technology. And so yes, we think customers will be excited. And again, CDW is well-positioned to help them make across the full stack and in particular, client devices. It's just there's more choice in complexity in the market. And thinking years back, Matt, where customers had to think about the technology choice, the brand choice, then we had consumption, then we have CapEx versus OpEx models. Now we've got intelligence across all of the full stack, it's getting more complicated. That said, there's a very high expectation within all of our customers that their CTOs and CIOs and their line of business leaders are thinking about how artificial intelligence can help drive their efficiency and their experiences for their customers. So look, we see it as an accelerant I think from a timing perspective, it will move fairly quickly, but we are still at the very front end stages. Yeah, I think the question was on share gains. Hi, George, good morning. Look, here's what I'd say. We hold ourselves accountable over the long term to outperforming the market by 200 to 300 basis points. And we feel very confident that we're continuing to do that. When I think about other periods when we had weaker hardware environment 2016 comes to mind. And in that environment, we had hardware declines, but we noted that our netted down solutions, which in those -- back in 2016 would have been software and software assurance and things like that. We're growing at a faster base, fast forward to now. And when we look at the customer spend, what customers are investing through CDW, we're seeing a delta of more than 5%. So it's a fairly big delta, and we feel very confident that we continue to take share across our markets, and we'll do so in 2023 and over the long run. Yeah. I would say on the M&A side, I think about that as a vehicle for investing behind our strategy. And you've seen us invest both organically and through acquisitions very successfully. And again, kudos to the team for on companies that we've joined with on both sides for both moving quickly and creating more value for our customers as a result of those investments. And those have been primarily, as you know, along capabilities there are advanced solutions related, cloud, security, digital things that you are now seeing really strength in the market and strength in our business. So we'll continue to look at M&A opportunistically. And if it's the right fit, we certainly would consider moving forward is always on the docket. We're never out of the market. But I'll have Al chat a little bit about cash position. Yeah, Ruplu good morning, and I would say you've got it right, our track record of outperformance we were seeing refreshing hardware is strong. And part of that is our ability to gain share. And part of that is the fact that those are recognized on the top line net basis. And so we tend to outperform our premium as a result of those two things. In terms of looking forward, I just repeat a little of what I said, Ruplu, which is we do feel that clients, the downswing is kind of we're at the back end of that cycle, if you will, as opposed to the start of that cycle. That said, as Al mentioned, it's really a sentiment-driven market right now driving demand. And until our larger commercial customers had a level of confidence in the business climate, we think that client device and even data center refresh will be kind of the last point where they start to invest more dollars. Now, you're right, we're -- we've got a refresh cycle. We've got 40-year-old Tove devices, et cetera. We've got Win 11 coming. So there are a lot of things in the market that will certainly be a tailwind for client devices. AI, as we mentioned, embedded in client devices, those are all going to be positive. And I would also add that our teams are definitely having conversations with customers about refresh in terms of planning, we're just not seeing that convert. And again, we'll be ready when they're ready to convert, but it's just not to converting yet. Thank you very much. And let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our nearly 15,000 coworkers around the globe. Their ongoing commitment to serving our customers is what makes us successful. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail on the third quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. This quarter, our continued execution and financial discipline delivered three notable records: record gross margin, record operating margin and record earnings per share on a diluted basis. We achieved these records on consolidated net sales of $5.6 billion, which were 9.4% in 2022 on a reported basis and down 8% on an average daily sales basis. Third quarter net sales performance reflected both the impact of uneven market conditions and our continued success providing cloud and SaaS-based solutions that drive meaningful customer spend. On a sequential basis, third quarter net sales increased 1.6% on an average daily sales basis, slightly lower than our outlook, reflecting a higher-than-anticipated mix in the cloud and SaaS-based solutions that are netted down, in our top line results as well as economic conditions that adversely impacted our international business. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus prior year as a record gross margin, which increased 200 basis points year-over-year, offset the impact of lower net sales. Our gross margin of 21.8% was driven by two factors. First, the impact of higher mix in the complex solutions, which have higher product margins; second, a higher mix into netted down revenues, which while dampening net sales growth also enhanced gross profit margin. These cloud and SaaS-based revenue streams once again outpaced net sales growth. For this quarter, this category represented a record 32.6% and our gross profit compared 31% in a prior year third quarter. While we expect this mix shift to continue to be an important durable trend within our business, eventually, we anticipate a greater mix back in transactional products, which will balance out both the top line growth and corresponding gross margin impacts we've experienced in 2023. For the third quarter, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $671 million, down 1.9% year-over-year. Coworker count in the third quarter was approximately 15,000, up slightly from the second quarter. We continue to prioritize investments in our three-part strategy that are important catalysts for the achievement of our growth, profitability and margin goals. As our customers optimize and rationalize their own IT investments, our disciplined approach to discretionary expenses helped drive non-GAAP operating income of $556 million, up $7 million or 1.3% versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached a record 9.9%, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Moving down the P&L. Our interest expense tax rate remained in line with our expectations. As you can see on slide 8, our non-GAAP net income was $369 million in the quarter, up 3.5% on a year-over-year basis with third quarter weighted average diluted shares of 136 million. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was also an all time record at $2.72, up 4.4% year-on-year. Moving to slide 9 at period end, net debt was $5.3 billion or 2.4 times net leverage. During the quarter, net debt declined reflect our continued strong cash flow performance and modest debt repayment during the quarter, consistent with our targeted net leverage range of two to three times. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.4 billion. Moving to slide 10. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 15 days, down three days from the prior year and below our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our continued diligent management of working capital, particularly with respect to our inventory levels, and we expect to remain at the lower end of this targeted range this year. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital in any given quarter. And we continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Strong profits and effective working capital management drove our strong year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion, as shown on slide 11, well-above our rule of thumb as a percentage of sales. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation priorities, including returning approximately $79 million to shareholders through dividends and $54 million in share repurchases. This brings us to our capital allocation priorities on slide 12. Our execution remained consistent with the objectives we communicated at the start of the year. First, as always, increased the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. This morning, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually. This is our 10th consecutive year increasing the dividend, we've grown the dividend at a compound annual rate of approximately 31% from the initial level. Going forward, we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the quarter at 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of last year and within our targeted range of two times to three times. We continue to convert profits into cash flow and have rigorous processes in place to proactively manage liquidity, while maintaining our flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocations of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we now anticipate returning 60% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases, up from our prior range of 50% to 75%. All in all, strong results given ongoing economic uncertainty and uneven market conditions. We continue to run our playbook and remain laser-focused on margins, cash flow and predictable profitability. And that leads us to our outlook on slide 13. The uncertain marketing conditions we've operated under throughout the year are persisting and continue to lead to customer caution and prudence. Given this, we expect that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. With this scenario as our baseline, we expect to deliver a 200 to 300 basis point growth premium to the market albeit not evident on a net sales basis as the outsized share of netted down revenue makes the impact of our premium. Keep in mind that, our premium is most significant when hardware demand is strong, like in 2021 and 2022. We're currently maintain a meaningful premium to the IT market on a customer spend basis. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to be in the low to mid-9% range, up from our prior expectation of approximately 9%. This reflects our expectations of continued growth stronger profit margins along with expense efficiency as we manage through this uncertain economic environment. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an increase from our prior expectation of flat based on our strong third quarter profitability and relatively unchanged profitability expectations for the fourth quarter. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on slide 14. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter. For average daily sales, we now expect a largely seasonal mid-single-digit sequential decline from Q3 to Q4. This equates to a low- to mid-single-digit net sales decline on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter in terms of average daily sales. This is lower than we previously expected and reflective of both the current business conditions and top line mix components previously referenced. With this, we also anticipate gross profit and non-GAAP operating margins to be strong, similar to third quarter levels driven by both mix and rate elements. And we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow low single digits year-over-year. For full year 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately 6% of net sales, above our prior year expectation of 5% and well above our rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5%, reflecting our strong cash generation in the first nine months of the year. While we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain market, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability, margin and cash flow to our stakeholders while continuing to invest behind our strategy. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, and good morning, Erik. I think they definitely can coexist. I think what we've seen in the environment Erik, it's essentially, I'll say, commercial customers kind of fixing on their spend and choosing to weight that towards more of these netted down revenue streams, if you will and holding back on some of these other spend items in IT hardware and particularly in clients. But our expectation and our expectation was that with less uncertainty in the economic environment, we would see an incremental pickup on the hardware side, in particular clients. And so the expectation would be that the durable trend of our netted down revenues would persist and likely outpace net sales, but we also would see pickup in some other categories. So I do believe that, that would co-exist, we're not seeing in the current environment in a more cautious environment, but that's what hopefully the future will hold. Yeah, sure. Good morning David, it's Al. I'll start. Overall, I'll just break it down a bit by segment. So look, as Chris suggested in Q2 what we were seeing from customers might have suggested that with a bit more clarity in the economic environment that things would pick up. And again, we noted that we would have anticipated that would be more IT hardware and PC. That has not played out, and we have seen this really sentiment-driven environment has driven buying behavior. So on the commercial side, corporate and small business, we would say stable but not showing a pickup. With respect to our public business, first, they've executed exceptionally well, but I would say pretty much in line with expected seasonality. And then maybe lastly, I would just note in the international markets, we anticipated that you would see some moderation on the demand side in Q3 and our expectations for Q4 I would say that's worse than expected. And we would call it as maybe a few quarters behind what we've seen in the demand market in the US. So there are a couple of the puts and takes in terms of the demand environment, what we saw in Q3 as well as Q4. And then, David, just to your point on backlog, as Chris suggested in her prepared remarks, our backlog is nearing normalization. Maybe the lagging piece would be more networking, but we're getting close to what we'd call normalization. So no significant impact as we sit here now. Sure, Amit. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things I would note. I think if I kind of parse the pickup we've had in our operating margins, a few things. Number one is we benefited from -- obviously, really strong gross profit margins up 200 basis points year-over-year. And that is a function of a few things, but I'd say most notably a mix of business. And so a lot of that gross profit margin pickup is dropping down into our operating margins. The other piece, Amit, would be really just our efforts to align our expenses with what we're seeing in the business and demand vectors and that is our efforts Q1, Q2 along those lines certainly helped. We have kind of a targeted range, and I've talked about this before of high 54s into the 55 of expenses relative to GP, and that's kind of our sweet spot in this environment. That's where we're operating. Now, I'll just say that is notwithstanding, we continue to invest behind our strategy, but at the same time, we have significant efforts to drive productivity, efficiency, kind of, managing our expenses commensurate with where we stand in. So they are the major components that are driving our operating margins. So Amit, I would just maybe just say that in terms of durability, you can expect we're going to continue on the efficiency front while we invest the impacts or influence of gross margin. Certainly, the netted down growth is going to continue to help that in that regard. But as we mix more into transactional products and PC start to come back, you could have some dilution effect there. So we certainly have moved quickly on the operating margin. Some of that ultimately could see giving back, but you're going to see different geography in our income statement as it plays out. Yeah, George, I would just add. Obviously, M& A is always front and center for us. And as we think about our capital priorities, we're going to balance strategically where are the opportunities that are going to add value to us as well as the tactic where our valuations and where can we kind of best deploy our money. So stay tuned on that. You can see that kind of we do have a -- a cash position in place, and it is a volatile and variable environment. So we certainly value optionality with respect to our capital in this environment. George, to your comment about where can we expect we're going to look across and we'll continue to look across the ecosystem of opportunities. Our last acquisition was Enquizit that was in the cloud space, mostly focused in federal. So you can imagine some of those revenue streams would have a higher concentration than netted down. But I wouldn't per se that's part of our strategy. It's going to be more about the capabilities. So more to come on that front. Sure, Ruplu. So a few things. Number one, we've said before and we continue to say we would expect, as we look forward, that netted down revenues would outpace our overall net sales, if you will. So I'd say, give you that one data point. I will note that the mix into netted down this year has been more extreme and a couple of metrics that I'll just note; number one, netted down for the quarter of $400 million was 7% of our net sales, but 32.6% of our GP and you can go back sequentially and look at what that looked like. But it's notable both sequentially and I'd say, versus prior year. If you try to put those dollars on a more even basis with net sales that grows up, you'd get a sense for the impact. And I think, and Chris alluded to this, it would suggest that our decline in net sales is pretty considerably less than if you looked at it on this customer spend basis. So there are a couple of things you could look at from a math perspective that would show the pretty notable growth and outsized impact even down has had this year. Sure. Thanks, Adam. Great question. A couple of things I would call out. First, like I gave you the range how we think about expenses. Just understand kind of underneath the engine there, there are puts and takes in terms of the -- where are we driving productivity, where we're driving efficiency. Not only to kind of keep within that range, but also to make sure that we can appropriately fund investment opportunities. I think what you can expect is those efficiency efforts will continue, but we will continue to invest. And you noted that our headcount was slightly up, but it was up. If you look at the gross effect of the those -- that headcount would look at more significant, if you will, from a gross basis. So look, I think it's a balancing act. I think, Adam, as we start to see the demand cycle start to turn in some of the areas we've talked about we would certainly accelerate and continue to ramp-up on the investment side. But I would call the efficiency efforts somewhat evergreen. And so therefore, when you add that up, we're still going to try to remain within a range. I would not be able to tell you definitively every quarter, if we show operating leverage, there could be some quarters where we say there was a great opportunity. And therefore, we have less operating leverage or de-lever but it's going to be a big quarter-to-quarter with kind of that strategic balance that I mentioned on top of that. Yeah, absolutely, Adam. So I've talked about in the past, obviously, mix matters, and we've had a pretty extreme mix movement particularly this year on these netted down revenues in lieu of hardware, PCs, et cetera. Certainly, we would expect that to balance out over time. And so that is a variable that would dilute gross margins. The other piece, Adam, would be that in general, product margins have held very firm. And if you look back over the last two years, they've actually moved up quite a bit. So there's been resiliency there. I would also note that though in that, there is this component of more upmarket premium spend on higher level, higher value product that is persisting, and we're seeing that continue to hold up. And there may be an element there that what you bought in the way of premium product. Now you're in it and you're going to continue to invest in that same way. And then the last component, Adam, I would note, and we know this, that over time, you could see commoditization. We've not seen that, but it's conceivable that some of that could come back over time. So we are at pretty significant levels in terms of gross margin when you add those components up. Certainly, components that I referenced that are durable and in some areas, some components that could be somewhat transitory and we could see at a bit over time."

I'll begin today's call as usual with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and our views on the second half of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our team executed extremely well in a market facing persistent challenges. As expected, commercial top line remained under pressure and public returned to more normal seasonality. For the quarter, the team delivered net sales of $5.6 billion, down 9% in U.S. dollars, down 8% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income of $530 million was up 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.56 was up 3%. These results demonstrate the power of our resilient business model when coupled with our broad and deep portfolio of technology solutions. In an ongoing period of economic uncertainty, our ability to drive outcomes and address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum enabled the team to pivot to where our customers need us most. An ability that reflects the impact of strategic investments we have made to enhance our high relevance and high growth solutions and services. While transactional business remained under pressure, increases in solutions contributed to meaningful margin expansion. Margin expansion that together with ongoing expense discipline, delivered strong profitability. Let's take a look at this quarter's key performance drivers. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Each of our five sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education is a meaningful business on its own, with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act counter cyclically given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each. Our second quarter results provide an excellent example of this. Economic uncertainty continued to weigh on the commercial market and both our corporate and small business results reflected ongoing cautious customer behavior, caution that once again drove elongated sales cycles, smaller deal sizes and greater focus on mission critical projects. Caution that also drove customer focus on short-term ROI with both corporate and small business posting double digit increases in cloud spend. For corporate overall sales declined 16%. Mission critical projects continue to move forward and slowly ticked up throughout the quarter. Large commercial customer spending sequentially improved. Continued postponement of upgrades and utilization of existing product resulted in a double digit decline in client devices. Well, we remain cautious on the outlook for client devices. Corporate delivered its first sequential volume increase in the past four quarters providing some indication of demand stability. Notably, client device ASP's held buoyed by mix into higher value, higher functionality units. Momentum around projects focused on increased productivity and enhanced customer and coworker experiences and that drove excellent growth in cloud spend. Implementation of network modernization projects delivered double digit Netcom growth. Small business declined 21%, reflecting the impact of ongoing caution by economically sensitive customers. Client devices continued to decline, with upgrades on hold pending greater clarity around the economy and employment. Focus on mission critical priorities around security and efficiency drove double digit customer spend increases in both cloud and software. Public performance partially mitigated commercial market pressure and was seasonally higher than the first quarter. Sales increased 2% year-over-year with strong performance in government, another quarter of stable performance in healthcare and an upturn in education. Government increased 12% and continued to benefit from strategic efforts to target complex services enabled hybrid infrastructure and cloud opportunities. Federal delivered double digit growth in the quarter, largely driven by the team's ability to help agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This delivered excellent net common storage performance. Legacy Sirius relationships contributed to significant growth in services. The state and local team also delivered double digit growth. Excellent services performance reflected the team's success, helping state and local municipalities address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagement. Cloud adoption drove strong software and security performance. Healthcare performance was relatively flat. Talent needs and data center projects remained focus areas as customers increasingly leveraged technology to address complex industry challenges. Customer hesitancy around cloud continued to dissipate and adoption increased meaningfully in the quarter. Client devices remained under pressure given ongoing customer focus on mission critical projects that deliver short-term return on investment.\netcom,: Client devices were flat as the volume decline was offset by mix into higher value units which drove strong ASP performance. For K12, the team continued their success executing on infrastructure opportunities and delivered excellent growth in services netcom and storage. This quarter, the team also delivered a sequential improvement in client devices. As you know, the summer season represents the height of K12 buying. With our June 30 quarter end, we occasionally see anticipated summer sales hit the end of the second quarter. We experienced this in the quarter with anticipated back half refresh driving a significant sequential improvement. Refresh driven by aging devices and higher than historical breakage rates given more students take their devices off campus. Other, our combined UK and Canada business declined 7%. Similar to the U.S., each team continued to execute well and sustained profitability improvements under challenging conditions. UK posted a low single digit decline in local currency, while Canada declined by low double digits. We're seeing growing customer caution in both the UK and Canada, similar to what we heard from U.S. commercial customers a quarter ago. As you can see, the diversity of end market growth this quarter demonstrates the benefit of the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Category performance demonstrates the benefit of our second performance driver, our broad and deep portfolio of products and solutions, which enables the team to pivot and support customers wherever needed. Ongoing economic uncertainty in the commercial space continued to have an outsized impact on both transactions and solutions. While the rate of decline moderated, transactions were down double digits. Solutions performance improved with mid-single digit growth versus flat performance in the first quarter. Similar to the first quarter, all three of our portfolio categories, hardware, software and services were impacted by commercial pressure with deferral of major hardware projects resulting in lower volumes in services and solutions. Hardware decreased 11% year-on-year. Client device performance in the commercial space significantly impacted hardware performance and corporate continued to have the greatest category impact. Netcom had an exceptional quarter, posting meaningful increases across all customer end markets. This strong performance was largely driven by improvements in supply and continued work on customer's network modernization projects. Services were relatively flat year-on-year. Growth varied widely with strength tied to channel specific customer priorities, offset by services attached to transactional and solutions hardware. Professional services were solid and while managed services activity was solid, given extended sales cycles and ratable revenue streams, the impact on net sales was minimal. Software customer span increased by mid-single digits driven by mix into software-as-a-service. Double digit increases in network management software and database software were offset by continued declines in software categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels and net sales decreased at a mid-single digit rate. Security remained a key focus area for customers with spend up single digits. Top growth categories included endpoint security, e-mail security, identity management and physical security. Security associated with growth and business expansion remained challenged. Once again, cloud was an important driver of performance across the business contributing meaningfully gross profit. Productivity, infrastructure-as-a-service and security were the top three workloads in the quarter. Each of our customer end markets posted double digit increases in cloud, customer spend and gross profit. Profitable growth that was enabled by the strategic investments both organic and acquired that we've made in cloud capabilities over the past 10 years, capabilities that enable us to deliver for our customers and our stakeholders. And this leads to the final driver, our performance in the quarter, our three-part strategy for growth which is to first acquire new customers and capture share, second enhance our solutions capabilities and third expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage the integrated technology solutions our customers want and need today and in the future. Our investment in data analytics is a great example of this strategy and action. Like many of our strategic investments, data analytics delivers value across all three pillars. Our data analytics capabilities are underpinned by the intimate knowledge we have about our customers, knowledge earned through deep and long lasting relationships which range on average over 12 years. They are also underpinned by our broad and comprehensive product portfolio, which provides extensive historical information about buying patterns across industries and verticals. This proprietary customer and product knowledge powers our data analytics that helps create robust and data-driven predictive models, models that identify customer needs and create personalized and targeted outreach to drive tailored services, products and solutions, solutions that help our customers accelerate their strategies and achieve their missions. We continue to invest in the breadth and performance of these models utilizing machine learning and other advanced analytics techniques and have produced tangible lift in sales conversion and market relevancy. Clearly our investments in data analytics are delivering for CDW. They are also delivering for our customers. Today we have significant data analytics expertise across server, database, model construction and training, expertise that delivers outcomes in our ICARE framework, particularly in the areas of innovation, agility and experience, expertise that bolsters our consultative professional services capabilities including our AI consulting practice. For CDW, AI adoption feels very much like other transformative technologies of the past. Customers recognize the evolutionary benefits of AI, yet they face incredible complexity and choice, complexity and choice that plays to our strengths and our value proposition as a trusted partner and advisor. And just as we have in the past, we have made and will continue to make the investments necessary to ensure we are ready, ready to lead the market and ready to help our customers maximize the return on their AI investments, another excellent example of how we strategically invest for today and the future. And that leads me to the expectations for the balance of the year. You'll recall on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for the U.S. IT market to post a decline of high single digits in 2023. This assumed a moderate improvement in the commercial environment in the back half of the year and a return to normal seasonality in the public space. To date, the demand environment has been consistent with our expectations and our view of the U.S. IT market remains unchanged. Within this environment, we continue to target outperforming the U.S. IT market by 200 to 300 basis points on an organic constant currency basis. Wildcards remain the macro environment, further tightening of credit and the potential for federal government budget disruptions. And as we always do, we'll provide an updated perspective on business conditions as we move through the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to do what we do best, leverage our competitive advantages and out execute the competition. We will also continue to judiciously invest to ensure we are there for our customers so they can achieve their mission critical outcomes today and in the future. I hope you can tell from my comments that this quarter's performance reinforced our confidence that we have the right strategy in place, a strategy that serves us well when confronted with macro or end market specific challenges, a strategy designed to ensure we remain our customers partner of choice and most importantly, a strategy that enables us to continue to deliver excellent cash flows and profitably outgrow the market. With that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more details on our financial performance. Al?\nAlbert Miralles: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 7, consolidated net sales were $5.6 billion, down 8.5% on a reported and average daily sales basis. Second quarter net sales were up 10.2% versus the first quarter on a reported and average daily sales basis, ahead of our outlook which had anticipated a mid-single digit seasonal increase. Broadly speaking, our expectation held that the first quarter's uncertain macro environment would persist with our commercial performance coming in as we expected while public moderately exceeded our expectations. Public results were driven by the strength and solutions performance across channels and the impact of some early shipping of anticipated client device refresh volume in K12, leading to return to year-over-year growth and the strongest sequential growth for this segment since Q2 2020. On the supply side, the dollar value of our backlog declined relative to the first quarter, which contributed to our stronger solutions performance. Backlogs and product lead times associated with transactional products ended the quarter essentially in line with more normal historical levels, while remaining supply chain challenges and netcom solutions continued to ease in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the remaining pockets of backlog to weather out over time. As always, we judiciously managed our working capital to support our customers while ensuring strong economic returns. Our year-to-date free cash flow performance, which we will discuss shortly, reflects this discipline. Our team delivered strong profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 1.1%. Record second quarter gross margin of 21% was up 200 basis points year-over-year and increase in transactional product volume had a mild impact on margins compared to the first quarter, but overall margins remain strong driving a year-over-year gross profit increase despite lower net sales. As a reminder, the record gross margin performance in recent quarters has principally been driven by two factors; first, product margins benefiting from both mix into complex solutions and a lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, a greater mix into netted down revenues, the category again outpaced overall net sales, growing 10% in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022, primarily driven by double digit software-as-a-service growth. Netted down sales represented 31% of our gross profit compared to 28% in the prior year second quarter. This continues to be an important trend within our business. Turning to expenses on Slide 8, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $652 million for the quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, prior year quarter non-GAAP SG&A was flat as increased payroll expense associated with modestly higher co-worker count was offset by the prudent managed management of discretionary expenses during the quarter. Coworker account at the end of the second quarter was approximately 14,900, down from the first quarter, principally due to our efforts to align our cost structure with the level of business demand, while continuing to prioritize the areas where we can provide the most value to our customers. Strategic investments in our solutions and services capabilities remain key to our three-part strategy for growth and important catalyst for the achievement of our profitability and margin goals. GAAP operating income was $412 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $530 million, up $14 million or 2.6% versus the prior year. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was larger than usual, primarily the result of the workplace optimization charge in the quarter which is detailed on slides 8 and 11:00. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached a record second quarter record of 9.4%, up 100 basis points from the prior year and up 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. We remain laser focused on delivering leverage on our gross profit growth despite challenging market conditions. Moving to Slide 9, interest expense was $58 million, approximately flat to the prior year and relatively in line with our expectations. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 10 was 25.7%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $91 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-gap net income add backs as shown on the slide 11. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9% within our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5%. As you can see on Slide 12, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares of 136 million GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.92. Our non-GAAP net income was $349 million in the quarter, up 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.56, up 3.2%. Moving ahead to Slide 13, at period end, cash and cash equivalents were $204 million and net debt was $5.6 billion. During the quarter, net debt was relatively flat, consistent with our plan to maintain our net leverage ratio within the range of 2 to 3 times. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.2 billion. Moving to slide 14, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 14 days, down four days from the first quarter, five days from the prior year's second quarter and below our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our continued diligent management of working capital, particularly with respect to inventory. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital favorably or unfavorably in any given quarter. We continue to believe our target range remains the best guidepost for modeling future working capital. Our effective working Capital Management also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $684 million as shown on Slide 15. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $79 million to shareholders through dividends and $196 million in share repurchases. That brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 16. Our execution remained consistent with the updated objectives we communicated at the start of the year. First, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. Going forward we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place for the targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the second quarter at 2.6 times, flat to the end of the first quarter within our new range of 2 to 3 times. We continue to convert cash profits into cash flow and have rigorous process in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining our flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we continue to target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 17. We continue to see caution and prudence in the market and in the sentiment of our customers. Given this, there is no change to our previously shared expectation that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. Our baseline view incorporates a modest recovery in the second half of 2023. We have not seen indications that would suggest a major turnaround on our commercial channels otherwise. With this scenario as our baseline, we maintain our expectation and outgrow the market by 200 to 300 basis points and continue to anticipate that netted down revenues will grow faster than other products and solution categories. Keep in mind in times of hardware softness, our over performance tends to be on the lower end of this range and vice versa. We also continue to expect a neutral currency impact for the full year, modest tailwinds in the second half after seeing modest headwinds in the first half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.24 to the British pound and CAD0.77 for the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to continue to be in the range of 9%. This reflects our expectation of continued strong gross profit margin with modest softening following three straight quarterly gross margin records. Operating margin is also supported by our actions to better align expenses. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of flat year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an increase from our prior expectation reflective of our better than expected second quarter results. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook and a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense and the non- GAAP effective tax rates can be found on Slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts of the third quarter, for average daily sales, we expect mid-single digits sequential growth from Q2 to Q3. This equates to a mid-single digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline for the fourth quarter in terms of average daily sales. As noted, we anticipate gross profit and [indiscernible] margins to be below second quarter levels, driven by both mix and rate elements. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. In 2023, we expect full year free cash flow to be approximately 5% of net sales, above our rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5% and reflecting our strong cash generation in the first half of the year. While we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain market, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability, margins and cash flow to our stakeholders. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we've provided updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. If you could just talk a little bit about seasonality, I know you guys have guided for the third quarter and as you look into the fourth quarter, there's a lot of debate on whether the pull in, incline devices for the second quarter is going to result in below seasonal growth for the second half, that's on the client devices side, and just generally a lot of caution on other hardware spend, whether it's on the compute or storage side just given a cautious spending environment and shift towards AI. So if you could provide me what you're seeing in the channels and then your end customers that would be great. And then I just have a follow up on free cash flow as well. It's -- you're looking like it's pretty strong for this year. How should we think about potential acquisition and a boost to the growth rates that you guys have outlined for this year? Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Well good morning, Asiya. It's good to have you on the line. So let me just say with regard to expectations for the last half of the year and this concept of pull forward, look the quarter played out very much as we anticipated with commercial still feeling some pressures due to market sentiment and market caution and public returning to seasonality with somewhat over delivery by our government and education groups. Look if I take a step back and I think about Q2 versus the first -- the second half, let me just say this, I'm encouraged by the tick up that we saw at the end of the second quarter with regard to commercial customers in both activity and sentiment. I am encouraged by public returning to that seasonality that feels much more normalized as compared to pre-COVID for example. I'm encouraged by the fact that our international team notwithstanding sales decline maintained their profitability progress that they're making. I'm encouraged frankly that small business feels like it is not getting any worse. It's kind of hovering around the bottom, it's not getting any better, but it's not getting worse. So there are a lot of things that encourage me. I'm impressed with the execution of this team frankly. They always pull through in tough environments and they did it again. All that said, we are still cautious, we're cautious and we got a one month into the quarter where we felt an uptick, so we're cautious about the back end. And what I would say is, we still believe that we are starting to and will continue to see a mild-to-moderate recovery in the back end and we're holding firm to that. I mentioned K12 and we had a little bit more in the second quarter than we might have anticipated, that's just straddling quarters. That's just a phenomenon, but we're not seeing anything that is causing us to believe that the second half is going to be any different than we're suggesting in our outlook. And we're getting this from our customers with 10,000 plus sales folks and sales professionals and technologists in market, we're getting a real time pull and it feels like a pretty solid outlook to us.\nAlbert Miralles: And Asiya, maybe I would just put this is out, maybe just add the just kind of to give you the technical component with our Q2 delivery and kind of allocation across the channels, Q3 would essentially look seasonal, that is obviously it's the seasonal peak for public, and we'd expect that would play out. And what we experienced from the commercial channels for Q3 would look much like Q2. So when we think about that pickup of activity, modest recovery, probably a little bit more weighted towards Q4 in those segments that have been softer in the last few quarters.\nChristine Leahy: And you had a follow-up, Asiya, on free cash flow?\nAsiya Merchant: Yes, just on the free cash flow. Yes, it's obviously trending higher than what you guys had previously anticipated or guided to. How should we think about the use of cash here?\nAlbert Miralles: Yes, great question. So we've had -- look, we've had a good run of four plus quarters on the free cash flow generation side. And look, driven by strong cash profits, Asiya, but also by pretty diligent management of working capital in an environment that's been challenging. And I say look, on an evergreen basis, you'd expect that we will continue to be judicious about working capital, but certainly, there's a countercyclical component to this. And so as the environment has been a bit softer, we've been tighter in that regard. As we look to the second half and we look to pick up, and particularly in the transactional side, it's reasonable to believe that there'd be a bit of a more pull on our working capital in the second half. And notably, you'll see from our cash conversion that much of that favorability has come on the inventory side. So we're trying to make a little space for an expectation of pulling a bit more on working capital in the second half. That being said, for the full year, we gave you a refreshed rule of thumb of 4 to 4.5, and we expect it will come out for the full year at 5. And then just to your latter point on M&A and otherwise, look, we're going to utilize our capital where we see best, both supporting our strategic objectives, but also where the best relative value is.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start, it looks like kind of the old CDW that we've come to know and expect in terms of over-delivering relative to expectation is back this quarter. So at a high level, Chris, prior to this quarter, we had two quarters that were very different from plan in Q4 and Q1. I just would be curious for investors that are wondering what changed in Q2 from either a guidance process or what enabled the over-deliverance that we can kind of get confidence that the old CDW is back moving forward?\nChristine Leahy: Well, good morning Adam, I appreciate that. Look, I'd say a couple of things. The macro environment really had a significant impact on Q1 and Q2, well, Q1 and in the front end of Q2. And when you think about the challenges to our larger commercial customers, in particular, which have an oversized impact on the whole of the business, I would say that, number one, was the first driver. The second is we weren't -- we were anticipating a return to seasonality for the education space and the government space, but as you know, those are really the summertime in the third and fourth quarter, as Al mentioned. So as we sat in Q1, we had a tough economic environment impacting our large commercial customers and our public sector just couldn't quite make it up. What you're seeing now is the benefit of the counter-cyclicality and the difference and diversity of our end markets really coming into full play. So it was and I would call it timing to some extent and the macro environment. I'd also say, Adam, that we are seeing this somewhat of a stability. I'll use the question a little bit of stability. I mentioned client devices are still down, but first quarter of sequential increase in commercial, K-12 is still down, but delivered very nicely in the quarter. And we're starting to see on the commercial side, in particular, a little bit of uptick in sentiment. That's giving us some optimism. And then you had the execution of this team, as you know very well. This team executes like nobody else. And given the change in the market we're seeing happening in back to seasonality, we're just going after it and leveraging our competitive advantages. And customers have been holding off on spending for a long time. So as they start to loosen the reins a little bit, we have been there, and we'll be there for them.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. And maybe just a follow-up for Al on guidance, just a little bit more in-the-weeds question here. Your Q3 guidance, I think you said mid-single digits sequentially per day, which if I look back historically, that's kind of seasonal, like you said. As I think about Q3, that's typically a big public sector, particularly government quarter, but you also had a very strong public sector result during Q2. So I guess the question would be what gives you confidence that there wasn't pull-in during Q2 in public sector and why guide mid-single digits in Q3 or that seasonal based on that strong Q2 result. Thanks.\nAlbert Miralles: Yes, sure. Thanks, Adam, for the question. You're right, Q2 is really strong and particularly in public segment. All of the data that we see in the pipeline that we evaluate ongoing would suggest there's continued strength there. And I'd say, notably, in the government side and as well higher end that really had strong performance in the quarter. We mentioned, Adam, that K-12 had some, I'll call it, kind of summer seasonal pickup in activity, which some of which we might typically see kind of straddle over to Q3. So there's probably a little bit of that showed up in Q2, but modest enough that we feel comfortable holding to the expectation of seasonal uptick in public overall.\nAdam Tindle: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks and congrats on the results.\nChristine Leahy: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. And in terms Chris, your commentary about seeing at least a modest recovery in the commercial markets in Q4, based on what you're hearing from customers, do you see any sort of PC refresh or is that more on the infrastructure and solutions side where projects getting pushed out will get done?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Matt, it's a great question. We've been all asking ourselves this for a long time, when our PC is going to start to come back and that, as we all know, is really tied to the market and projects that are related to growth initiatives within organizations and employment. And look, I think that the farm has not yet been cleared and I don't think our customers yet are on the kind of solid footing of they're ready to open the coffer, so to speak. They're still being incredibly judicious in their spending. They're scrutinizing relentlessly, frankly. And so what we're hearing is more focused around mission critical, and I'll call that more solutions oriented endeavors right now. So it's hard to gauge on the PC refresh and when we'll start to see it come back. That said, look, we all know that the PCs are the productivity tool, right? They're what connect people to the applications. I think we all agree on that. We also know that we've got devices that are sitting old in the system. We talked about K-12 as an example, two to three years old, breakage five times higher than it was pre-pandemic, frankly. And Win 11 is right around the corner. Now you heard us talk about ASPs and customers buying devices that are kind of higher functionality, higher productivity, those would be Win 11 devices. So we do see customers starting to explore the benefits of Win 11, and that's going to set in at some point, and that's going to be a nice tailwind. Whether it will be Q3, Q4, 2024, it feels a little longer term than this year.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thank you. And on the Infrastructure & Advanced Solutions side, I guess there's some concern that we're seeing backlog across many companies come down because of component availability, product availability is much better now. And then also as customers maybe refresh servers, they move to a cloud model. I guess that would benefit you. But are you seeing any signs of any of those things playing out?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. So on the networking side, we certainly saw a healthy flush this quarter, and I would say that we had double-digit growth across all of our customer segments, and that was largely due to backlog flush and continuation of network modernization projects. In terms of the movement to cloud and AI, look, I would just say that this is a topic of conversation. I've used the word frenzy before, but it's a topic of conversation and as I said in my prepared remarks, there's a lot of complexity. There are a lot of questions out there. What will it drive? And what I would just say, Matt is, look, the benefit of our broad portfolio and the investments we've made across high growth type solutions areas as well as the services capabilities in particular, position us well to support customers wherever they are on the IT spectrum and whatever they're buying. So in any case, I do really see the customer decisions benefiting CDW because we'll benefit them with the portfolio and our capabilities.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks and congrats on a nice sprint here. I guess, Chris, I want to kind of go back to this question around the June quarter upside that you folks are seeing, but you're still not -- you're not really raising the full year guide, I guess. So I'd love to maybe just go back to this and understand what are you seeing in the back half that refrains you from perhaps taking up the full year guide at least to reflect the upside design in June. So was it a bit of a pull in? Is it conservative? Just I'd love to understand given the big beat in June, what refrains you from raising the full year guide?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Amit, thanks for the question. Here's what I'd say. I'd say too early too call. We're taking it quarter-by-quarter right now. On the commercial side, there's still caution, there's still prudence. There's no doubt that's still sitting in the market, notwithstanding, as I said, slight uptick as we get to the end of the quarter. So a couple of weeks, a month of a quarter does not -- was going to say trend make, but it really doesn't create solid ground yet. So we have to give it a little more time. I see some good indicators, but they're just not enough to make the call. So moderate feels better to us than major turnaround. On the public side, look, the way that both education and government work is we track very early in the year. So in the first quarter, we're tracking the projects that are coming in. So we have very good visibility to seasonality and generally what's going to happen during the strong seasonality. K-12 has been strong, and it's delivering. Having some of that come in, in June in our second quarter versus third quarter, we're not worried because we actually are seeing a real uptick in refresh needs. We talked a couple of years ago about the breakage rates and how that was going to drive refresh, well it is. And on the public side, it's looking very, very normal to us. So we don't want to get ahead of our skis on either commercial or public. We're just kind of calling it as we see it as we rounded out the quarter. So that's what I'd say. I don't know Al, if you want to add anything?\nAlbert Miralles: Yes. I would just echo Chris' versus comments there and just say, Amit that, look, we had called for in the last quarter a modest recovery based on the information we had at that time. Q2 did come in a bit stronger. We're now effectively saying Q3 looks seasonal, and Q4 ultimately look above seasonal on that expectation of a pickup. And so there are still plenty of puts and takes that could call that into question, but we're comfortable overall with what we're seeing and kind of all of the data that we evaluate. That pickup is appropriate, but certainly wouldn't expect at this point that it's going to be much more of a churn than that.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect, thank you. And then I guess, Al, maybe if I could ask you this question. Gross margins are up fairly nicely, I think, 140 basis points in the first half of this year versus last year. And you touched on a couple of things that are helping you there, but maybe you can talk about how much of an uplift do you think is cyclical in nature of the fact that the PCs are down a lot versus things that might be a bit more structural in nature. I'd love to just understand how do you think about gross margin run rate as you go forward from here? Thank you.\nAlbert Miralles: Yes, sure, Amit. So you're right. Look, 2022, we ended 2022 with gross margins of just shy of 20%, which were new record levels, and we're up from there. if I had to parse it kind of year-over-year Amit, I think it's both a combination of, I'll call it, kind of thematic components of netted down revenue and that continued growth there, right? So particularly focused in cloud, SaaS, security, if you will. So we do think there are durable themes there. But there have also been factors driven by both mix and rate. So on the mix side, obviously, the tough environment has shifted more customer spend into solutions, which come at and services, which come at higher margin. So we have good reason to believe that, that could/would balance out over time. And when that does and particularly with client on it, you could see some moderation there. And then on the rate side, look, I've talked a couple of quarters now about product margins being firm and they've held up and even in this quarter, continue to hold up, and some of that is, I'd say a more durable theme from all indications of customers going a bit up market in terms of kind of products, but also, it's just been a really firm environment, I think, substantially driven by supply chain. So there are some of the puts and takes. So look, we feel good overall. We're holding to our NUI [ph] margin of 9% for the full year, but it's reasonable to expect that you could soften a bit here on gross margin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. Thank you. Good morning guys. Congrats on the quarter. Chris, I was wondering if you could just maybe elaborate on some of the pricing dynamics you are seeing in the market today, meaning are discounts accelerating? And if so, where conversely, are you pulling back on any discounting? How are customers responding to any pricing changes? How do you expect that to trend into the second half? Just broadly, any incremental color you could share on pricing would be helpful. Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Let me start, Erik, with you know that we're a price plus model, right? So you're familiar with that model. If the prices, the OEM prices go up, we're usually passing that on to the customer, but let me set that that aside for a second. Let me -- I would characterize it as follows. I would say that pricing is holding fairly firm in an intensely competitive market. And I'd say that and give credit to the team that is reflecting to the customer the value that the CDW is delivering. But I will acknowledge that we're in a very intensely competitive environment. And when you think about the levels of scrutiny and all the things we've talked about in terms of purchasing processes right now, there's a lot of getting it out. That said, ASPs are holding pretty firm for CDW and what happens in the second half, I would expect the market to remain competitive. But I would expect also that the value that we, for example, wrap around client devices when they come back more robustly, that really resonates with customers, and I would expect us to hold ASPs pretty darn firm.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. That is super helpful. And then I'd love to follow up again with you. Just on some of the nuances or comparing and contrasting a bit what you're hearing from the existing MedLar [ph] the Corporate clients versus the smaller SMBs, just any differences or similarities that you're hearing from them, maybe slightly nuance, but anything that you could call out would be super helpful. Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yes. No problem, Erik. Here's what I would say, small businesses are acting like small business. They're the most highly sensitive to the economy and in particular, hiring, right? And so right now, without -- again, the fog hasn't cleared. Without more clarity around the economy and potential for growth and hiring, they're kind of in a bit of a hold position except for those mission-critical projects that are productivity related, that are security related, that are frankly, even a little lower cost because we're talking about cloud versus large hardware purchases. Interest rates have really impacted that group of customers in terms of access to capital, and we're seeing that. I do think we've stabilized there kind of at the bottom, as I said. The difference when we look at the larger commercial customers, first quarter to now, we talked about first quarter that large commercial customer being what was the real drag, if you will, on the overall results. Those are the customers we've started to actually see the uptick in. So think about the last month of the quarter, starting to see movement back to mission-critical projects, the things that were on delay. That's where we're actually seeing some stability and sequential increase in client devices. So the difference is the small businesses, they're going to be a little longer to get -- kind of get back on the major buying page. Those larger entities are starting to inch back in and that's what's giving us -- that's one input to the confidence we have in the back end of the year. Does that help?\nErik Woodring: That's -- yes, that's super helpful. Thank you so much and congrats again. Thanks guys.\nChristine Leahy: Yes, thanks Erik.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Chris, maybe to some extent, following up here on Erik's question about what you're hearing from customers. With supply generally improving, is the visibility that customers are providing you or even the heads-up in terms of like heads up around projects that they're planning, is that starting to come in and sort of get compressed a bit more? What are you seeing on that front? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yes. I mean, Samik, that would be some of it. We think about activity, right? We think about quoting. We think about the activity we track in our CRM system. We think about, obviously, invoicing and writings. But we -- all of those activities with the customer is what drives our kind of pipeline analysis to inform what is coming and what we think is coming down the pipe. So back to those kind of mission critical, we are starting to see some of those loosen up, which means writing around those are ticking up slightly across the full stack related to solutions, for example. So the answer is, yes. It's about the activity that we triangulate with the customers and the conversations we're having.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. And if I can just ask more specifically to NetComm, that has continued to be an area of growth, but you did mention that you have continued to work down backlog. I think one of the questions we get often is, how sustainable can growth be once the backlog gets drawn down and normalized, any thoughts around that? I mean, are you expecting a similar pickup in NetComm sort of in the pipeline once spending recovers to a more normalized level? Or is backlog going to be a headwind in relation to growth?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. It's a fair question. Here's how I think about network modernization. There is a lot that is driving a continuous need for network modernization. Take any of the segments or customer end markets, higher and it's all about willing students, which means it's all about experience, which means their network has to be improved. When you think about kind of leveling into a hybrid work or back to work, that has major network requirements. It's basically if you tickle AI, frankly, as you're thinking about consulting and advising customers around AI use cases, that has network upgrade, if you will, modernization requirements. As we think about a refresh coming down the pike, that's going to have upgrade requirements. Our classrooms definitely are focused on modernization. So while the backlog was quite helpful to results this quarter, I don't expect that we're going to see network modernization dramatically slowdown in the near-term given the needs.\nAlbert Miralles: And Samik, this is Al. Just to maybe add one thing. What we experienced with the backlog with NetComm in the quarter was what we would call pretty orderly. We have been saying we expected that backlog would work its way down, and it did. So while it contributed to the performance for NetComm, certainly underneath there, there's still continued written demand, as Chris suggested.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it, okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Chris, can you talk a bit about what the discussions you're having with customers on AI? And what I'm curious about is, within your various customer segments, is there any that are sort of ahead? I don't know if I kind of doubt state and local would be. But how -- where people are in their AI discussions? Where maybe they're thinking about first deploying some of these generative AI solutions? And how you see it developing, because you have such a unique position in that you speak with so many various customer groups? Thank you.\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Sure, good morning Shannon. Yes, I guess when we think about AI, we think very simply two parts, two sides. First is the catalyst for CDW to accelerate and expand our own internal use cases, obviously. And then it's an opportunity to evolve our -- help our customers evolve using our services capabilities and transaction capabilities. It might sound very simplistic, but I'll tell you the way that we think about it is putting tools in the hands of coworkers and customers and taking the work out of the hands of coworkers and customers. I mean, it really does fall into those two buckets. And CDW's full stack approach allows us to help customers across the entire value chain from what I'll call the base to the tip. So think advisory services, right? And think applications, think modeling and tools, think computing and data structure that's required to run on all of that. And we are having conversations, I would say, on the advisory level, it's essentially its assessment, AI maturity, how do you use AI instances? How do you use data models? Do I want to use a private or [indiscernible], it's basically some of the basics. Application level, it's around the embedded AI tools that are there or coming and ensuring customers understand the benefits that they can accrue and then helping them consume and use those benefits and then modeling in tools and obviously, infrastructure required and the tools to create the use cases. You asked about particular industries. Look, I'd say contact center is a huge use case and it was a fast pickup in a number of industries, including financial services, retail, et cetera. We've seen a lot of activity there. Then you think about things like marketing transformation. You think about things like knowledge assistance and customer assistance. Those are the types of use cases that we're talking actively with customers about right now and that's really across industry. So think customer assistance, think retail, think food, think knowledge assistance, think financial services, et cetera. But those are the buckets that we're really starting to have conversations about in addition to what I would say more proprietary conversations with customers about specific ways that they can monetize, specific to their industry or to their organization. So that's what we're seeing right now. There's a lot of discussion, a lot of -- go ahead. Go ahead, Shannon.\nShannon Cross: Got you. I was just going to say, are you hearing from customers that like next year's budgets might expand because they're finding so much benefit from AI and it's so early in the investment cycle that they see their IT expenditures may be growing above trends? I know the trend right now is down, but in theory?\nChristine Leahy: Yes. Here's what I'd say about that. I would continue to think that our customers are at the front end of this discussion. We certainly have some, as I said, in a number with contact centers where we've already implemented solutions, and they're reaping the benefits. I think in the middle of the year right now, given the environment we're in, customers are not prepared to increase budgets as a result of AI for 2024 yet because we're in the midst of planning what their -- helping them plan what their 2024 looks like. Do I think over the last, over the next six to 18 months, customers are really going to understand the tremendous benefit? I call it evolutionary -- evolutional. It's transformative. It really is one of those technologies that is going to massively change how companies operate and the benefits they accrue. But I think we're going to have to wait and see a little bit longer to understand what that opportunity looks like and when it's going to come to fruition. But it will be there, in our view. It will absolutely be there.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will go to the line of Keith Housum with North Coast Research. Your line is now open.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys. Just a little bit broader question in terms of the M&A strategy. You guys made two acquisitions this year at least this year that we know of, Locus Recruiting and Enquizit. But perhaps can you just touch real quick on what both of those acquisitions add to you guys and how it makes CDW better going forward?\nChristine Leahy: Yes, sure. So both of the acquisitions were relatively small, didn't have a material impact on the financials, but I would be -- I would say, strategically write-down the fairway in our sweet spot. So the first one that I think that you're thinking of is Locus, which is a consulting company, and they're in what we call our talent orchestration space. So they help us to basically provide professional and managed services engineers so they expand our technical talent base period to end. And it's a way to have I'll call it, kind of a flexible burstable model across our technology resources. Locus actually doubled the size of that business in one fell swoop, and we're really delighted where actually we've seen very significant success, almost right out of the bat with Locus because we've been able to fill talent needs and talent orchestration needs with customers even more quickly around all of the important areas like networking cloud and security. Enquizit is the other one, the acquisition we made recently, also very exciting. They're AWS Premier Cloud, a service provider in the government and education and not for profit space. And they complement our existing digital velocity team. Think of what Enquizit does as professional services around application modernization and cloud migration. And they also have a proprietary tool that combines professional services with IP, which helps automate the migration process. So it's very unique to Enquizit and so far, that's gained a lot of traction in our federal space. So, two great acquisitions that we were delighted to bring into the family and already paying dividends.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude the question-and-answer session. So I will now pass the conference back over to CDW for closing remarks.\nChristine Leahy: Thank you. And I want to recognize before we close the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. You show the power of execution excellence every day and in every way. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you and to our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Al and I look forward to talking with you again next year. Signing off from [indiscernible]\nOperator: That concludes the CDW Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",

            "name": "Albert Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail on the second quarter, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our second quarter P&L on Slide 7, consolidated net sales were $5.6 billion, down 8.5% on a reported and average daily sales basis. Second quarter net sales were up 10.2% versus the first quarter on a reported and average daily sales basis, ahead of our outlook which had anticipated a mid-single digit seasonal increase. Broadly speaking, our expectation held that the first quarter's uncertain macro environment would persist with our commercial performance coming in as we expected while public moderately exceeded our expectations. Public results were driven by the strength and solutions performance across channels and the impact of some early shipping of anticipated client device refresh volume in K12, leading to return to year-over-year growth and the strongest sequential growth for this segment since Q2 2020. On the supply side, the dollar value of our backlog declined relative to the first quarter, which contributed to our stronger solutions performance. Backlogs and product lead times associated with transactional products ended the quarter essentially in line with more normal historical levels, while remaining supply chain challenges and netcom solutions continued to ease in the quarter. We continue to anticipate the remaining pockets of backlog to weather out over time. As always, we judiciously managed our working capital to support our customers while ensuring strong economic returns. Our year-to-date free cash flow performance, which we will discuss shortly, reflects this discipline. Our team delivered strong profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 1.1%. Record second quarter gross margin of 21% was up 200 basis points year-over-year and increase in transactional product volume had a mild impact on margins compared to the first quarter, but overall margins remain strong driving a year-over-year gross profit increase despite lower net sales. As a reminder, the record gross margin performance in recent quarters has principally been driven by two factors; first, product margins benefiting from both mix into complex solutions and a lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back into transactional products, we would expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, a greater mix into netted down revenues, the category again outpaced overall net sales, growing 10% in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022, primarily driven by double digit software-as-a-service growth. Netted down sales represented 31% of our gross profit compared to 28% in the prior year second quarter. This continues to be an important trend within our business. Turning to expenses on Slide 8, non-GAAP SG&A totaled $652 million for the quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, prior year quarter non-GAAP SG&A was flat as increased payroll expense associated with modestly higher co-worker count was offset by the prudent managed management of discretionary expenses during the quarter. Coworker account at the end of the second quarter was approximately 14,900, down from the first quarter, principally due to our efforts to align our cost structure with the level of business demand, while continuing to prioritize the areas where we can provide the most value to our customers. Strategic investments in our solutions and services capabilities remain key to our three-part strategy for growth and important catalyst for the achievement of our profitability and margin goals. GAAP operating income was $412 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $530 million, up $14 million or 2.6% versus the prior year. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was larger than usual, primarily the result of the workplace optimization charge in the quarter which is detailed on slides 8 and 11:00. Non-GAAP operating income margin reached a record second quarter record of 9.4%, up 100 basis points from the prior year and up 90 basis points compared to the first quarter. We remain laser focused on delivering leverage on our gross profit growth despite challenging market conditions. Moving to Slide 9, interest expense was $58 million, approximately flat to the prior year and relatively in line with our expectations. Our GAAP effective tax rate shown on Slide 10 was 25.7%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $91 million. To get to our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-gap net income add backs as shown on the slide 11. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9% within our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5%. As you can see on Slide 12, with second quarter weighted average diluted shares of 136 million GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.92. Our non-GAAP net income was $349 million in the quarter, up 2.8% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.56, up 3.2%. Moving ahead to Slide 13, at period end, cash and cash equivalents were $204 million and net debt was $5.6 billion. During the quarter, net debt was relatively flat, consistent with our plan to maintain our net leverage ratio within the range of 2 to 3 times. Liquidity remained strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.2 billion. Moving to slide 14, the three-month average cash conversion cycle was 14 days, down four days from the first quarter, five days from the prior year's second quarter and below our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our continued diligent management of working capital, particularly with respect to inventory. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics can influence working capital favorably or unfavorably in any given quarter. We continue to believe our target range remains the best guidepost for modeling future working capital. Our effective working Capital Management also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $684 million as shown on Slide 15. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $79 million to shareholders through dividends and $196 million in share repurchases. That brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 16. Our execution remained consistent with the updated objectives we communicated at the start of the year. First, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. Going forward we will continue to target a 25% payout ratio. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place for the targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the second quarter at 2.6 times, flat to the end of the first quarter within our new range of 2 to 3 times. We continue to convert cash profits into cash flow and have rigorous process in place to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining our flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we continue to target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 17. We continue to see caution and prudence in the market and in the sentiment of our customers. Given this, there is no change to our previously shared expectation that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. Our baseline view incorporates a modest recovery in the second half of 2023. We have not seen indications that would suggest a major turnaround on our commercial channels otherwise. With this scenario as our baseline, we maintain our expectation and outgrow the market by 200 to 300 basis points and continue to anticipate that netted down revenues will grow faster than other products and solution categories. Keep in mind in times of hardware softness, our over performance tends to be on the lower end of this range and vice versa. We also continue to expect a neutral currency impact for the full year, modest tailwinds in the second half after seeing modest headwinds in the first half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.24 to the British pound and CAD0.77 for the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L, we expect our full year non-GAAP operating income margin to continue to be in the range of 9%. This reflects our expectation of continued strong gross profit margin with modest softening following three straight quarterly gross margin records. Operating margin is also supported by our actions to better align expenses. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of flat year-over-year in constant currency. This reflects an increase from our prior expectation reflective of our better than expected second quarter results. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook and a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation, amortization, interest expense and the non- GAAP effective tax rates can be found on Slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts of the third quarter, for average daily sales, we expect mid-single digits sequential growth from Q2 to Q3. This equates to a mid-single digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline for the fourth quarter in terms of average daily sales. As noted, we anticipate gross profit and [indiscernible] margins to be below second quarter levels, driven by both mix and rate elements. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. In 2023, we expect full year free cash flow to be approximately 5% of net sales, above our rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5% and reflecting our strong cash generation in the first half of the year. While we continue to operate in a cautious and uncertain market, we remain confident in our ability to deliver profitability, margins and cash flow to our stakeholders. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we've provided updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you. And Asiya, maybe I would just put this is out, maybe just add the just kind of to give you the technical component with our Q2 delivery and kind of allocation across the channels, Q3 would essentially look seasonal, that is obviously it's the seasonal peak for public, and we'd expect that would play out. And what we experienced from the commercial channels for Q3 would look much like Q2. So when we think about that pickup of activity, modest recovery, probably a little bit more weighted towards Q4 in those segments that have been softer in the last few quarters. Yes, great question. So we've had -- look, we've had a good run of four plus quarters on the free cash flow generation side. And look, driven by strong cash profits, Asiya, but also by pretty diligent management of working capital in an environment that's been challenging. And I say look, on an evergreen basis, you'd expect that we will continue to be judicious about working capital, but certainly, there's a countercyclical component to this. And so as the environment has been a bit softer, we've been tighter in that regard. As we look to the second half and we look to pick up, and particularly in the transactional side, it's reasonable to believe that there'd be a bit of a more pull on our working capital in the second half. And notably, you'll see from our cash conversion that much of that favorability has come on the inventory side. So we're trying to make a little space for an expectation of pulling a bit more on working capital in the second half. That being said, for the full year, we gave you a refreshed rule of thumb of 4 to 4.5, and we expect it will come out for the full year at 5. And then just to your latter point on M&A and otherwise, look, we're going to utilize our capital where we see best, both supporting our strategic objectives, but also where the best relative value is. Yes, sure. Thanks, Adam, for the question. You're right, Q2 is really strong and particularly in public segment. All of the data that we see in the pipeline that we evaluate ongoing would suggest there's continued strength there. And I'd say, notably, in the government side and as well higher end that really had strong performance in the quarter. We mentioned, Adam, that K-12 had some, I'll call it, kind of summer seasonal pickup in activity, which some of which we might typically see kind of straddle over to Q3. So there's probably a little bit of that showed up in Q2, but modest enough that we feel comfortable holding to the expectation of seasonal uptick in public overall. Yes. I would just echo Chris' versus comments there and just say, Amit that, look, we had called for in the last quarter a modest recovery based on the information we had at that time. Q2 did come in a bit stronger. We're now effectively saying Q3 looks seasonal, and Q4 ultimately look above seasonal on that expectation of a pickup. And so there are still plenty of puts and takes that could call that into question, but we're comfortable overall with what we're seeing and kind of all of the data that we evaluate. That pickup is appropriate, but certainly wouldn't expect at this point that it's going to be much more of a churn than that. Yes, sure, Amit. So you're right. Look, 2022, we ended 2022 with gross margins of just shy of 20%, which were new record levels, and we're up from there. if I had to parse it kind of year-over-year Amit, I think it's both a combination of, I'll call it, kind of thematic components of netted down revenue and that continued growth there, right? So particularly focused in cloud, SaaS, security, if you will. So we do think there are durable themes there. But there have also been factors driven by both mix and rate. So on the mix side, obviously, the tough environment has shifted more customer spend into solutions, which come at and services, which come at higher margin. So we have good reason to believe that, that could/would balance out over time. And when that does and particularly with client on it, you could see some moderation there. And then on the rate side, look, I've talked a couple of quarters now about product margins being firm and they've held up and even in this quarter, continue to hold up, and some of that is, I'd say a more durable theme from all indications of customers going a bit up market in terms of kind of products, but also, it's just been a really firm environment, I think, substantially driven by supply chain. So there are some of the puts and takes. So look, we feel good overall. We're holding to our NUI [ph] margin of 9% for the full year, but it's reasonable to expect that you could soften a bit here on gross margin. And Samik, this is Al. Just to maybe add one thing. What we experienced with the backlog with NetComm in the quarter was what we would call pretty orderly. We have been saying we expected that backlog would work its way down, and it did. So while it contributed to the performance for NetComm, certainly underneath there, there's still continued written demand, as Chris suggested."

            "name": "Christine Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call as usual with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and our views on the second half of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We will move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Our team executed extremely well in a market facing persistent challenges. As expected, commercial top line remained under pressure and public returned to more normal seasonality. For the quarter, the team delivered net sales of $5.6 billion, down 9% in U.S. dollars, down 8% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating income of $530 million was up 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.56 was up 3%. These results demonstrate the power of our resilient business model when coupled with our broad and deep portfolio of technology solutions. In an ongoing period of economic uncertainty, our ability to drive outcomes and address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum enabled the team to pivot to where our customers need us most. An ability that reflects the impact of strategic investments we have made to enhance our high relevance and high growth solutions and services. While transactional business remained under pressure, increases in solutions contributed to meaningful margin expansion. Margin expansion that together with ongoing expense discipline, delivered strong profitability. Let's take a look at this quarter's key performance drivers. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Each of our five sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education is a meaningful business on its own, with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography, verticals and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales. These unique customer end markets often act counter cyclically given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each. Our second quarter results provide an excellent example of this. Economic uncertainty continued to weigh on the commercial market and both our corporate and small business results reflected ongoing cautious customer behavior, caution that once again drove elongated sales cycles, smaller deal sizes and greater focus on mission critical projects. Caution that also drove customer focus on short-term ROI with both corporate and small business posting double digit increases in cloud spend. For corporate overall sales declined 16%. Mission critical projects continue to move forward and slowly ticked up throughout the quarter. Large commercial customer spending sequentially improved. Continued postponement of upgrades and utilization of existing product resulted in a double digit decline in client devices. Well, we remain cautious on the outlook for client devices. Corporate delivered its first sequential volume increase in the past four quarters providing some indication of demand stability. Notably, client device ASP's held buoyed by mix into higher value, higher functionality units. Momentum around projects focused on increased productivity and enhanced customer and coworker experiences and that drove excellent growth in cloud spend. Implementation of network modernization projects delivered double digit Netcom growth. Small business declined 21%, reflecting the impact of ongoing caution by economically sensitive customers. Client devices continued to decline, with upgrades on hold pending greater clarity around the economy and employment. Focus on mission critical priorities around security and efficiency drove double digit customer spend increases in both cloud and software. Public performance partially mitigated commercial market pressure and was seasonally higher than the first quarter. Sales increased 2% year-over-year with strong performance in government, another quarter of stable performance in healthcare and an upturn in education. Government increased 12% and continued to benefit from strategic efforts to target complex services enabled hybrid infrastructure and cloud opportunities. Federal delivered double digit growth in the quarter, largely driven by the team's ability to help agencies implement more efficient solutions to manage and protect data. This delivered excellent net common storage performance. Legacy Sirius relationships contributed to significant growth in services. The state and local team also delivered double digit growth. Excellent services performance reflected the team's success, helping state and local municipalities address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagement. Cloud adoption drove strong software and security performance. Healthcare performance was relatively flat. Talent needs and data center projects remained focus areas as customers increasingly leveraged technology to address complex industry challenges. Customer hesitancy around cloud continued to dissipate and adoption increased meaningfully in the quarter. Client devices remained under pressure given ongoing customer focus on mission critical projects that deliver short-term return on investment. Well good morning, Asiya. It's good to have you on the line. So let me just say with regard to expectations for the last half of the year and this concept of pull forward, look the quarter played out very much as we anticipated with commercial still feeling some pressures due to market sentiment and market caution and public returning to seasonality with somewhat over delivery by our government and education groups. Look if I take a step back and I think about Q2 versus the first -- the second half, let me just say this, I'm encouraged by the tick up that we saw at the end of the second quarter with regard to commercial customers in both activity and sentiment. I am encouraged by public returning to that seasonality that feels much more normalized as compared to pre-COVID for example. I'm encouraged by the fact that our international team notwithstanding sales decline maintained their profitability progress that they're making. I'm encouraged frankly that small business feels like it is not getting any worse. It's kind of hovering around the bottom, it's not getting any better, but it's not getting worse. So there are a lot of things that encourage me. I'm impressed with the execution of this team frankly. They always pull through in tough environments and they did it again. All that said, we are still cautious, we're cautious and we got a one month into the quarter where we felt an uptick, so we're cautious about the back end. And what I would say is, we still believe that we are starting to and will continue to see a mild-to-moderate recovery in the back end and we're holding firm to that. I mentioned K12 and we had a little bit more in the second quarter than we might have anticipated, that's just straddling quarters. That's just a phenomenon, but we're not seeing anything that is causing us to believe that the second half is going to be any different than we're suggesting in our outlook. And we're getting this from our customers with 10,000 plus sales folks and sales professionals and technologists in market, we're getting a real time pull and it feels like a pretty solid outlook to us. And you had a follow-up, Asiya, on free cash flow? Well, good morning Adam, I appreciate that. Look, I'd say a couple of things. The macro environment really had a significant impact on Q1 and Q2, well, Q1 and in the front end of Q2. And when you think about the challenges to our larger commercial customers, in particular, which have an oversized impact on the whole of the business, I would say that, number one, was the first driver. The second is we weren't -- we were anticipating a return to seasonality for the education space and the government space, but as you know, those are really the summertime in the third and fourth quarter, as Al mentioned. So as we sat in Q1, we had a tough economic environment impacting our large commercial customers and our public sector just couldn't quite make it up. What you're seeing now is the benefit of the counter-cyclicality and the difference and diversity of our end markets really coming into full play. So it was and I would call it timing to some extent and the macro environment. I'd also say, Adam, that we are seeing this somewhat of a stability. I'll use the question a little bit of stability. I mentioned client devices are still down, but first quarter of sequential increase in commercial, K-12 is still down, but delivered very nicely in the quarter. And we're starting to see on the commercial side, in particular, a little bit of uptick in sentiment. That's giving us some optimism. And then you had the execution of this team, as you know very well. This team executes like nobody else. And given the change in the market we're seeing happening in back to seasonality, we're just going after it and leveraging our competitive advantages. And customers have been holding off on spending for a long time. So as they start to loosen the reins a little bit, we have been there, and we'll be there for them. Thanks, Adam. Yes. Matt, it's a great question. We've been all asking ourselves this for a long time, when our PC is going to start to come back and that, as we all know, is really tied to the market and projects that are related to growth initiatives within organizations and employment. And look, I think that the farm has not yet been cleared and I don't think our customers yet are on the kind of solid footing of they're ready to open the coffer, so to speak. They're still being incredibly judicious in their spending. They're scrutinizing relentlessly, frankly. And so what we're hearing is more focused around mission critical, and I'll call that more solutions oriented endeavors right now. So it's hard to gauge on the PC refresh and when we'll start to see it come back. That said, look, we all know that the PCs are the productivity tool, right? They're what connect people to the applications. I think we all agree on that. We also know that we've got devices that are sitting old in the system. We talked about K-12 as an example, two to three years old, breakage five times higher than it was pre-pandemic, frankly. And Win 11 is right around the corner. Now you heard us talk about ASPs and customers buying devices that are kind of higher functionality, higher productivity, those would be Win 11 devices. So we do see customers starting to explore the benefits of Win 11, and that's going to set in at some point, and that's going to be a nice tailwind. Whether it will be Q3, Q4, 2024, it feels a little longer term than this year. Yes. So on the networking side, we certainly saw a healthy flush this quarter, and I would say that we had double-digit growth across all of our customer segments, and that was largely due to backlog flush and continuation of network modernization projects. In terms of the movement to cloud and AI, look, I would just say that this is a topic of conversation. I've used the word frenzy before, but it's a topic of conversation and as I said in my prepared remarks, there's a lot of complexity. There are a lot of questions out there. What will it drive? And what I would just say, Matt is, look, the benefit of our broad portfolio and the investments we've made across high growth type solutions areas as well as the services capabilities in particular, position us well to support customers wherever they are on the IT spectrum and whatever they're buying. So in any case, I do really see the customer decisions benefiting CDW because we'll benefit them with the portfolio and our capabilities. Yes. Amit, thanks for the question. Here's what I'd say. I'd say too early too call. We're taking it quarter-by-quarter right now. On the commercial side, there's still caution, there's still prudence. There's no doubt that's still sitting in the market, notwithstanding, as I said, slight uptick as we get to the end of the quarter. So a couple of weeks, a month of a quarter does not -- was going to say trend make, but it really doesn't create solid ground yet. So we have to give it a little more time. I see some good indicators, but they're just not enough to make the call. So moderate feels better to us than major turnaround. On the public side, look, the way that both education and government work is we track very early in the year. So in the first quarter, we're tracking the projects that are coming in. So we have very good visibility to seasonality and generally what's going to happen during the strong seasonality. K-12 has been strong, and it's delivering. Having some of that come in, in June in our second quarter versus third quarter, we're not worried because we actually are seeing a real uptick in refresh needs. We talked a couple of years ago about the breakage rates and how that was going to drive refresh, well it is. And on the public side, it's looking very, very normal to us. So we don't want to get ahead of our skis on either commercial or public. We're just kind of calling it as we see it as we rounded out the quarter. So that's what I'd say. I don't know Al, if you want to add anything? Yes. Let me start, Erik, with you know that we're a price plus model, right? So you're familiar with that model. If the prices, the OEM prices go up, we're usually passing that on to the customer, but let me set that that aside for a second. Let me -- I would characterize it as follows. I would say that pricing is holding fairly firm in an intensely competitive market. And I'd say that and give credit to the team that is reflecting to the customer the value that the CDW is delivering. But I will acknowledge that we're in a very intensely competitive environment. And when you think about the levels of scrutiny and all the things we've talked about in terms of purchasing processes right now, there's a lot of getting it out. That said, ASPs are holding pretty firm for CDW and what happens in the second half, I would expect the market to remain competitive. But I would expect also that the value that we, for example, wrap around client devices when they come back more robustly, that really resonates with customers, and I would expect us to hold ASPs pretty darn firm. Yes. No problem, Erik. Here's what I would say, small businesses are acting like small business. They're the most highly sensitive to the economy and in particular, hiring, right? And so right now, without -- again, the fog hasn't cleared. Without more clarity around the economy and potential for growth and hiring, they're kind of in a bit of a hold position except for those mission-critical projects that are productivity related, that are security related, that are frankly, even a little lower cost because we're talking about cloud versus large hardware purchases. Interest rates have really impacted that group of customers in terms of access to capital, and we're seeing that. I do think we've stabilized there kind of at the bottom, as I said. The difference when we look at the larger commercial customers, first quarter to now, we talked about first quarter that large commercial customer being what was the real drag, if you will, on the overall results. Those are the customers we've started to actually see the uptick in. So think about the last month of the quarter, starting to see movement back to mission-critical projects, the things that were on delay. That's where we're actually seeing some stability and sequential increase in client devices. So the difference is the small businesses, they're going to be a little longer to get -- kind of get back on the major buying page. Those larger entities are starting to inch back in and that's what's giving us -- that's one input to the confidence we have in the back end of the year. Does that help? Yes, thanks Erik. Yes. I mean, Samik, that would be some of it. We think about activity, right? We think about quoting. We think about the activity we track in our CRM system. We think about, obviously, invoicing and writings. But we -- all of those activities with the customer is what drives our kind of pipeline analysis to inform what is coming and what we think is coming down the pipe. So back to those kind of mission critical, we are starting to see some of those loosen up, which means writing around those are ticking up slightly across the full stack related to solutions, for example. So the answer is, yes. It's about the activity that we triangulate with the customers and the conversations we're having. Yes. It's a fair question. Here's how I think about network modernization. There is a lot that is driving a continuous need for network modernization. Take any of the segments or customer end markets, higher and it's all about willing students, which means it's all about experience, which means their network has to be improved. When you think about kind of leveling into a hybrid work or back to work, that has major network requirements. It's basically if you tickle AI, frankly, as you're thinking about consulting and advising customers around AI use cases, that has network upgrade, if you will, modernization requirements. As we think about a refresh coming down the pike, that's going to have upgrade requirements. Our classrooms definitely are focused on modernization. So while the backlog was quite helpful to results this quarter, I don't expect that we're going to see network modernization dramatically slowdown in the near-term given the needs. Yes. Sure, good morning Shannon. Yes, I guess when we think about AI, we think very simply two parts, two sides. First is the catalyst for CDW to accelerate and expand our own internal use cases, obviously. And then it's an opportunity to evolve our -- help our customers evolve using our services capabilities and transaction capabilities. It might sound very simplistic, but I'll tell you the way that we think about it is putting tools in the hands of coworkers and customers and taking the work out of the hands of coworkers and customers. I mean, it really does fall into those two buckets. And CDW's full stack approach allows us to help customers across the entire value chain from what I'll call the base to the tip. So think advisory services, right? And think applications, think modeling and tools, think computing and data structure that's required to run on all of that. And we are having conversations, I would say, on the advisory level, it's essentially its assessment, AI maturity, how do you use AI instances? How do you use data models? Do I want to use a private or [indiscernible], it's basically some of the basics. Application level, it's around the embedded AI tools that are there or coming and ensuring customers understand the benefits that they can accrue and then helping them consume and use those benefits and then modeling in tools and obviously, infrastructure required and the tools to create the use cases. You asked about particular industries. Look, I'd say contact center is a huge use case and it was a fast pickup in a number of industries, including financial services, retail, et cetera. We've seen a lot of activity there. Then you think about things like marketing transformation. You think about things like knowledge assistance and customer assistance. Those are the types of use cases that we're talking actively with customers about right now and that's really across industry. So think customer assistance, think retail, think food, think knowledge assistance, think financial services, et cetera. But those are the buckets that we're really starting to have conversations about in addition to what I would say more proprietary conversations with customers about specific ways that they can monetize, specific to their industry or to their organization. So that's what we're seeing right now. There's a lot of discussion, a lot of -- go ahead. Go ahead, Shannon. Yes. Here's what I'd say about that. I would continue to think that our customers are at the front end of this discussion. We certainly have some, as I said, in a number with contact centers where we've already implemented solutions, and they're reaping the benefits. I think in the middle of the year right now, given the environment we're in, customers are not prepared to increase budgets as a result of AI for 2024 yet because we're in the midst of planning what their -- helping them plan what their 2024 looks like. Do I think over the last, over the next six to 18 months, customers are really going to understand the tremendous benefit? I call it evolutionary -- evolutional. It's transformative. It really is one of those technologies that is going to massively change how companies operate and the benefits they accrue. But I think we're going to have to wait and see a little bit longer to understand what that opportunity looks like and when it's going to come to fruition. But it will be there, in our view. It will absolutely be there. Yes, sure. So both of the acquisitions were relatively small, didn't have a material impact on the financials, but I would be -- I would say, strategically write-down the fairway in our sweet spot. So the first one that I think that you're thinking of is Locus, which is a consulting company, and they're in what we call our talent orchestration space. So they help us to basically provide professional and managed services engineers so they expand our technical talent base period to end. And it's a way to have I'll call it, kind of a flexible burstable model across our technology resources. Locus actually doubled the size of that business in one fell swoop, and we're really delighted where actually we've seen very significant success, almost right out of the bat with Locus because we've been able to fill talent needs and talent orchestration needs with customers even more quickly around all of the important areas like networking cloud and security. Enquizit is the other one, the acquisition we made recently, also very exciting. They're AWS Premier Cloud, a service provider in the government and education and not for profit space. And they complement our existing digital velocity team. Think of what Enquizit does as professional services around application modernization and cloud migration. And they also have a proprietary tool that combines professional services with IP, which helps automate the migration process. So it's very unique to Enquizit and so far, that's gained a lot of traction in our federal space. So, two great acquisitions that we were delighted to bring into the family and already paying dividends. Thank you. And I want to recognize before we close the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. You show the power of execution excellence every day and in every way. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you and to our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Al and I look forward to talking with you again next year. Signing off from [indiscernible]"

I'll begin with an overview of our results and our outlook, and Al will provide a deeper view into the financials as well as an overview of our capital allocation priorities, and then we'll move right to your questions.  Market conditions were turbulent with a marked down shift in demand as the quarter progressed, translating into lower business volume. For the first quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, 16% lower than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $434 million, down 6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.03, down 8%. While clearly not satisfied with these results, our excellent cash flow and record gross margin reinforce the durability of our underlying profitability and integrity of our strategy. So, let's take a look at what happened in the puts and takes of the quarter. First, what happened? In short, demand was weaker than anticipated in our commercial business. When we exited 2022, our forecast called for a moderate softening of IT demand in 2023 and a mid-single-digit year-over-year decline in first quarter sales. As the quarter progressed, IT demand weakened more than expected as a confluence of events intensified already heightened economic concerns and recession fears.  This led to a fairly rapid shift in customer behavior, most notably in our large commercial customers. Projects that drove cost reduction, productivity, and financial returns were prioritized. Project justification and budget scrutiny ruled the day. And although deals were not canceled, sales cycles elongated, written sales slowed, and deal sizes compressed. While all of this translated into lower sales, the value of the solutions we provided customers continue to grow. You see the impact of this on our gross margin momentum. Margins were consistent with last quarter with meaningful year-over-year expansion in each of our customer end markets.  But unlike the fourth quarter, our strong margins did not fully offset the magnitude of our net sales decline. Let's take a look at the puts and takes of the quarter by customer end market. Recall, we have five sales channels: Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government, and Education, each a meaningful business on its own, with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, the teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. Our commercial operations are organized around geographies, verticals, and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales.  These unique customer end markets often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each as was the case this quarter. The shift in large commercial customer behavior had an outsized impact on corporate results with sales down 17% year-over-year. Declines were particularly steep in client devices, servers, and storage. Three meaningful hardware categories that require capital outlays, outlays under pressure, and out of favor. The corporate team's success helping customers achieve ongoing network and application modernization led to excellent NetComm performance. up double digits.  Momentum continued around projects focusing on increasing productivity and enhancing customer and coworkers' experiences, which drove strong growth in cloud and software spend. The small business team posted another quarter of solutions growth, driven by success helping customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity, priorities that drove meaningful increases in cloud and software customer spend on pace with recent quarters. Network upgrade activity also drove a high single-digit increase in NetComm with resilience in demand for solutions, the gross margin of the small business channel continued to be accretive to overall margins. Strong solutions performance was more than offset by the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty on transactions and small business net sales declined 23%.  Public sales declined 12%. Performance in government and healthcare held firm as organizations called on CDW to help them extract more value out of their IT footprints while education remained under pressure. Solutions momentum in health care was strong, driven by continued success helping customers adopt technology to drive productivity as an offset to higher costs from rising labor and materials inflation. Cloud performance was excellent, hesitancy over privacy concerns waned and healthcare systems embraced the speed and efficiency that cloud solutions can deliver. Talent needs and data center projects remain focused areas, with customers increasingly using technology to address complex industry challenges. Patient care and patient experience continue to be mission-critical, driving ongoing investment in collaboration solutions. However, similar to our commercial markets greater focus on shorter-term ROI and tight budgets resulted in elongated client devices replacement cycles and overall sales were flat.  Government activity levels were strong. The credibility and track record of the combined and now fully integrated teams of legacy CDW and Sirius opened doors and led to more seats at the table. Since the first quarter is a seasonally light quarter for both federal and state and local spending, our progress is a bit harder to see. Federal's low-teens growth was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in state and local, and sales were flat to last year. Federal growth was balanced across solutions and transaction\u2019s categories. The team's ability to help civilian agencies achieve their priorities around data management drove strong server and storage performance and contributed to high single-digit growth in solutions. Services increased high-teens and Cloud spend remained strong. Underscoring the value of our diverse end markets, federal posted year-over-year transactions growth, which was driven by client, video and audio, and collaboration. State and local low single-digit growth in solutions reflected the team's success helping customers address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagements. Double-digit Cloud spend was driven by both software and security upgrades. Consistent with the fourth quarter, customers made do with their current client devices, and client device declines continued.  For education, solid higher-Ed growth was more than offset by the year-over-year declines in K-12 and overall sales declined 27%. The Higher-Ed sustained their track record of enabling student success programs used to promote enrollment. These programs, which are focused on improving security, campus connectivity, and delivering enhanced dorm room experiences drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, storage, software, and security. K-12 posted another quarter of excellent solutions performance. Solutions mid-teens increase was driven by networking and data center efforts with substantial double-digit increases in storage, servers, and NetComm. Our ability to wrap services around applications and physical security drove excellent services performance.  The K-12 team's solutions performance was more than offset by a meaningful year-over-year decline in client devices and overall sales declined. Similar to last year, customers placed a lower priority on client devices as schools reach student-to-device ratios near or at parity and continue to digest endpoint investments made over the past several years. Instead, schools were focused on networking and data center needs as well as planning for the next horizon of multi-funding -- multiyear funding opportunities. Opportunities, which, given the expertise that we have in this area will generate even more ways to serve this important customer channel.  Our U.K. and Canadian operations, which we report as other, continued to execute very well in the quarter, delivering consistent profit performance as customers prioritize strategic investments and solutions. Similar to the U.S., top-line growth for both markets experienced the impact of heightened economic uncertainty which especially impacted client device demand. U.K. decreased by mid-single digits in local currency, while Canada decreased by high single digits in local currency. Similar to the U.S., strong gross margins reflected a higher value mix. Now let's take a look at how the end market performance translated into portfolio performance. The economic uncertainty that led to the downshift in our commercial business impacted performance across all three of our portfolio categories: hardware, software, and services.  As a full stack full life cycle provider, the deferral of major hardware projects results in lower attach of services and other solutions. All the components of the deliverables are delayed, pending implementation of the project. Delays in pushbacks and hardware may dampen warranty and security opportunities and focus on in-year ROI often drives compressed deal sizes as many customers elected to favor short-term deals versus multiyear agreements. First quarter portfolio results were adversely impacted by all these cascading factors. U.S. hardware decreased by 21%, a further step down from the fourth quarter. Large commercial customer client device declines had the greatest category impact as corporations work through the impact of slower hiring and layoffs.  NetComm hardware growth was very strong in this quarter and increased across all customer end markets. This strong performance was largely driven by improvements in supply but also reflected better demand than we expected. U.S. services decreased to 2%. Growth was impacted by weakness in services tied to hardware, particularly in warranties.  Momentum in Managed Services growth was solid and professional services continue to grow, though was impacted by the delayed timing of full stack IT integration. U.S. software growth remains strong. Double-digit increases in network management software and storage sand were partially offset by declines in software categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels.  Security remained a key focus area for customers, but results were impacted by the shift in large commercial customers' buying behavior and U.S. security sales declined slightly year-over-year. Significant growth in identity management, privileged access management, intrusion detection, and risk and government was offset by declines in firewall. Our largest category, which is also tied to either refresh of physical assets or expansion of customers' footprint. Overall, security demand remained very strong in small business. Once again, cloud was a meaningful contributor to performance with double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit, led by security, platform, and productivity. Within this period of economic uncertainty and heightened customer caution, our trust and engagement with customers and partners was never stronger, trust and engagement that when coupled with our capabilities and deep expertise, serves us well today and trust and engagement that will serve us well when the temporal shift in demand recovers. Although volumes are down, our ability to help our customers drive outcomes across the five components of our eye care framework, especially cost management right now, continues to drive our customer value. Our ability to drive outcomes and address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum enables us to pivot where our customers need us most.  Any ability that and that -- an ability that reflects the impact of strategic investments we have made to enhance our high relevance and high-growth solutions and services, investments that are exceeding our expectations in both capabilities and performance. Investments like our acquisition of Sirius have maximized our differentiation in the market, provided more and better seats at the table, increased customer stickiness, and contributed to our evolution as a one-stop trusted partner. A partner with the capabilities and expertise that can help customers achieve the outcomes they need from the technology and solutions they can trust. The strategic actions we've taken have not only strengthened our value proposition, they have also fortified our profitability, contributing to our operating profit margin expansion of more than 100-basis points since 2020.  It's our strategy when combined with our flexible business model, execution rigor and financial discipline that enables our ability to profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market, and that leads us to our view for the balance of 2023. The initial 2023 U.S. IT market forecast we shared with you on our February call was for flattish growth. Given our belief that first quarter business conditions will persist through at least the second quarter, we now look for the U.S. IT market to contract at high single-digit rate for the full year.  We continue to target outperformance of the U.S. IT market by 200-basis to 300-basis points. This outlook assumes that we will see a moderate pickup in activity in the back half of the year and anticipates that ongoing economic uncertainty will continue to impact customer behavior. Wildcards include deeper recessionary conditions, heightened credit tightness, and debt ceiling-driven liquidity events. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year.  We are operating in choppy waters right now. We have the strategy, capabilities, and discipline to continue to profitably outgrow the market. And while we have a durable process to manage and align cost to opportunity. Given our expectation for market demand, we have amplified our expense discipline to preserve profitability. A hallmark of CDW is to serve our customers whenever and wherever their needs may be. The outcomes technology delivers haven't diminished, and our customers know that we will be there for them regardless of market conditions. CDW is an all-weather team, always adapting and evolving to lead in the market. We have faced turbulent markets in the past and have leveraged our proven business model, unmatched competitive advantages and deep and trusted relationships to come out stronger. We will do so again.  Let me turn it over to Al now who will provide more detail on the financials and outlook. Al?\nAl Miralles : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail in the first quarter. Move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 7. Consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, down 14.2% on a reported basis and 15.6% on an average daily sales basis. Net sales results came in below expectations relative to our outlook. Transactions declined more than expected and despite greater resiliency and while flat year-over-year, Solutions also came in lower than anticipated. Notwithstanding the lower-than-expected solutions performance, the decline in transactions drove a mix shift that benefited margins. And as we've shift shared before, the impact of mixing into a higher relative percentage of solutions and specifically netted down revenue has a dampening effect on total net sales, but tends to bolster gross margins, all of equal.  Since we are not the primary obligor on these transactions, several important high-value components of our solutions portfolio, including Cloud, Software as a Service, much of security, and partner-delivered services and warranties are recorded on a netted down basis, where gross profit is our revenue. In the first quarter, these netted down revenues, and notably SaaS transactions outgrew our overall net sales and represented 32% of our gross profit compared to 31% in the fourth quarter and prior-year first quarter. This continues to be an important trend in our business. Sequential net sales were down 6.1% versus the fourth quarter on a reported basis and 7.6% on an average daily sales basis. Our outlook anticipated better than normal first quarter seasonality, given the unusually soft demand in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes public would have better than historical sequential growth, which it did. It also assumed our commercial channels, corporate and small business will remain firm and deliver close to historical sequential growth levels, they did not. The disconnect came from a downshift in large commercial customer spend, which had an adverse impact on our results. To dimensionalize the shortfall in net sales relative to our expectations, roughly two third of the amount was driven by large commercial customer activity across both transactional and solutions business. On the supply side, the dollar value of our backlog did not change meaningfully relative to the fourth quarter. And while the backlog and product lead times associated with transactional products are essentially back in line with normal levels, supply chain challenges have persisted in NetComm solutions and the backlog here remains elevated.  We continue to anticipate this remaining backlog will feather out over time as supply conditions ease. So, this has been more drawn out than anticipated. As always, we continue to judiciously manage our working capital to support our customers while ensuring strong economic returns. Our free cash flow performance which we'll discuss shortly is emblematic of this discipline. Our team delivered excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.1 billion, a year-over-year decrease of only 1%, despite a double-digit decline in sales. The gross profit margin was a first quarter record of 21.3%, up 280-basis points versus the prior year period and down only 40-basis points versus the record fourth quarter. The year-over-year expansion in gross profit margin was driven by similar factors as in the fourth quarter.  First, product margins benefited both mix into the complex, hybrid cloud solutions and a lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back index transactional products we expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, as we expected for the first quarter a greater mix in the netted down revenues. The category outpaced overall net sales growing low single digits in Q1 compared to Q1 in the prior year, primarily driven by double-digit Software as a Service growth; and third, net sales contribution from high-margin services mix with significant contribution from our recent acquisitions. Turning to SG&A on Slide 8. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $655 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher fixed payroll as our coworker count increased during last year. This was partially offset by a decline in sales payroll expense, reflecting the variable component of our compensation structure, which is principally tied to gross profit attainment. We expect the impact of the higher year-over-year fixed cost SG&A to diminish as we move through the year. To that end, we are focused on our efforts to innovate our operating model and drive productivity and savings. Given the demand environment, we've advanced initiatives to ensure our cost structure is aligned to our opportunity set. This includes driving structural savings as well as pacing our overall coworker count with the level of business demand and in the areas where we can provide the most value to our customers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was approximately 15,300 up slightly from the fourth quarter principally due to the most recent acquisition, which added to our technical resources in professional and managed services. Strategic investments in our solutions and services capabilities remain key to our three-part strategy for growth, an important catalyst for the achievement of our profitability and margin goals. GAAP operating income was $355 million, down $32 million compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $434 million, down $28 million versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income margin was strong at 8.5%, up 70-basis points from the prior year, although down 110-basis points compared to the record fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter, this year-over-year improvement was driven by our strong gross margin. The sequential decline reflected a higher ratio of fixed costs as a result of the lower volume of net sales and gross profit.  Moving to Slide 9. Interest expense was $58 million modestly above the prior year, driven by higher interest rates, but relatively in line with our expectation for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 10 was 22.3%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $66 million. Together non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.7%, within our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5%. As you can see on Slide 12, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.68. Our non-GAAP net income was $279 million in the quarter, down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.03, down 7.9%.  Moving ahead to Slide 13, period-end Cash and cash equivalents were $279 million and net debt was $5.5 billion. During the quarter, we reduced our overall debt by almost $130 million, consistent with our plan to maintain our net leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.3 billion.  Moving to Slide 14. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down three days from the fourth quarter, two days from the prior year first quarter, and within our targeted range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $411 million, as shown on Slide 15. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 and capital allocation objectives, including returning $80 million to shareholders through dividends and $200 million in share repurchases in addition to the $130 million in debt repayment. We also closed the acquisition of Locus recruiting in February.  That brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 16. Our execution remained consistent with the updated objectives we communicated last quarter. First, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. This increase demonstrated our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business. Going forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the first quarter at 2.6 times, flat to the end of the fourth quarter and within our new range of 2 times to 3 times.  We continue to convert business performance into cash generation and have a rigorous process in place to maintain our flexibility and proactively manage liquidity. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities is M&A and share repurchase have remained important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we'll continue to target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned roughly 68%. As a reminder, the Board authorized a $750 million increase to the company's share repurchase program last quarter on top of the remaining dollars from the prior authorization.  Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 17. The current overall IT market sentiment reflects the caution and prudence of customers. We expect this to continue in the near term with a modest recovery of demand conditions in the second half of the year. This informs our expectation that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. With this scenario as our baseline, we look for netted down revenues to continue to grow faster than our other product and solution categories. And we maintain our long-held expectation to outgrow the market by 200-basis to 300-basis points. Keeping in mind that in times of hardware softness, our overperformance tends to be on the lower end of this range and vice versa.  We continue to expect a neutral currency impact for the full year, with modest headwinds in the first half and modest tailwinds in the second half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be within the range of 9%. This reflects the expectation of lower net sales and gross profit, balanced with higher gross margins and a reduction in the level of our fixed expenses.  Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings to decline low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. Related to average daily sales, we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. That equates to a low double-digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline from the second quarter. We anticipate continued strong margin performance in the second quarter with a gross profit margin consistent with levels in Q1 and NGOI margin higher as expense efforts improve operating leverage. And we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to decline mid-single digits year-over-year. In 2023, we expect full-year free cash flow to be at the high end of our new rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales as we continue to emphasize a return on working capital. While we are clearly operating in a cautious and uncertain environment, given our resilient business model, the rigor of our financial controls, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the profitability margin and cash flow, our stakeholders have come to expect. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls.  And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani : Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe to start with, Chris, one the concerns I think folks have had is how much of the issues that you saw in the March quarter are macro versus micro really CDW-specific and I think all the reasons you really mentioned sounds like it's a much more broader trend rather than CDW's success, but I'd love to hear, do you think there's any company specific that may have impacted or magnified these issues. And then any change in trends you're seeing for the month of April so far versus what you saw in March?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Good morning, Amit. Well, let me just take you through and unpack it a little bit. look, the key driver, the overwhelming driver of the performance miss to our expectation was the sharp uptick in concern and caution that we saw with our commercial customers as economic uncertainty intensified through the quarter and the meaningful downshift in customer demand, particularly amongst our large commercial customers as a result. And that translated into an outsized impact on results given the relative size of our commercial business. If I dig a little deeper, look, when our customers got cautious and exhibited a lot of concern, they went into decisions around deferring and pausing and reducing costs generally, which is a playbook for larger customers. And that brought greater scrutiny to projects that brought a focus on shorter-term ROI that brought a focus on overarching cost reductions, all of which created longer sales cycles and shorter duration contracts. I would say we didn't see cancellations, what we saw were delays in smaller deals and the knock-on effects of that. So as a full stack, full life cycle provider, there's a cascading impact across hardware, software, and services. right? So, if you've got large delays in deals, then you have less attach of services and other solutions at that point in time. And when you think about commercial representing more than 50% of our business, the impact just created a major headwind for our top line sales.  Now I would say as you go through the rest of the portfolio, the balanced portfolio of customer end markets did help. But particularly given the extreme softness in the client device market, generally, it didn't help as much as we would have liked. So, when you think about government high Ed and health care, they all performed well but did have some growth challenges, again, due to client international executed well, K-12 executed well in solutions, but they certainly had continuing year-over-year pressures and didn't quite perform in the client area as well as we thought they might.  And so, as a result, the top line was impacted. The other thing I would just unpack for you a little bit is if you go through the portfolio itself, NetComm was strong across the board. Software was strong across the board. Cloud growth remains strong. Services in the areas where we focus strategically, professional, and managed services were strong and solid. We had a little -- we had some impact on services relative to warranties that were softer. But up and down and across the portfolio, we felt very good about execution is really, in our view, is a macro impact. And look -- and you look in terms of profit, contrary to Q4, record first quarter margins weren't enough to offset the magnitude of the shortfall but we did have record first quarter margins and excellent free cash flow. So, I would say that the team is performing well in a really challenging environment. And our cash flow and margins are really demonstrating that the strategy is working as our investments are contributing to enhanced profitability. The other thing I'd say on it, and you've seen this over the years is in periods of uncertainty, we further strengthen the trust and engagement with our customers. We've been through turbulent times before, and these are the times when our customers turn to us and our partners turn to us to address their challenges. And they know we're there for them, regardless of the conditions in the market, and they know that when the temporal shift in demand lifts, we'll be there for them.\nAmit Daryanani : Fair enough. And Chris, can I just follow up on that last part which you were talking about. I think historically, what I mean you see as you come out of these positives or recession or whatever happens in the next six months, you tend to see an inflection of share gains going higher for CDW. So, I'm wondering, I guess, maybe you could touch on what do you think the duration of this path could look like? And do you think you're well positioned to see an acceleration in share gain as you come out of it, given the engagement you have with your customers?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Amit, I would say, in these times, you can imagine what we're doing, controlling what we can control, staying in front of our customers, playing aggressive offense, and really doubling down on the relationship. And that always bodes us well. We like to say accelerating out of the curve is what we do, and that's what we would expect. In terms of the timing, look, hard for any of us, I think, to predict the timing of client devices significantly turning around, for example. But we do feel absolutely confident that as demand shifts that we will be very well positioned to capture more than our fair share of the uplift.\nAmit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Amit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the color today in your prepared remarks. I was just wondering, just starting off with the 2Q guide here for a mid-single-digit sales growth expectation -- now I understand that's not as robust as what you used to see pre-pandemic. But in terms of what's driving the confidence of sort of guiding to a growth into 2Q? And should we expect sort of that growth to continue to and 4Q?  Is that sort of how you're thinking about customer activity starting to sort of return and spending start to improve? And just sort of what's baked into the second half, particularly in terms of your client device expectations? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Yes. Good morning, Samik, this is Al. So, with respect to Q2, I think what you're seeing from our outlook is, again, both expectation that the overall conditions and customer buying behavior would be similar and particularly in commercial that is softer with an offset that, we'd expect that regular seasonality, particularly from our public business. would be in play. So, the lift there largely from that seasonality from public with a bit of a muting from our typical seasonality given the softer conditions otherwise. Now with respect to your question on the second half, so the second half, similar, we would expect we'd have our normal seasonality, including our government business and public having higher seasonality in Q3. And while obviously, we've got extreme conditions we've seen the last couple of quarters, we would anticipate at this point, a pickup in activity. Now that pickup in activity will say kind of balance between clients and solutions. And it's a little bit of a TBD exactly when you'd see client pick up, but there's a reason to believe that we'd see some of that activity in the back half of the year.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And my follow-up, just maybe if we can -- if I can ask you to double click on the NetComm product momentum or the momentum in -- within your portfolio seems to be an outlier related to what you're seeing otherwise in the other parts of the portfolio. Any color on what's driving your customers to still continue to spend on NetComm. Obviously, it's not been -- it's been supply challenge, but not really demand challenge even for the last couple of years. So, what's driving that momentum there still?\nChris Leahy: Samik, it's Chris. And I'd say a couple of things driving the NetComm momentum. One is network momentum. One is supply chain. Obviously, we've got some relief in the backlog, which has been good. But we are seeing demand and when you think about our customers modernizing their infrastructure and the cloud performance that you're seeing, we do have customers who are moving to the cloud, using networking to handle larger and heavier workloads.  We do see customers like our K-12, I mentioned earlier. They're hard at work on classroom upgrades and modernization. When you also think about the trend towards back to the office and in the commercial space, notwithstanding the fact that these large corporate customers are in cost reduction mode.  They are focusing on digital transformation and experiences of their own coworkers and their employees and networking is a very important part of that, obviously, as the data center and networking drive the connectivity out to the employees and to the customers. So, it's not surprising given the amount of client investment that's been made over the past few years, usually ingesting client devices actually requires upgrading networking, and that's what we're seeing.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse. Shannon your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you, very much and good morning. I'm wondering what your customers are saying about artificial intelligence. And I think you have a pretty unique position, I guess, in terms of your, our diverse customer base and ability to talk to them. And I'm just wondering where are they at in their AI journey? Where are they thinking that they're going to be investing as they look to AI? Anything you can give us would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes, Shannon, it's a great question. You're right. There's nobody who's not talking about it. And everybody is talking about it a lot. The good news for CDW is right now, it's moving fast, and it's complex. And there are a lot of work to be done around how the kind of new form of AI can support customers. So, what our customers are saying is frankly, they're saying our CEO says we really need to be all over this. And I say that because there's pressure on the system, which means -- which is always good for CDW because the conversations that we're having around AI and general AI are right now. We're at the front of the design with our customers.  And here's how we think about it. Obviously, we think about it internally for CDW, but as importantly, for our customers. So, A we've always helped our customers unlock the potential of technology to meet whatever the needs are for their current and future business, okay? When we think about AI and what we offer our customers, it fits really nicely into the full stack full life cycle, full outcome approach. And what we're trying to do with customers is they're thinking about what the use cases could be going forward. Those are things, as, like workflows to build innovative products or improving efficiencies in the case in their existing workflows, things that we've all been talking about. What do they need from CDW and how can we help them. A it's identifying those use cases and building them out and supporting them up and down the stack, think professional services, right? Think applications and building B2B applications, think computing and data infrastructure need a whole new kind of infrastructure to support what AI is driving and think models and tooling.  So, our digital velocity team that practice actually already orchestrates AI initiatives with many customers today, and they're having deeper conversations. But I would just say, look, we're at the forefront of this. There is a lot to be worked out. But it is definitely one of those trends that is -- the hype is real in this case. There is going to be a fast and growing market that AI is going to drive, and it fits really nicely within our full stack solution. And so, we're having lots of conversations with customers. And we're doing the same internally. Look, we're looking at all the ways that we can use the new AI to basically drive efficiency within our organization.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you. And then just -- you're at the high end of cash flow for the year. We're about two years, while not quite, but years past the Sirius acquisition. So, what are your current thoughts on acquisitions, what do you see in the landscape like? Are prices coming down or valuations coming down at this point? Or are people still thinking over or a couple of years back and valuations are high?\nChris Leahy: It's really interesting because I would say valuations have not ticked down significantly. Although the pipeline and the outreach has increased. So that tells you something what the landscape might look like three to four months from now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Erik your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Thank you, so much. Good morning, guys. Chris, maybe I'll ask you a question. I appreciate all the color you provided by end market and product. And clearly, there's a lot of moving pieces. I guess if we step back and think about your product exposure and think about what you reported relative to how you guided in February. Can you just understand which products are kind of most responsible for the guide down or maybe for the miss in 1Q and then for the guide down for the rest of 2023? Just trying to understand kind of what is incrementally weaker as we moved through March and into April? And how -- which products are impacting that guide the most? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Yes, sure. Good morning, Erik. Well, let me start with the client device -- let me just start with hardware and client devices because that really was the core of the impact. And again, primarily are the largest impact came from our larger commercial customers. So, number one, on the client side, we continue to see, the market generally has got kind of an extreme -- is an extreme softness right now and that continues. Okay. So that had an impact. And we saw in the client space moderating either -- even further down as we progress throughout the quarter. And you continue to see staff reductions across every industry. And those things are impacting client device purchases.  And I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the large commercial customers client device category was the biggest down shift in the corporate space. So, client device is number one. Server storage, hardware, things that are customers are looking at, and finding ways to save money. That's another source of the down shift. And what happens when you've got hardware either being refreshed not refreshed delayed or paused if you have a knock-on effect. It's like a cascading effect. So, if projects are delayed, the services that go with the project obviously aren't implemented some of them until the integration of the product. You also have things like warranty that are going to be a bigger impact to warranty when you're not buying hardware. So, if I come back to the categories, I'd say it all starts with large customers reducing their costs immediately, which means let's reduce hardware, let's extend the useful life of assets. When we're purchasing software, for example, we can purchase a one-year deal instead of a three-year deal. They're pausing on making decisions on things because they don't want to get locked in. But it does start with the areas of hardware. And then where we saw softness in places that I would say are very strategic for us, that really was, again, an effect of the delay or deferral of larger projects. I would say, overall, look, our services business is very strong in the areas that are strategic. If you take out warranties, professional services, managed services, strong, yet impacted security, strong in the areas that we've been investing heavily in weaker in firewalls, which are related primarily to the, when you're buying physical assets or extending your geographic footprint.  And then cloud. I mean cloud is continuing to be extremely robust across every one of our customer segments. So, I'm trying to dig into the weeds a little bit here for you, and I hope I'm getting to the heart of your question. but it's starting with the climate. I mean that's really what happened, starting with the climate and climate of cost containment.\nErik Woodring: No, that was exactly what I was looking for. And then maybe my follow-up. We've gotten a lot of questions about CDW's definition of U.S. IT market growth versus how other companies might portray it. And Obviously, there is an impact of netted down revenue mix that it would be helpful to maybe understand. But said differently, if U.S. IT market growth in CDW is down high single digit year-over-year, how would you think about your overall customer spending to trend in 2023? I think that would be helpful just again, because there is an impact of this netted down revenue that dampens the view of your U.S. IT market growth. So, I just want to unpackage that, please. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Yes, Eric, let me take that. This is Al. So just a couple of things. You're definitely right with respect to netted down revenues and the impact from that. The other component is obviously you have a mix component. If you think about the broader IT market relative to our mix, there is a translation, if you will. I think most notably, in normalized years that does not create significant distortion in a year like this where the mix has shifted significantly. That is client coming down considerably and more solutions and netted down revenues being up. It does create more exaggerated results.  So, what I would tell you is if you think about our full year guide with respect to the IT market, it is high single digits decline, if we think about that on a gross spend basis, Obviously, that would be more muted than that decline. Does that help you?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks, good morning. Al, I hate to be the one to question guidance again, but it's a question that we're getting a lot here this morning. Q2 is obviously very clear, so I appreciate all the details, but more on the shape of the back half of this year embedded in your guidance? And if I look last year, you guided Q3 to low single-digit sequential growth. And if I applied that here, it would imply a really big hockey stick in Q4. Conversely, if Q3 was above that level, it's implying a bigger Fed quarter, but we've got debt ceiling concerns causing a potential Fed slowdown in that quarter. So, a little bit of a double-edged sword. And just wondering if there's any way we could be thinking about waiting in the back half because there's a fear that this might not be the last cut.\nAl Miralles: Yes. Sure, Adam. Happy to address that. So, on the back half, first of all, let me just say the, our expectation that Q2 would look a lot like Q1 obviously informs then the seasonality for the rest of the year, right, because we would apply our typical seasonality. Q3 definitely reflects, I'll call it, reasonably normal public seasonality.  And so, you have that in play. Look, the comps, frankly, for Q3 are much tougher than Q4. Q4 was really the first time that we felt the effect of softening and particularly in client. And so, I think Q3 probably looks a little bit more normalized from a seasonality perspective. And then Q4, I'll call it more of the pickup there, particularly given the lower comps that we saw there with education and with client.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, Chris, I'll ask a higher level one. You often talked about the CDW story and culture as a differentiator, in particular, for the company. leads to your ability to outperform the IT market consistently and profitably. Here most recently, you have made a tough decision to reduce coworker count. So, I'm just wondering how you thought about that decision to implement layoffs essentially in efforts that you made to try and preserve culture. And Al, if you wanted to maybe talk more quantitatively about how you're able to maintain expectations to outperform the market by 200-basis to 300-basis points while reducing workforce with your sales productivity expectations look like post that would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes, Adam, it's a great question as well. And as you can imagine, we approached a decision like that with great care and respect. And I'll tell you, look, we have been -- we are operating discipline -- cost discipline is something that is evergreen. We are always focused on finding productivity and efficiencies. It's just how we operate. as we've been in a cautious environment, we've been very prudent and I think proactive in calling our costs and calibrating to the environment. which, as we've mentioned in Q1, really, we got a pickup in intensity of the economic uncertainty. And so, we went into high gear in terms of our prudence. And what we've done is really pull every lever we can pull to align our current cost structure with the demand that we're seeing. And when I say every lever, I mean all the things you would imagine, discretionary spend, hiring, promotion, staffing, geographic locations, et cetera. And one of the decisions we had to make was to adjust our staffing to current demand environment. Now look, these are really hard decisions. I'm proud of the team and how they put it together and how we communicated it. And everybody was very respectful. Now all that said, the teams have -- are looking forward because that's what the organization needs to do. We're pivoting to the future. and focused really heavily on our customers. But you're right, it was a tough decision but the right decision for the business and for the customers ultimately.\nAl Miralles: Adam, I'll just add a couple of comments to your questions on productivity and hitting on our goals, if you will. So, to Chris' point, look, this was not a reaction. We had been pacing our hiring and our coworker count and our discretionary spend in the quarter is building up. Obviously, we saw a sharp turn in Q1, and we expect some of that to persist.  We had structural efforts, activities in place to drive productivity and savings, and we basically just amplified those efforts. So, let me just parse it for you when we think about kind of allocation of our coworkers, first from a revenue-producing GP and going through something like this, we're looking at where are the areas and the practice areas that the demand vectors are stronger and we should allocate more resources and where areas where maybe that demand could be softer for a more prolonged period. And so that was part of the calculus in going through that. And then when we think about kind of more of the support layer and the infrastructure, again, we got structural initiatives, but we also expect that we're going to drive productivity, coworker savings from that. And so, there are all the things that went into this decision and these actions. And we believe while difficult, obviously, to go through, ultimately, we'll add the greatest value for our customers. and obviously, improve efficiency.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Matt your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you, and good morning. I have a question on your cloud-related revenue, which continues to be strong. there are some concerns that large customers are now digesting their cloud investments and looking to optimize those investments. Are you seeing any signs of that? Or do you expect continued strength as customers elect to move workloads off-prem instead of refreshing their own data centers?\nChris Leahy: Matt, it's Chris. I'd say both actually. We're seeing large customers who are optimizing for sure, particularly in this environment of cost optimization and reduction opportunity for CDW with our professional services and our FINOP services and things that we can offer to our customers to help them do exactly that and then potentially convert that into managed services going forward. But equally, we are seeing organizations that are kind of optimizing their cloud environment, not just workloads on the cloud, but the cloud environment and continuing to make decisions about where workloads are best optimized, whether it's on-prem whether it's -- now we're moving towards private on-prem, but where that should sit in multi-cloud public arena as well, so moving workloads potentially from one public cloud to another public cloud, again, for optimizing either for performance, functionality, costs, et cetera.  All of this requires health from CDW to design the movements to actually do the migrations. And as I said, ultimately, we're seeing more and more opportunity to convert some of this into managed services, cloud managed services, which, of course, is a is a positive thing for us and for our customers.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thanks for that. And I had a question regarding your comments on maintenance contracts, which I -- which appears to be weak. In my past experience with CDW in down cycles, you've actually seen an increase in maintenance contracts and renewals as customers look to so-called sweat your assets longer. What's different this time? Or am I missing something?\nChris Leahy: No, no, you're not. It's a great question. We asked the question earlier. What's different? What's different is we do see when folks are sweating assets, they are extending warranties typically, they're extending them for short periods. So, at a time when you would typically see a hardware renewal with a three-year contract, for example, warranties are coming in at shorter time periods. We also have some folks who are making the decision not to extend warranties. So, we're just seeing softening across the board there. And what we don't have is the offset of hardware purchases elsewhere, software purchases elsewhere, we're seeing new warranties come into play. So, it's a bit of a while you'd expect warranties to have an uptick because people are -- our customers are extending the useful life of their assets. The size of those warranties, the deals are smaller so it's muting the impact of the top line.\nAl Miralles: And Matt, maybe just let me add just a couple of comments. Number one is just recall that warranty business shows up as netted down revenues. For us, the recognition is upfront. And so therefore, if we have a typical four-year warranty, that turns into a one year, obviously, the recognition and the result for us obviously becomes muted. The other element I would just add here and look, maybe somewhat obvious is just the -- some of this focus on shorter ROI and the financial impacts therein are creating more conversations that will come back around with customers. That is the -- there's a sweating assets, but an expectation that, that business will come back around, both in terms of refreshing some of the infrastructure and some of the clients, but as well as, in some cases, renewals of software assurance software and warranties that we're seeing in a little bit shorter duration here.\nChris Leahy: And I would just add to what Al said, I think it's an important point. The delays, the pauses, the deferrals that we're seeing is really just that. We haven't seen the cancellation. So, all of this really reflects itself in pipeline in the future. And so that's a positive sign.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: I know we're running late, always get the one in here. I know client devices have been very important for you guys. And as you look out going forward, I think it was as early as last quarter, you guys were talking about perhaps a return of client devices. I'm assuming that thought process has changed a little bit. And as you think about client devices, in particular, is there a period for which you can no longer sweat these assets? Is it a few quarters it goes out to a few years? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Good morning, Keith, it's Chris. I think I understood your question was around kind of when assets have to be replaced? Was that the question? I just want to make sure I was getting the question right.\nKeith Housum: Yes. I think PCs have been under -- particularly have been under pressure and the thought process was that in the second half of the year, you might see some recovery. I'm assuming one that's not the same assumption anymore. And then two, like PCs or client devices, when they are sweated. Is there a period of time that you can no longer sweat them forward and you really have to make the investment regardless?\nChris Leahy: Yes. Okay. I got the question. It's a good question. I'd say, look, when it comes to PCs, the PC themselves can go foru years, five years. I'd say four, five, 5.5 years. that's not ideal because the feature functionality gets to be very old by that point in time. But if customers are really sweating the assets because they're in a financial situation needs to do so, it can go that long. All that said, if you look back over the last four years to five years, you're going to see a number of PC refresh requirements that are coming up.  And I'd add that you have things like win 11, which is going to add more pressure to those device refreshes. So, we've said this before, we do expect a refresh cycles to be starting sooner rather than later, whether it's federal government when we know when they're buying cycle is, whether it's Chromebooks. I mean, we're seeing a number of large RFPs related to Chromebooks for our education students already. So, our expectation is refreshes are going to be under pressure to begin later in the year into 2024. And when they do, we'll reap the benefit of that.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Ruplu your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Chris, in the past, in a downturn, corporate and small business typically decline first, followed later by government and other public sector channels. Revenues from government and health care looks like in 1Q were slightly up year-on-year. Are you seeing any weakness in those sectors? And are you concerned at all about those end markets? And what have you factored in for the full year for those end markets? And I have a follow-up.\nChris Leahy: Okay. Good morning, Ruplu. In terms of federal and health care, the countercyclicality that you pointed to, we're a bit in the reverse of that, actually. We had some softness in the public space going back a bit. And what we're seeing now is public, federal, in particular, we're seeing strong activity, I'd say, getting back to our normal seasonality and stronger activity as we run into the back half of the year. In fact, their performance this quarter was quite balanced across transactions and solutions. So, we're not seeing any issues there that we're concerned about and expect normal seasonality in the back half of the year. Health care is another one. It's been a pretty good balance across transactions and solutions, a little tougher in the client space but health care is really doing well. Given the increases in costs and wage inflation and everything they're experiencing, they're needing more help on technology and people help as well.  So, we're actually seeing our value proposition with our health care customers accelerate in many ways, and you add our Sirius team into the mix here. And as I said before, it opens doors and gets more seats at the table. Health care is also equally feeling very robust. So, we don't have concerns of either of those end markets going into the end of the year.\nAl Miralles: And maybe Ruplu, just one component I'd add there is just the -- just remember, one of the big drivers always is funding. And we would say, from a funding perspective, both government and education, we're at a reasonable level there. So, we think that there certainly is the impetus and catalyst there for continued spending.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details. Can I just ask, Chris, why is high single digits year-on-year, the correct number for U.S. IT market growth? I mean, why not down double digits or down even mid-single digits. I mean, just if you could give a little bit more color on what you're assuming for data center products like server, storage, networking growth versus PC growth? And how much of the backlog that you have factors into your particular revenue growth of down mid-single digits year-over-year in 2023? Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Let me just maybe Ruplu, start on the backlog. So, backlog, not a meaningful contributor in our expectations I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that NetComm continues to be a sticking point. We would expect that to feather out. It's taken longer, but we would not consider that to be a meaningful contribution for the remainder of the year. So.\nChris Leahy: Yes, Ruplu. I would add -- look, let me just start with how we shape our view of the IT market, and it's substantially grounded in 11,000 customer-facing coworkers who are in market every day. And so there -- they've got the pulse of what's going on in the market and what customers are doing, saying and feeling. And while we have a number of market factors that we look at and analyze that the customer pulse is the most relevant one that we consider.  So, I'd just say that's 1 thing that we are looking at. And then we're factoring in as we think about the year, the caution and concern that we've already mentioned that, that will continue at least in the short run, and we've reflected that in our Q2 outlook. And then expecting some moderation in the back end, some moderating recovery in the back end. So, all of that combined is a reflection of, as I said, what we're seeing in the market, the current activity in terms of written demand, in terms of back order, in terms of all of the things that we triangulate. And frankly, that's just -- that's where we end up. because of what we're seeing because of seasonality. We've already kind of gone through Q2. It's going to feel about the same as Q1, right?  We'll get a little bump in seasonality, but that will be muted as Al mentioned earlier. And when you think about the back half of the year, what we have benefiting us there is seasonality from our government business, for example, and education running into the third quarter. And we also have lower overlaps, compares are easier in the last quarter. So, all of those things combined, you put them together, and that's just -- that's where we end up.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details, appreciated.\nChris Leahy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I'll hand back to the CDW team for any further remarks.\nChris Leahy: All right. Well, thank you very much. Let me close by reemphasizing my confidence in this team in our strategy and the durability of our resilient business model. Thank you to our CDW coworkers across the globe for your unwavering commitment to our customers. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. And Al and I look forward to seeing you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover today. I'll begin with an overview of our results and our outlook, and Al will provide a deeper view into the financials as well as an overview of our capital allocation priorities, and then we'll move right to your questions.  Market conditions were turbulent with a marked down shift in demand as the quarter progressed, translating into lower business volume. For the first quarter, net sales were $5.1 billion, 16% lower than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $434 million, down 6% and non-GAAP net income per share was $2.03, down 8%. While clearly not satisfied with these results, our excellent cash flow and record gross margin reinforce the durability of our underlying profitability and integrity of our strategy. So, let's take a look at what happened in the puts and takes of the quarter. First, what happened? In short, demand was weaker than anticipated in our commercial business. When we exited 2022, our forecast called for a moderate softening of IT demand in 2023 and a mid-single-digit year-over-year decline in first quarter sales. As the quarter progressed, IT demand weakened more than expected as a confluence of events intensified already heightened economic concerns and recession fears.  This led to a fairly rapid shift in customer behavior, most notably in our large commercial customers. Projects that drove cost reduction, productivity, and financial returns were prioritized. Project justification and budget scrutiny ruled the day. And although deals were not canceled, sales cycles elongated, written sales slowed, and deal sizes compressed. While all of this translated into lower sales, the value of the solutions we provided customers continue to grow. You see the impact of this on our gross margin momentum. Margins were consistent with last quarter with meaningful year-over-year expansion in each of our customer end markets.  But unlike the fourth quarter, our strong margins did not fully offset the magnitude of our net sales decline. Let's take a look at the puts and takes of the quarter by customer end market. Recall, we have five sales channels: Corporate, Small Business, Healthcare, Government, and Education, each a meaningful business on its own, with 2022 annual sales ranging from $1.9 billion to over $10 billion. Within each channel, the teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. Our commercial operations are organized around geographies, verticals, and customer size. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.9 billion in 2022 sales.  These unique customer end markets often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each as was the case this quarter. The shift in large commercial customer behavior had an outsized impact on corporate results with sales down 17% year-over-year. Declines were particularly steep in client devices, servers, and storage. Three meaningful hardware categories that require capital outlays, outlays under pressure, and out of favor. The corporate team's success helping customers achieve ongoing network and application modernization led to excellent NetComm performance. up double digits.  Momentum continued around projects focusing on increasing productivity and enhancing customer and coworkers' experiences, which drove strong growth in cloud and software spend. The small business team posted another quarter of solutions growth, driven by success helping customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity, priorities that drove meaningful increases in cloud and software customer spend on pace with recent quarters. Network upgrade activity also drove a high single-digit increase in NetComm with resilience in demand for solutions, the gross margin of the small business channel continued to be accretive to overall margins. Strong solutions performance was more than offset by the ongoing impact of economic uncertainty on transactions and small business net sales declined 23%.  Public sales declined 12%. Performance in government and healthcare held firm as organizations called on CDW to help them extract more value out of their IT footprints while education remained under pressure. Solutions momentum in health care was strong, driven by continued success helping customers adopt technology to drive productivity as an offset to higher costs from rising labor and materials inflation. Cloud performance was excellent, hesitancy over privacy concerns waned and healthcare systems embraced the speed and efficiency that cloud solutions can deliver. Talent needs and data center projects remain focused areas, with customers increasingly using technology to address complex industry challenges. Patient care and patient experience continue to be mission-critical, driving ongoing investment in collaboration solutions. However, similar to our commercial markets greater focus on shorter-term ROI and tight budgets resulted in elongated client devices replacement cycles and overall sales were flat.  Government activity levels were strong. The credibility and track record of the combined and now fully integrated teams of legacy CDW and Sirius opened doors and led to more seats at the table. Since the first quarter is a seasonally light quarter for both federal and state and local spending, our progress is a bit harder to see. Federal's low-teens growth was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in state and local, and sales were flat to last year. Federal growth was balanced across solutions and transaction's categories. The team's ability to help civilian agencies achieve their priorities around data management drove strong server and storage performance and contributed to high single-digit growth in solutions. Services increased high-teens and Cloud spend remained strong. Underscoring the value of our diverse end markets, federal posted year-over-year transactions growth, which was driven by client, video and audio, and collaboration. State and local low single-digit growth in solutions reflected the team's success helping customers address talent gaps through enhanced training as well as professional services engagements. Double-digit Cloud spend was driven by both software and security upgrades. Consistent with the fourth quarter, customers made do with their current client devices, and client device declines continued.  For education, solid higher-Ed growth was more than offset by the year-over-year declines in K-12 and overall sales declined 27%. The Higher-Ed sustained their track record of enabling student success programs used to promote enrollment. These programs, which are focused on improving security, campus connectivity, and delivering enhanced dorm room experiences drove double-digit growth across cloud, NetComm, storage, software, and security. K-12 posted another quarter of excellent solutions performance. Solutions mid-teens increase was driven by networking and data center efforts with substantial double-digit increases in storage, servers, and NetComm. Our ability to wrap services around applications and physical security drove excellent services performance.  The K-12 team's solutions performance was more than offset by a meaningful year-over-year decline in client devices and overall sales declined. Similar to last year, customers placed a lower priority on client devices as schools reach student-to-device ratios near or at parity and continue to digest endpoint investments made over the past several years. Instead, schools were focused on networking and data center needs as well as planning for the next horizon of multi-funding -- multiyear funding opportunities. Opportunities, which, given the expertise that we have in this area will generate even more ways to serve this important customer channel.  Our U.K. and Canadian operations, which we report as other, continued to execute very well in the quarter, delivering consistent profit performance as customers prioritize strategic investments and solutions. Similar to the U.S., top-line growth for both markets experienced the impact of heightened economic uncertainty which especially impacted client device demand. U.K. decreased by mid-single digits in local currency, while Canada decreased by high single digits in local currency. Similar to the U.S., strong gross margins reflected a higher value mix. Now let's take a look at how the end market performance translated into portfolio performance. The economic uncertainty that led to the downshift in our commercial business impacted performance across all three of our portfolio categories: hardware, software, and services.  As a full stack full life cycle provider, the deferral of major hardware projects results in lower attach of services and other solutions. All the components of the deliverables are delayed, pending implementation of the project. Delays in pushbacks and hardware may dampen warranty and security opportunities and focus on in-year ROI often drives compressed deal sizes as many customers elected to favor short-term deals versus multiyear agreements. First quarter portfolio results were adversely impacted by all these cascading factors. U.S. hardware decreased by 21%, a further step down from the fourth quarter. Large commercial customer client device declines had the greatest category impact as corporations work through the impact of slower hiring and layoffs.  NetComm hardware growth was very strong in this quarter and increased across all customer end markets. This strong performance was largely driven by improvements in supply but also reflected better demand than we expected. U.S. services decreased to 2%. Growth was impacted by weakness in services tied to hardware, particularly in warranties.  Momentum in Managed Services growth was solid and professional services continue to grow, though was impacted by the delayed timing of full stack IT integration. U.S. software growth remains strong. Double-digit increases in network management software and storage sand were partially offset by declines in software categories tied to full stack projects and employment levels.  Security remained a key focus area for customers, but results were impacted by the shift in large commercial customers' buying behavior and U.S. security sales declined slightly year-over-year. Significant growth in identity management, privileged access management, intrusion detection, and risk and government was offset by declines in firewall. Our largest category, which is also tied to either refresh of physical assets or expansion of customers' footprint. Overall, security demand remained very strong in small business. Once again, cloud was a meaningful contributor to performance with double-digit increases in customer spend and gross profit, led by security, platform, and productivity. Within this period of economic uncertainty and heightened customer caution, our trust and engagement with customers and partners was never stronger, trust and engagement that when coupled with our capabilities and deep expertise, serves us well today and trust and engagement that will serve us well when the temporal shift in demand recovers. Although volumes are down, our ability to help our customers drive outcomes across the five components of our eye care framework, especially cost management right now, continues to drive our customer value. Our ability to drive outcomes and address customer priorities across the entire IT continuum enables us to pivot where our customers need us most.  Any ability that and that -- an ability that reflects the impact of strategic investments we have made to enhance our high relevance and high-growth solutions and services, investments that are exceeding our expectations in both capabilities and performance. Investments like our acquisition of Sirius have maximized our differentiation in the market, provided more and better seats at the table, increased customer stickiness, and contributed to our evolution as a one-stop trusted partner. A partner with the capabilities and expertise that can help customers achieve the outcomes they need from the technology and solutions they can trust. The strategic actions we've taken have not only strengthened our value proposition, they have also fortified our profitability, contributing to our operating profit margin expansion of more than 100-basis points since 2020.  It's our strategy when combined with our flexible business model, execution rigor and financial discipline that enables our ability to profitably outgrow the U.S. IT market, and that leads us to our view for the balance of 2023. The initial 2023 U.S. IT market forecast we shared with you on our February call was for flattish growth. Given our belief that first quarter business conditions will persist through at least the second quarter, we now look for the U.S. IT market to contract at high single-digit rate for the full year.  We continue to target outperformance of the U.S. IT market by 200-basis to 300-basis points. This outlook assumes that we will see a moderate pickup in activity in the back half of the year and anticipates that ongoing economic uncertainty will continue to impact customer behavior. Wildcards include deeper recessionary conditions, heightened credit tightness, and debt ceiling-driven liquidity events. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions and refine our view of the market as we move through the year.  We are operating in choppy waters right now. We have the strategy, capabilities, and discipline to continue to profitably outgrow the market. And while we have a durable process to manage and align cost to opportunity. Given our expectation for market demand, we have amplified our expense discipline to preserve profitability. A hallmark of CDW is to serve our customers whenever and wherever their needs may be. The outcomes technology delivers haven't diminished, and our customers know that we will be there for them regardless of market conditions. CDW is an all-weather team, always adapting and evolving to lead in the market. We have faced turbulent markets in the past and have leveraged our proven business model, unmatched competitive advantages and deep and trusted relationships to come out stronger. We will do so again.  Let me turn it over to Al now who will provide more detail on the financials and outlook. Al? Yes. Good morning, Amit. Well, let me just take you through and unpack it a little bit. look, the key driver, the overwhelming driver of the performance miss to our expectation was the sharp uptick in concern and caution that we saw with our commercial customers as economic uncertainty intensified through the quarter and the meaningful downshift in customer demand, particularly amongst our large commercial customers as a result. And that translated into an outsized impact on results given the relative size of our commercial business. If I dig a little deeper, look, when our customers got cautious and exhibited a lot of concern, they went into decisions around deferring and pausing and reducing costs generally, which is a playbook for larger customers. And that brought greater scrutiny to projects that brought a focus on shorter-term ROI that brought a focus on overarching cost reductions, all of which created longer sales cycles and shorter duration contracts. I would say we didn't see cancellations, what we saw were delays in smaller deals and the knock-on effects of that. So as a full stack, full life cycle provider, there's a cascading impact across hardware, software, and services. right? So, if you've got large delays in deals, then you have less attach of services and other solutions at that point in time. And when you think about commercial representing more than 50% of our business, the impact just created a major headwind for our top line sales.  Now I would say as you go through the rest of the portfolio, the balanced portfolio of customer end markets did help. But particularly given the extreme softness in the client device market, generally, it didn't help as much as we would have liked. So, when you think about government high Ed and health care, they all performed well but did have some growth challenges, again, due to client international executed well, K-12 executed well in solutions, but they certainly had continuing year-over-year pressures and didn't quite perform in the client area as well as we thought they might.  And so, as a result, the top line was impacted. The other thing I would just unpack for you a little bit is if you go through the portfolio itself, NetComm was strong across the board. Software was strong across the board. Cloud growth remains strong. Services in the areas where we focus strategically, professional, and managed services were strong and solid. We had a little -- we had some impact on services relative to warranties that were softer. But up and down and across the portfolio, we felt very good about execution is really, in our view, is a macro impact. And look -- and you look in terms of profit, contrary to Q4, record first quarter margins weren't enough to offset the magnitude of the shortfall but we did have record first quarter margins and excellent free cash flow. So, I would say that the team is performing well in a really challenging environment. And our cash flow and margins are really demonstrating that the strategy is working as our investments are contributing to enhanced profitability. The other thing I'd say on it, and you've seen this over the years is in periods of uncertainty, we further strengthen the trust and engagement with our customers. We've been through turbulent times before, and these are the times when our customers turn to us and our partners turn to us to address their challenges. And they know we're there for them, regardless of the conditions in the market, and they know that when the temporal shift in demand lifts, we'll be there for them. Yes. Amit, I would say, in these times, you can imagine what we're doing, controlling what we can control, staying in front of our customers, playing aggressive offense, and really doubling down on the relationship. And that always bodes us well. We like to say accelerating out of the curve is what we do, and that's what we would expect. In terms of the timing, look, hard for any of us, I think, to predict the timing of client devices significantly turning around, for example. But we do feel absolutely confident that as demand shifts that we will be very well positioned to capture more than our fair share of the uplift. Thank you, Amit. Samik, it's Chris. And I'd say a couple of things driving the NetComm momentum. One is network momentum. One is supply chain. Obviously, we've got some relief in the backlog, which has been good. But we are seeing demand and when you think about our customers modernizing their infrastructure and the cloud performance that you're seeing, we do have customers who are moving to the cloud, using networking to handle larger and heavier workloads.  We do see customers like our K-12, I mentioned earlier. They're hard at work on classroom upgrades and modernization. When you also think about the trend towards back to the office and in the commercial space, notwithstanding the fact that these large corporate customers are in cost reduction mode.  They are focusing on digital transformation and experiences of their own coworkers and their employees and networking is a very important part of that, obviously, as the data center and networking drive the connectivity out to the employees and to the customers. So, it's not surprising given the amount of client investment that's been made over the past few years, usually ingesting client devices actually requires upgrading networking, and that's what we're seeing. Yes, Shannon, it's a great question. You're right. There's nobody who's not talking about it. And everybody is talking about it a lot. The good news for CDW is right now, it's moving fast, and it's complex. And there are a lot of work to be done around how the kind of new form of AI can support customers. So, what our customers are saying is frankly, they're saying our CEO says we really need to be all over this. And I say that because there's pressure on the system, which means -- which is always good for CDW because the conversations that we're having around AI and general AI are right now. We're at the front of the design with our customers.  And here's how we think about it. Obviously, we think about it internally for CDW, but as importantly, for our customers. So, A we've always helped our customers unlock the potential of technology to meet whatever the needs are for their current and future business, okay? When we think about AI and what we offer our customers, it fits really nicely into the full stack full life cycle, full outcome approach. And what we're trying to do with customers is they're thinking about what the use cases could be going forward. Those are things, as, like workflows to build innovative products or improving efficiencies in the case in their existing workflows, things that we've all been talking about. What do they need from CDW and how can we help them. A it's identifying those use cases and building them out and supporting them up and down the stack, think professional services, right? Think applications and building B2B applications, think computing and data infrastructure need a whole new kind of infrastructure to support what AI is driving and think models and tooling.  So, our digital velocity team that practice actually already orchestrates AI initiatives with many customers today, and they're having deeper conversations. But I would just say, look, we're at the forefront of this. There is a lot to be worked out. But it is definitely one of those trends that is -- the hype is real in this case. There is going to be a fast and growing market that AI is going to drive, and it fits really nicely within our full stack solution. And so, we're having lots of conversations with customers. And we're doing the same internally. Look, we're looking at all the ways that we can use the new AI to basically drive efficiency within our organization. It's really interesting because I would say valuations have not ticked down significantly. Although the pipeline and the outreach has increased. So that tells you something what the landscape might look like three to four months from now. Yes, sure. Good morning, Erik. Well, let me start with the client device -- let me just start with hardware and client devices because that really was the core of the impact. And again, primarily are the largest impact came from our larger commercial customers. So, number one, on the client side, we continue to see, the market generally has got kind of an extreme -- is an extreme softness right now and that continues. Okay. So that had an impact. And we saw in the client space moderating either -- even further down as we progress throughout the quarter. And you continue to see staff reductions across every industry. And those things are impacting client device purchases.  And I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the large commercial customers client device category was the biggest down shift in the corporate space. So, client device is number one. Server storage, hardware, things that are customers are looking at, and finding ways to save money. That's another source of the down shift. And what happens when you've got hardware either being refreshed not refreshed delayed or paused if you have a knock-on effect. It's like a cascading effect. So, if projects are delayed, the services that go with the project obviously aren't implemented some of them until the integration of the product. You also have things like warranty that are going to be a bigger impact to warranty when you're not buying hardware. So, if I come back to the categories, I'd say it all starts with large customers reducing their costs immediately, which means let's reduce hardware, let's extend the useful life of assets. When we're purchasing software, for example, we can purchase a one-year deal instead of a three-year deal. They're pausing on making decisions on things because they don't want to get locked in. But it does start with the areas of hardware. And then where we saw softness in places that I would say are very strategic for us, that really was, again, an effect of the delay or deferral of larger projects. I would say, overall, look, our services business is very strong in the areas that are strategic. If you take out warranties, professional services, managed services, strong, yet impacted security, strong in the areas that we've been investing heavily in weaker in firewalls, which are related primarily to the, when you're buying physical assets or extending your geographic footprint.  And then cloud. I mean cloud is continuing to be extremely robust across every one of our customer segments. So, I'm trying to dig into the weeds a little bit here for you, and I hope I'm getting to the heart of your question. but it's starting with the climate. I mean that's really what happened, starting with the climate and climate of cost containment. Yes, Adam, it's a great question as well. And as you can imagine, we approached a decision like that with great care and respect. And I'll tell you, look, we have been -- we are operating discipline -- cost discipline is something that is evergreen. We are always focused on finding productivity and efficiencies. It's just how we operate. as we've been in a cautious environment, we've been very prudent and I think proactive in calling our costs and calibrating to the environment. which, as we've mentioned in Q1, really, we got a pickup in intensity of the economic uncertainty. And so, we went into high gear in terms of our prudence. And what we've done is really pull every lever we can pull to align our current cost structure with the demand that we're seeing. And when I say every lever, I mean all the things you would imagine, discretionary spend, hiring, promotion, staffing, geographic locations, et cetera. And one of the decisions we had to make was to adjust our staffing to current demand environment. Now look, these are really hard decisions. I'm proud of the team and how they put it together and how we communicated it. And everybody was very respectful. Now all that said, the teams have -- are looking forward because that's what the organization needs to do. We're pivoting to the future. and focused really heavily on our customers. But you're right, it was a tough decision but the right decision for the business and for the customers ultimately. Matt, it's Chris. I'd say both actually. We're seeing large customers who are optimizing for sure, particularly in this environment of cost optimization and reduction opportunity for CDW with our professional services and our FINOP services and things that we can offer to our customers to help them do exactly that and then potentially convert that into managed services going forward. But equally, we are seeing organizations that are kind of optimizing their cloud environment, not just workloads on the cloud, but the cloud environment and continuing to make decisions about where workloads are best optimized, whether it's on-prem whether it's -- now we're moving towards private on-prem, but where that should sit in multi-cloud public arena as well, so moving workloads potentially from one public cloud to another public cloud, again, for optimizing either for performance, functionality, costs, et cetera.  All of this requires health from CDW to design the movements to actually do the migrations. And as I said, ultimately, we're seeing more and more opportunity to convert some of this into managed services, cloud managed services, which, of course, is a is a positive thing for us and for our customers. No, no, you're not. It's a great question. We asked the question earlier. What's different? What's different is we do see when folks are sweating assets, they are extending warranties typically, they're extending them for short periods. So, at a time when you would typically see a hardware renewal with a three-year contract, for example, warranties are coming in at shorter time periods. We also have some folks who are making the decision not to extend warranties. So, we're just seeing softening across the board there. And what we don't have is the offset of hardware purchases elsewhere, software purchases elsewhere, we're seeing new warranties come into play. So, it's a bit of a while you'd expect warranties to have an uptick because people are -- our customers are extending the useful life of their assets. The size of those warranties, the deals are smaller so it's muting the impact of the top line. And I would just add to what Al said, I think it's an important point. The delays, the pauses, the deferrals that we're seeing is really just that. We haven't seen the cancellation. So, all of this really reflects itself in pipeline in the future. And so that's a positive sign. Good morning, Keith, it's Chris. I think I understood your question was around kind of when assets have to be replaced? Was that the question? I just want to make sure I was getting the question right. Yes. Okay. I got the question. It's a good question. I'd say, look, when it comes to PCs, the PC themselves can go foru years, five years. I'd say four, five, 5.5 years. that's not ideal because the feature functionality gets to be very old by that point in time. But if customers are really sweating the assets because they're in a financial situation needs to do so, it can go that long. All that said, if you look back over the last four years to five years, you're going to see a number of PC refresh requirements that are coming up.  And I'd add that you have things like win 11, which is going to add more pressure to those device refreshes. So, we've said this before, we do expect a refresh cycles to be starting sooner rather than later, whether it's federal government when we know when they're buying cycle is, whether it's Chromebooks. I mean, we're seeing a number of large RFPs related to Chromebooks for our education students already. So, our expectation is refreshes are going to be under pressure to begin later in the year into 2024. And when they do, we'll reap the benefit of that. Okay. Good morning, Ruplu. In terms of federal and health care, the countercyclicality that you pointed to, we're a bit in the reverse of that, actually. We had some softness in the public space going back a bit. And what we're seeing now is public, federal, in particular, we're seeing strong activity, I'd say, getting back to our normal seasonality and stronger activity as we run into the back half of the year. In fact, their performance this quarter was quite balanced across transactions and solutions. So, we're not seeing any issues there that we're concerned about and expect normal seasonality in the back half of the year. Health care is another one. It's been a pretty good balance across transactions and solutions, a little tougher in the client space but health care is really doing well. Given the increases in costs and wage inflation and everything they're experiencing, they're needing more help on technology and people help as well.  So, we're actually seeing our value proposition with our health care customers accelerate in many ways, and you add our Sirius team into the mix here. And as I said before, it opens doors and gets more seats at the table. Health care is also equally feeling very robust. So, we don't have concerns of either of those end markets going into the end of the year. Yes, Ruplu. I would add -- look, let me just start with how we shape our view of the IT market, and it's substantially grounded in 11,000 customer-facing coworkers who are in market every day. And so there -- they've got the pulse of what's going on in the market and what customers are doing, saying and feeling. And while we have a number of market factors that we look at and analyze that the customer pulse is the most relevant one that we consider.  So, I'd just say that's 1 thing that we are looking at. And then we're factoring in as we think about the year, the caution and concern that we've already mentioned that, that will continue at least in the short run, and we've reflected that in our Q2 outlook. And then expecting some moderation in the back end, some moderating recovery in the back end. So, all of that combined is a reflection of, as I said, what we're seeing in the market, the current activity in terms of written demand, in terms of back order, in terms of all of the things that we triangulate. And frankly, that's just -- that's where we end up. because of what we're seeing because of seasonality. We've already kind of gone through Q2. It's going to feel about the same as Q1, right?  We'll get a little bump in seasonality, but that will be muted as Al mentioned earlier. And when you think about the back half of the year, what we have benefiting us there is seasonality from our government business, for example, and education running into the third quarter. And we also have lower overlaps, compares are easier in the last quarter. So, all of those things combined, you put them together, and that's just -- that's where we end up. Thank you. All right. Well, thank you very much. Let me close by reemphasizing my confidence in this team in our strategy and the durability of our resilient business model. Thank you to our CDW coworkers across the globe for your unwavering commitment to our customers. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. And Al and I look forward to seeing you next quarter."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my prepared remarks with detail in the first quarter. Move to capital allocation priorities and finish up with our 2023 outlook. Turning to our first quarter P&L on Slide 7. Consolidated net sales were $5.1 billion, down 14.2% on a reported basis and 15.6% on an average daily sales basis. Net sales results came in below expectations relative to our outlook. Transactions declined more than expected and despite greater resiliency and while flat year-over-year, Solutions also came in lower than anticipated. Notwithstanding the lower-than-expected solutions performance, the decline in transactions drove a mix shift that benefited margins. And as we've shift shared before, the impact of mixing into a higher relative percentage of solutions and specifically netted down revenue has a dampening effect on total net sales, but tends to bolster gross margins, all of equal.  Since we are not the primary obligor on these transactions, several important high-value components of our solutions portfolio, including Cloud, Software as a Service, much of security, and partner-delivered services and warranties are recorded on a netted down basis, where gross profit is our revenue. In the first quarter, these netted down revenues, and notably SaaS transactions outgrew our overall net sales and represented 32% of our gross profit compared to 31% in the fourth quarter and prior-year first quarter. This continues to be an important trend in our business. Sequential net sales were down 6.1% versus the fourth quarter on a reported basis and 7.6% on an average daily sales basis. Our outlook anticipated better than normal first quarter seasonality, given the unusually soft demand in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes public would have better than historical sequential growth, which it did. It also assumed our commercial channels, corporate and small business will remain firm and deliver close to historical sequential growth levels, they did not. The disconnect came from a downshift in large commercial customer spend, which had an adverse impact on our results. To dimensionalize the shortfall in net sales relative to our expectations, roughly two third of the amount was driven by large commercial customer activity across both transactional and solutions business. On the supply side, the dollar value of our backlog did not change meaningfully relative to the fourth quarter. And while the backlog and product lead times associated with transactional products are essentially back in line with normal levels, supply chain challenges have persisted in NetComm solutions and the backlog here remains elevated.  We continue to anticipate this remaining backlog will feather out over time as supply conditions ease. So, this has been more drawn out than anticipated. As always, we continue to judiciously manage our working capital to support our customers while ensuring strong economic returns. Our free cash flow performance which we'll discuss shortly is emblematic of this discipline. Our team delivered excellent profitability in the quarter. Gross profit was $1.1 billion, a year-over-year decrease of only 1%, despite a double-digit decline in sales. The gross profit margin was a first quarter record of 21.3%, up 280-basis points versus the prior year period and down only 40-basis points versus the record fourth quarter. The year-over-year expansion in gross profit margin was driven by similar factors as in the fourth quarter.  First, product margins benefited both mix into the complex, hybrid cloud solutions and a lower mix of transactional products. When we mix back index transactional products we expect for this benefit to moderate. Second, as we expected for the first quarter a greater mix in the netted down revenues. The category outpaced overall net sales growing low single digits in Q1 compared to Q1 in the prior year, primarily driven by double-digit Software as a Service growth; and third, net sales contribution from high-margin services mix with significant contribution from our recent acquisitions. Turning to SG&A on Slide 8. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $655 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP SG&A was primarily due to higher fixed payroll as our coworker count increased during last year. This was partially offset by a decline in sales payroll expense, reflecting the variable component of our compensation structure, which is principally tied to gross profit attainment. We expect the impact of the higher year-over-year fixed cost SG&A to diminish as we move through the year. To that end, we are focused on our efforts to innovate our operating model and drive productivity and savings. Given the demand environment, we've advanced initiatives to ensure our cost structure is aligned to our opportunity set. This includes driving structural savings as well as pacing our overall coworker count with the level of business demand and in the areas where we can provide the most value to our customers. Coworker count at the end of the first quarter was approximately 15,300 up slightly from the fourth quarter principally due to the most recent acquisition, which added to our technical resources in professional and managed services. Strategic investments in our solutions and services capabilities remain key to our three-part strategy for growth, an important catalyst for the achievement of our profitability and margin goals. GAAP operating income was $355 million, down $32 million compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income was $434 million, down $28 million versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income margin was strong at 8.5%, up 70-basis points from the prior year, although down 110-basis points compared to the record fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter, this year-over-year improvement was driven by our strong gross margin. The sequential decline reflected a higher ratio of fixed costs as a result of the lower volume of net sales and gross profit.  Moving to Slide 9. Interest expense was $58 million modestly above the prior year, driven by higher interest rates, but relatively in line with our expectation for the quarter. Our GAAP effective tax rate, shown on Slide 10 was 22.3%. This resulted in first quarter tax expense of $66 million. Together non-GAAP effective tax rate, we adjust taxes consistent with non-GAAP net income add-backs, as shown on Slide 11. For the quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.7%, within our expected range of 25.5% to 26.5%. As you can see on Slide 12, with fourth quarter weighted average diluted shares of $137 million, GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.68. Our non-GAAP net income was $279 million in the quarter, down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.03, down 7.9%.  Moving ahead to Slide 13, period-end Cash and cash equivalents were $279 million and net debt was $5.5 billion. During the quarter, we reduced our overall debt by almost $130 million, consistent with our plan to maintain our net leverage. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.3 billion.  Moving to Slide 14. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 18 days, down three days from the fourth quarter, two days from the prior year first quarter, and within our targeted range of high teens to low 20s, reflecting our continued diligent management of working capital. Our effective working capital management also drove excellent year-to-date free cash flow of $411 million, as shown on Slide 15. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2023 and capital allocation objectives, including returning $80 million to shareholders through dividends and $200 million in share repurchases in addition to the $130 million in debt repayment. We also closed the acquisition of Locus recruiting in February.  That brings me to our capital allocations on Slide 16. Our execution remained consistent with the updated objectives we communicated last quarter. First, as always, increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we increased the dividend 18% to $2.36 annually. This increase demonstrated our confidence in the earnings power and cash flow generation of the business. Going forward, we'll continue to target a 25% payout ratio, growing the dividend in line with earnings. Second, ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the first quarter at 2.6 times, flat to the end of the fourth quarter and within our new range of 2 times to 3 times.  We continue to convert business performance into cash generation and have a rigorous process in place to maintain our flexibility and proactively manage liquidity. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities is M&A and share repurchase have remained important drivers of shareholder value. For 2023, we'll continue to target returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned roughly 68%. As a reminder, the Board authorized a $750 million increase to the company's share repurchase program last quarter on top of the remaining dollars from the prior authorization.  Moving to the outlook for 2023 on Slide 17. The current overall IT market sentiment reflects the caution and prudence of customers. We expect this to continue in the near term with a modest recovery of demand conditions in the second half of the year. This informs our expectation that the IT market will contract at the upper end of high single digits. With this scenario as our baseline, we look for netted down revenues to continue to grow faster than our other product and solution categories. And we maintain our long-held expectation to outgrow the market by 200-basis to 300-basis points. Keeping in mind that in times of hardware softness, our overperformance tends to be on the lower end of this range and vice versa.  We continue to expect a neutral currency impact for the full year, with modest headwinds in the first half and modest tailwinds in the second half. This assumes an exchange rate of $1.25 to the British pound and $0.77 for the Canadian dollar. Moving down the P&L. We expect our full-year non-GAAP operating income margin to be within the range of 9%. This reflects the expectation of lower net sales and gross profit, balanced with higher gross margins and a reduction in the level of our fixed expenses.  Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings to decline low single digits year-over-year in constant currency. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 18. Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter. Related to average daily sales, we expect mid-single-digit sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. That equates to a low double-digit percent year-over-year reported net sales decline from the second quarter. We anticipate continued strong margin performance in the second quarter with a gross profit margin consistent with levels in Q1 and NGOI margin higher as expense efforts improve operating leverage. And we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to decline mid-single digits year-over-year. In 2023, we expect full-year free cash flow to be at the high end of our new rule of thumb range of 4% to 4.5% of net sales as we continue to emphasize a return on working capital. While we are clearly operating in a cautious and uncertain environment, given our resilient business model, the rigor of our financial controls, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the profitability margin and cash flow, our stakeholders have come to expect. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we will provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls.  And with that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yes. Good morning, Samik, this is Al. So, with respect to Q2, I think what you're seeing from our outlook is, again, both expectation that the overall conditions and customer buying behavior would be similar and particularly in commercial that is softer with an offset that, we'd expect that regular seasonality, particularly from our public business. would be in play. So, the lift there largely from that seasonality from public with a bit of a muting from our typical seasonality given the softer conditions otherwise. Now with respect to your question on the second half, so the second half, similar, we would expect we'd have our normal seasonality, including our government business and public having higher seasonality in Q3. And while obviously, we've got extreme conditions we've seen the last couple of quarters, we would anticipate at this point, a pickup in activity. Now that pickup in activity will say kind of balance between clients and solutions. And it's a little bit of a TBD exactly when you'd see client pick up, but there's a reason to believe that we'd see some of that activity in the back half of the year. Yes, Eric, let me take that. This is Al. So just a couple of things. You're definitely right with respect to netted down revenues and the impact from that. The other component is obviously you have a mix component. If you think about the broader IT market relative to our mix, there is a translation, if you will. I think most notably, in normalized years that does not create significant distortion in a year like this where the mix has shifted significantly. That is client coming down considerably and more solutions and netted down revenues being up. It does create more exaggerated results.  So, what I would tell you is if you think about our full year guide with respect to the IT market, it is high single digits decline, if we think about that on a gross spend basis, Obviously, that would be more muted than that decline. Does that help you? Yes. Sure, Adam. Happy to address that. So, on the back half, first of all, let me just say the, our expectation that Q2 would look a lot like Q1 obviously informs then the seasonality for the rest of the year, right, because we would apply our typical seasonality. Q3 definitely reflects, I'll call it, reasonably normal public seasonality.  And so, you have that in play. Look, the comps, frankly, for Q3 are much tougher than Q4. Q4 was really the first time that we felt the effect of softening and particularly in client. And so, I think Q3 probably looks a little bit more normalized from a seasonality perspective. And then Q4, I'll call it more of the pickup there, particularly given the lower comps that we saw there with education and with client. Adam, I'll just add a couple of comments to your questions on productivity and hitting on our goals, if you will. So, to Chris' point, look, this was not a reaction. We had been pacing our hiring and our coworker count and our discretionary spend in the quarter is building up. Obviously, we saw a sharp turn in Q1, and we expect some of that to persist.  We had structural efforts, activities in place to drive productivity and savings, and we basically just amplified those efforts. So, let me just parse it for you when we think about kind of allocation of our coworkers, first from a revenue-producing GP and going through something like this, we're looking at where are the areas and the practice areas that the demand vectors are stronger and we should allocate more resources and where areas where maybe that demand could be softer for a more prolonged period. And so that was part of the calculus in going through that. And then when we think about kind of more of the support layer and the infrastructure, again, we got structural initiatives, but we also expect that we're going to drive productivity, coworker savings from that. And so, there are all the things that went into this decision and these actions. And we believe while difficult, obviously, to go through, ultimately, we'll add the greatest value for our customers. and obviously, improve efficiency. And Matt, maybe just let me add just a couple of comments. Number one is just recall that warranty business shows up as netted down revenues. For us, the recognition is upfront. And so therefore, if we have a typical four-year warranty, that turns into a one year, obviously, the recognition and the result for us obviously becomes muted. The other element I would just add here and look, maybe somewhat obvious is just the -- some of this focus on shorter ROI and the financial impacts therein are creating more conversations that will come back around with customers. That is the -- there's a sweating assets, but an expectation that, that business will come back around, both in terms of refreshing some of the infrastructure and some of the clients, but as well as, in some cases, renewals of software assurance software and warranties that we're seeing in a little bit shorter duration here. And maybe Ruplu, just one component I'd add there is just the -- just remember, one of the big drivers always is funding. And we would say, from a funding perspective, both government and education, we're at a reasonable level there. So, we think that there certainly is the impetus and catalyst there for continued spending. Let me just maybe Ruplu, start on the backlog. So, backlog, not a meaningful contributor in our expectations I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that NetComm continues to be a sticking point. We would expect that to feather out. It's taken longer, but we would not consider that to be a meaningful contribution for the remainder of the year. So."

I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our third quarter performance and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Market conditions in the third quarter were challenging. While demand for cloud solutions remained strong, and we continue to see a pickup in client device growth. Hardware solutions remained under pressure and the firmer footing we anticipated for our corporate channel did not materialize. Within this complex environment, the team delivered gross profit of $1.2 billion, 2% lower than last year and gross margin of 21.8%. Net sales of $5.5 billion, 3.5% lower on an average daily sales basis, non-GAAP operating income of $534 million, down 4% year-over-year; non-GAAP net income per share of $2.63, down 3% year-over-year; adjusted free cash flow of $261 million. While our success meeting customer priorities with cost-effective software and cloud solutions as well as services led to a resilient gross margin and strong cash flow, results did not meet our expectations as lower-than-projected solutions hardware drove a shortfall in volume. This shortfall in volume reflects both external factors and CDW-specific dynamics. Let's take a look at each of these and most importantly, the actions in place to mitigate future impacts. First, the macro and IT spending environment remain challenging. Technology complexity combined with persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty has led to large project delays and further extension of sales cycles. Layered on top was the uncertainty around the outcome of the U.S. election, which has dampened not only government spending, but also other public sector end markets, as well as spend from commercial customers. And finally, this limited demand environment has heightened competition and increased pricing intensity across all end markets. Beyond the current environment, market conditions continue to reflect the secular shifts we've experienced over the past several years, shifts that impact how customers consume IT and how customers pay for IT. Consumption shifts driven by as-a-service and pay-as-you-go public and private cloud focus have contributed to market pressure on hardware solutions. And while our conviction toward a hybrid cloud approach for IT is unwavering, market demand continues to reflect unprecedented hardware cyclicality, cyclicality that resulted from pandemic-driven demand for work and learn from anywhere on endpoint, collaboration and netcomm solutions, which resulted in an off-cycle demand boom, a period of supply chain volatility and subsequent digestion. All of these external factors have clearly impacted our results in the quarter and over the past year. The impact has been further amplified by three CDW-specific dynamics. The first dynamic relates to our long-standing financial discipline. While our North Star is to provide value to our customers in highly competitive markets, we maintain our discipline when competitors pursue transactions at uneconomic terms. While this contributed to lower third quarter sales and gross profit, our gross and operating margins held firm even while we mixed into lower-margin client devices. We have seen this market behavior before and expect it to dissipate as the demand environment improves. Second, our exposure to larger deals. As we have deepened and broadened our strategic capabilities, including through the addition of Sirius, our ability to deliver large, full stack, full outcome projects has expanded, projects at the higher dollar tier that can be pushed for any number of reasons. This can drive year-over-year performance lumpiness and depending on the size and timing of decisions, impact results. Impact that is more acute during periods of low demand. You see this in commercial and federal this quarter where larger deals expected to close were deferred or reduced. And the third specific item pertains to our cloud and SaaS-based business. While we have grown this business significantly during the past several years, we have not yet achieved the scale we desire relative to our overall portfolio. As such, when demand for hardware softens, it has a more outsized impact on our financial results. I hope this perspective helps contextualize how CDW-specific dynamics amplified the impact of the low market demand environment and created a near-term growth challenge that we have not yet been able to overcome. These are not excuses. We own our results. So let's turn to what's important. What are we doing? As always, our continuous improvement in seller effectiveness is ongoing. This means delivering repeatable solutions and further streamlining the sales processes to maximize sales professional productivity. I'd like to highlight three additional focus areas. First, we are organically and inorganically growing our capabilities in the fastest growth, highest relevance cloud and software vectors to increase scale in both our services and as-a-service offerings. This will deliver greater choice and value to our customers and lead to greater recurring and reoccurring revenue streams. Second, we are further driving exceptional and differentiated customer experience in our core business. We are aligning our digital capabilities to serve customers in the way they want to plan, buy, consume and manage technology. And finally, we are enhancing our agility and accelerating pipeline growth. We are building on our customer growth engine by opening new lanes with both existing and new customers, and we are deepening our technical and industry expertise across all end markets. We know more than anything, customers value our unbiased highly informed point of view, a point of view that enables our ability to architect and implement full stack multi-branded solutions, which cut through the noise and deliver the outcomes our customers need. These are not new efforts, but we have ramped up intensity. Work is underway and progress is on track. Some actions will have fairly immediate impact and some will take more time to produce results. In the meantime, we remain laser-focused on finding pools of profitable growth and converting sales with rigor and speed. Now let's take a deeper look at quarterly results. Third quarter corporate net sales decreased 4% as sales cycles further elongated, most notably for large infrastructure investments. netcomm storage and servers all declined by significant double digits. We helped customers with client refresh, driving growth of high single digits. ASPs remained strong as customers' preference continued to drive higher-end devices. Cloud solutions was a priority and gross profit from cloud increased by double digits. Small business continued to bounce along the bottom with net sales down 2%. Cloud solutions remained strong given their low upfront commitment and customers continue to sweat data center assets. Unlike other channels, client refresh continues to be pushed out as customers remain in a cash preservation mode. Security was strong as cyber threats increased for lower profile businesses. The team's success delivering services drove strong double-digit growth in both professional and managed services. Public performance was less than seasonal and sales decreased 5% year-over-year. Health care was a bright spot in the quarter, delivering top line growth of 3%. The team continued its success helping health systems adopt managed services and cloud solutions to better control expenses, and they delivered strong double-digit growth in services and cloud spend. Similar to corporate, netcomm storage and servers all declined meaningfully. Client was strong, up double digits for the second quarter in a row. Government declined 12% with both state and local and federal government performance below seasonal in the quarter. Market conditions were challenging for the federal team. Demand impact was felt most acutely in large hardware solutions deals with federal posting double-digit declines in both netcomm and servers. Several agencies moved ahead with refresh and for the third quarter in a row, client devices increased by double digits. Cloud Solutions posted a double-digit increase in cloud gross profit. State and local sales declined by low double digits. Delays due to increased scrutiny and multiple approvals impacted large infrastructure hardware deals with netcomm storage and servers all posting significant declines. Security remained a top priority, posting a strong double-digit increase in gross profit. Services performance was strong, up high double digits, driven by professional services. Education sales declined 5%. Higher ed's top line declined high single digits. Client devices were flat and slow project materialization and budget constraints and cutbacks at some public universities contributed to double-digit declines in netcomms and servers. The team's success helping institutions implement cloud solutions to drive cost elasticity delivered double-digit growth in cloud spend and gross profit. K-12 net sales declined by low single digits, largely driven by declines in audiovisual and netcomm as school systems digested investments made over the past few years. The team continued to help refresh aging Chromebooks and delivered high teens client device growth. Cloud delivered double-digit gross profit growth. Services adoption was also up double digits, driven by our managed client device life cycle solution, which streamlines the configuration, deployment, management and a refresh process so school systems can focus on what really matters, their students. Other, our combined U.K. and Canada business performed above our expectations, up 5%. Both markets experienced stronger demand, albeit off depressed results in the prior year and prior quarter. Both the U.K. and Canada increased by similar amounts in local currency. As you can see, end market performance was mixed during the quarter. Let's take a look at how this translated to category performance. Portfolio performance reflected our ability to meet customers where and how they want it with client device, cloud and software and services growth, growth that was more than offset by hardware solutions decline. A low single-digit increase in transactions was more than offset by solution sales decreases of double digits. Hardware decreased 7%. High single-digit client device growth was more than offset by declines in netcomm storage and servers. Software increased 3.5% with healthy gross profit growth. Cloud was an important driver of this performance, up double digits in gross profit. Services increased by 13%, driven by managed services and warranties. As you can see, while demand varied, the diversity and completeness of our portfolio enables us to meet our customers where and how they need us. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Given current conditions, we do not anticipate market demand to improve for the balance of the year, and we now look for the U.S. IT market to be roughly flat with 2023. We expect our results to continue to reflect the market and CDW-specific dynamics I referenced with gross profit growth challenged, given our mix of hardware and the pronounced cyclicality the market is experiencing. As we always do, we will provide our view on 2025 market conditions in our next call. There's no denying that we are operating in a tough environment, but we are confident that growth will return. The demand drivers are there, workload expansion and data explosion, increased security threats, client device obsolescence and adoption of AI-powered assistance and applications. And when demand picks up, we will be there to profitably capture these opportunities. In the meantime, we are doubling our efforts to drive profitable growth. While this past year has been challenging for us, it has also been challenging for our customers. As they're a trusted adviser, customers need us now more than ever. Our relationships are bolstered by our commitment to deliver value to our customers regardless of the demand environment. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook.\nAl Miralles: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our third quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our updated 2024 outlook. Third quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion was down 2.2% versus the prior year. This was below our original expectations of low single-digit growth as strength in cloud and client devices across most channels was offset by lower demand for solutions hardware. Gross margin of 21.8% was flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and broadly in line with both full year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024. Third quarter margin was aided by a higher mix into sales or CDW act as agent, also known as netted down revenues. This category grew by 7.1% on a reported basis, once again outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 35.7% of our gross profit compared to 32.6% in the prior year third quarter. Year-over-year expansion came from our teams continuing to successfully serve customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. This led to our highest quarterly netted down revenues we've seen as a company as we met customers where they needed us most. The netted down category of solutions continues to represent an important and durable trend within our business. Third quarter gross profit was up 1.5% sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2024 on a reported basis. Net sales were up 1.7% sequentially as well. Higher year-over-year demand in the health care and international channels alongside a sequential increase in government drove growth over the second quarter. However, this growth is below both historic seasonal levels and our own expectations as the firmer footing in the corporate space that we saw at the end of the second quarter did not persist through the later months of the third quarter. We experienced deals getting pushed out and downsized as customers deliberate on where and when to spend and primarily in the solutions space. While international outpaced the U.S. business in the third quarter, we still expect volatility in this space as customers face economic and political uncertainty. Overall, we're competing in a challenging low-growth environment, and we are focused on achieving profitable growth. We acknowledge that we have work to do to better calibrate market conditions and deliver on our own expectations. Turning to expenses for the second [ph] quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $667 million, down 0.7% year-over-year. Expenses were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and the efficiency ratio of non-GAAP SG&A to gross profit of 55.5% was relatively in line with our expectations. We continue to look to align our cost structure with demand and have taken actions early in the fourth quarter to better align expenses to market conditions. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was approximately 15,400, up slightly over the second quarter and modestly above year-end. Customer-facing coworker count was also up slightly at approximately 11,200. Our goal is to balance growth and exceptional customer experience with greater efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $534 million, down 4% versus the prior year, driven by our volume shortfall, offset by slightly lower expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.7% was down from 9.9% in the prior year, but up from 9.4% in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP net income of $355 million in the quarter, down 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. With third quarter weighted average diluted shares of 134.9 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.63. Moving ahead to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $4.9 billion. Net debt is down $91 million from the second quarter and has decreased by approximately $184 million since year-end 2023. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 2030 senior notes and $600 million of 2034 senior notes. We issued the combined $1.2 billion to settle the tender offers of both the 2024 and 2025 senior notes and for general corporate purposes that will maximize strategic flexibility. Since Q3 end, we have fully redeemed the 2024 notes. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.2 billion. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, up 2 days from the prior year and at the lower end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including active management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted free cash flow was $261 million in the quarter, roughly consistent with our expectations. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $764 million and 80% of our non-GAAP net income within our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90% of non-GAAP net income. We are on track to meet our 2024 objectives. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $100 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with our non-GAAP net income growth. We're announcing an approximate 1% increase of our dividend to $2.50 annually, our 11th consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to prudently manage our dividend with respect to the growth environment and target a roughly 25% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward. Our second priority is to have the right capital structure in place. We ended the third quarter at 2.3 times net leverage within our targeted range of 2 to 3 times. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility as evidenced by our recent debt financings. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth. Year-to-date, we've utilized over $350 million of cash on share repurchases and have over $730 million of authorization remaining under our current share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023 have persisted well into 2024. Demand has been below what we originally anticipated and customer sentiment remains cautious across the majority of end markets. Last quarter, we spoke about the slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending and shared our expectations for tough conditions to persist in the near term. That was the case and was moderately worse than we even expected in the third quarter. Customers still have a compelling need to address priorities such as cloud workload growth, increasing security threats, aging client devices, but uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape continue to weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware. Given these conditions, our updated 2024 expectation is for a low single digit gross profit decline. This implies seasonality slightly below historical levels for the fourth quarter and second half gross profit and net sales. We maintain our expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full year 2023 and much like we've seen year-to-date in 2024. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be down mid single digits year-over-year. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter. We anticipate low to mid single-digit gross profit declines compared to the prior year, with gross margins slightly above the first three quarters of 2024, but below the fourth quarter 2023 level. This leads to a slightly worse than seasonal sequential fourth quarter. Traditionally, the fourth quarter is meaningfully lower than the third quarter, principally due to seasonally lower demand from education and government customers. But this first fourth quarter, we also do not anticipate this being offset by seasonally strong demand from corporate and small business customers. Moving down the P&L. We expect fourth quarter operating expenses to be similar to the level of fourth quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis. Finally, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to decline in the high single-digit range year-over-year. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'd now like to open the lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question, excuse me. Our first question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam, your line is now open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. And good morning. I just wanted to start, as we analyze this quarter, I understand tough macro to predict volumes. But I really wanted to ask about the negative operating leverage down the P&L. And taking a step back, I think what investors really like about CDW is the variable cost model and ability to kind of flex up and down with volumes. I understand some of the rationale in the prepared remarks, but this seems to be a pattern for the past few quarters. So I guess the question would be twofold. One for Chris. If you could maybe just assess what is changing and why the negative drop-through is increasingly severe down the P&L. It sounds like you decided to implement some restructuring. So maybe you can tie in some of the rationale for that. And then secondly, for Al, on that restructuring, if you could just help us with the size and what it does to the model in 2025. I think it's about a 10% to 15% of headcount based on the reports that we've seen. So just trying to rightsize how we should think about OpEx moving forward. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Yeah, Adam, actually, this is Al. I will start just to give you a little bit of commentary on the quarter and operating leverage, and I'll let Chris jump in thereafter. So first - on the quarter, first, I would just say, Adam, we continue to hold strongly to our variable cost model and the impact therein. For the quarter, if you actually look at our non-GAAP SG&A expenses relative to GP, we came in just about at that 55% range, which we've talked about that being kind of the target that we would have. It's maybe slightly higher than we would have anticipated for the quarter, but that was more of a, I'll call it, denominator factor that is the GP was lower than expected. So in the quarter, we did get the movement in our variable expenses as we would expect. I think the challenge there otherwise, Adam, is that we have a fixed cost base. And while the demand environment has moved pretty dramatically, we certainly have taken action on our fixed cost to try to align with what we were seeing in current demand and what we were seeing as we go forward, it becomes a matter of just the timing therein on that fixed cost base. That said, as you know, going into the fourth quarter, we did take some actions that would reduce our fixed cost base, and that included a reduction in our workforce. Just to size that for you, Adam, it was about 2% of our workforce. So it was not at the level that you quoted there. But certainly, that would align us more closely with where we think we need to be from a fixed cost base perspective.\nChris Leahy: Yeah. And Adam, I would just add that we're being very prudent as we look at where we rightsize the business while we continue to invest behind areas that we see will be pockets of growth. So a lot of focus on the demand environment, preserving profitability and also delivering exceptional customer experience for our teams.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Thank you. Just a quick clarification since I know that was a long one. When you're talking about the increased pricing intensity and competition, just to clarify, is that higher competition between VARs? Or is that higher competition in pricing amongst the OEM vendors? Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Yes, Adam, it's a little of both. It's a little of both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vogt of UBS. David, your line is now open.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. And maybe one for Chris to start. So Chris, I think I heard in your prepared remarks that you'd expect sort of the U.S. IT market to be flat in 2024 and yet you're confident that you can continue to outgrow it. But obviously, the macro has been tough and it looks like you're going to undergrow the market this year. Did I hear that correctly? And how should we think about what that means going forward? I know you're not giving 2025 guidance, but I think that's a little bit disappointing relative to where investors might have been thinking given the challenging backdrop. Is it just really a reflection of where the hardware solutions are ending up? And then along those lines, we're hearing from some of our checks that networking and even to a lesser degree, storage and servers is getting a little bit better. Maybe what are you seeing a little bit differently than maybe what we're picking up and what others are maybe communicating in the marketplace? Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah. Let me just start with the market share. That was the beginning of the question. Look, we continue to hold ourselves accountable for delivering a premium to the IT market rate of growth. And looking at this year and this quarter, given the low hardware demand and taking into account our mix, I'd say we're holding serve and feeling very confident that we've performed extremely well in certain areas, take cloud, Software as a Service, services as an example, but other areas have been challenged for us. And our view is that hardware will come back. It's a matter of when will that inflection point take place, and we'll be well positioned to help our customers in those circumstances. You asked specifically about networking and storage. Look, what we are seeing is we're seeing traction in clients pick up. And I wouldn't yet call it the inflection point, but we do think we're outperforming in that area. Data center has really been the area where customers have paused, have moved spend to the cloud and are taking longer time to make decisions. That means we're seeing storage, networking and servers all quite muted. But once we see the client refresh start, one would expect to see data center begin to pick up again. As I said before, the catalysts are all there. Explosion in data, the need for massive bandwidth for networking, digital transformation isn't going anywhere. Security continues to get more and more focused. So the catalysts for growth are all there. I think we just got to get to the other side of the uncertainty that we sit. And certainly, after we get through the election, there'll be a little more certainty.\nAl Miralles: And David, maybe I'll just add there.\nDavid Vogt: And maybe just - sorry, go ahead, Al.\nAl Miralles: It's okay. Just to add a couple of data points there. So obviously, all of those categories, Chris mentioned in the solutions space have been softer. We also have the tough comps from a netcomm perspective. Q3 is the last quarter with those tough comps. So while we would not say that demand is picking up meaningfully on netcomm, at least the comps get a bit easier. And then the other data point I would just give you is from our vantage point, just hardware overall, we've now seen eight quarters of declines on hardware. And so again, Chris noted some of the catalysts we think ultimately will play out. We've seen a pretty prolonged period of hardware cyclicality.\nDavid Vogt: Great. And just as a quick follow-up. So when we think about looking at the recovery or the potential recovery around the timing of the recovery? I know you're not giving '25 outlook. But what are some of the milestones that you're looking at that gives you increased confidence heading into '25? I know obviously, the election is coming up and hopefully, that kind of changes maybe customer conversations. Anything else sort of maybe at a high level that you're thinking about in your conversations that give you some degree of maybe a leading edge or a leading indicator in terms of what you're thinking about for 2025?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. I think about the things that are creating the current environment and whether or not those change. So uncertainty around the economic environment and geopolitical will have an impact. Obviously, the election policy outcomes of the election are going to be very different. That will have an impact most likely. Those are the things that are at the forefront of our mind, how the economy is doing, frankly, how it's perceived to be doing, going to be doing in the future and the volatility across the world are the two things that we look at most closely. Now the complexity in IT is not going anywhere. So the requirement now to have more business and IT leaders involved in decision-making. It's our new norm is kind of longer decision cycles for these larger complex projects. And so we're getting used to that, but we don't see that going away anytime soon. That's what we focus on.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you, guys.\nAl Miralles: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Eric, your line is now open.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Chris, if we could just go back to some of your comments on product demand. Obviously, lots of commentary about challenges in Infrastructure Solutions, double-digit declines with many customers across netcomm, servers and storage. I just want to make sure I understand, are those rates of declines that you're referencing reflective of the broader market? Or are you seeing those declines simply because you are walking away from some lower profitability deals and therefore, you are underperforming in those specific end markets. And maybe at the end market, they aren't declining nearly as much as maybe you're seeing. I'd just love to get a better understanding of this is kind of CDW's view or if this is the broader market view? And then I just have a follow-up. Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, sure. I would say it is the broader market view, possibly tempered a bit by CDW not racing to the bottom because we are walking away from economic deals. It's important to keep - protect profitability, et cetera. So I would say it's a bit of both. I would say it is market and consistent with market, but also we are not racing to the bottom.\nErik Woodring: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the second question, I'd love if you could maybe elaborate a bit on the market competition comments because you're highlighting market competition, which I can't necessarily remember you citing explicitly before. And to be fair, you guys have encountered several challenging and competitive market environments in the history of the company and still managed to materially outperform peers over those years. And so maybe my question is just what has changed with competition that is new? And really why would that competitive intensity ever go away even in a period of stronger demand? Thanks so much.\nChris Leahy: Yeah. It's a great question, and we do reflect on that. We are used to highly competitive environment. What I would say we're feeling right now and this quarter and the past couple of quarters, in particular, is irrational pricing. And we know how to compete in the market, but we are seeing deals at below margin, low margin, et cetera, and that just is not our business model. The last time I saw intensity in pricing like this was years ago. So it has been a little bit more unique over the last couple of quarters, and we're very good with our discipline around financials. So we're holding firm. That's really the answer here. It's a little unique over the last couple of quarters. We've seen it really tick up.\nErik Woodring: And just to clarify, that is rational pricing from VARs, from distis or from both?\nChris Leahy: I would say it's up and down the value chain. So competitors who are value-added resellers, direct competitors, distributors, I wouldn't perceive as in that chain as much.\nErik Woodring: Okay. Thank you so much, Chris.\nChris Leahy: Yes, the behaviors that are going on, every competitor is feeling the elongation in the sales cycle. The chunking up agreements to make them smaller, the deferrals, the reductions, the different ways they want to go at saving money or deferring spending, short-term ROIs. That is a market dynamic right now that everybody is feeling.\nErik Woodring: Understood. Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Your line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Good morning. I have two as well. I guess, Chris, just to conclude this discussion you had, you folks are on track to have 2 years of consecutive gross profit declines at the company. And it's something you haven't seen at CDW, I think, historically, even if I go back to '03, '04 or '07, '08 time frame. I understand all the macros that you're talking about, but it feels like the way CDW is navigating this macro uncertainty volatility is worse than what you've seen before. And why do you think that's happening? And what's changed perhaps in the company that you've had multiple years of gross profit declines, which frankly, you haven't had historically?\nChris Leahy: Yeah, Amit, fair question. I'll tell you, we're a company in transformation, and we have been in transformation for several years now. So when you think about the CDW - CDW-specific factors I mentioned, they have been having a real impact on results, amplified by the muted hardware demand environment. So if we just think about the third one I mentioned, which is our cloud and SaaS business, we've been investing behind that business and growing it incredibly rapidly over the last 5 years. All of our acquisitions have had a cloud services hook to them. Nonetheless, given the full portfolio that we have, we have not yet attained the scale that we want to be at relative to the full portfolio. So when hardware is muted, it now has even more of an outsized impact because of the secular movement towards cloud. And we're growing that, but we still have a very high mix of hardware. The other thing is the strategic investments that we've made over the year have been incredibly fruitful in developing broader and deeper strategic capabilities so that we can deliver full stack, full outcomes projects. These now we're seeing at much larger, higher dollar tier levels, and those are the kind of projects that are lumpy. We used to talk about this with our federal contracts all the time. The very big deals become lumpier. And depending on when decisions are made, they can get deferred, they can move around, the size can change, and therefore, it can impact results. And we saw that with commercial and federal this quarter. And the last one is what I just talked about in the prior question, which is our financial discipline. We're going to continue to maintain our gross margin discipline as we move forward. And we've hit a couple of quarters where we're seeing behavior that is extreme - pricing behavior that's extreme. So I just - Amit, I'd say it is a combination of our strategic investments that are working incredibly well vis-\u00e0-vis value to the customer and growth in fast-growing high-relevance areas in an environment where hardware has been and continues to be muted on a persistent basis. It's a bit of a double whammy for us. But I'm confident in the growth as hardware turns around. Go ahead, Amit.\nAmit Daryanani: No, I'll let you finish.\nChris Leahy: No, I was just going to say...\nAmit Daryanani: You know, growth.\nChris Leahy: Go Amit.\nAmit Daryanani: I was going to say, Chris, would it be fair to say that as growth resumes presumably in '25 that you should start to see gross profit dollars increase back to the way it normally does? I think that would be a fair way to think about it. And then maybe my clarification was going to be, we've heard from Cisco and Microsoft, some of your bigger vendors and how they're changing their channel pricing and the channel strategy for 2025. Do you see that being a bit of a driver for you as you think about your growth, especially the agent sales piece of the business into next year and beyond?\nChris Leahy: Yeah. As I think about the changes, I think about investing behind our cloud business and really the cloud flywheel where we are trying to - we are delivering a seamless experience from professional managed services to consumption and transaction-based services to managed services around the cloud. And by doing that, delivering higher value to our customers, but that's precisely aligned with what our vendors are the CSPs, the Ciscos of the world exactly aligned with what they - what they're incenting and what they want. So we think we're well positioned, and that will be a positive benefit for us as we move into 2025 and beyond because it aligns with our strategy and our value that we can deliver to customers. And frankly, it drives - because of the services wraparound, it drives better economics for CDW and a stickier relationship with the customer.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just another question regarding the comments on client device growth. I think you said mid single-digit growth, but it sounds like that was skewed more toward the public markets and not so much corporate and SMB. And you talked about macro. Is the expectation for AI PCs? Is that another reason why we're seeing that push out? And are you seeing any kind of growth in corporate SMB versus enterprise there?\nChris Leahy: Yeah, Matt, thanks for the question. On the client side, we're actually seeing - we're seeing growth across almost all of the end markets. Corporate was - we saw growth in corporate. It small business is where we are seeing our customers kind of in a cash preservation mode and so pushing off the client device. But we really have seen a nice pickup in client across almost all the end markets. So that's been positive.\nAl Miralles: Yeah. And Matt, I'll just add the - what has been driving it has been more refresh of aging fleets and need for customers to get on with this activity. It's been less in the way of Win 11 drivers and less in the way of AI PCs.\nChris Leahy: So next year, as AI PCs do come on board, that will be another nice accelerant for PC refresh.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then relative to your guidance on gross margin, Al, for Q4, which is down year-over-year, and you had a big bump last year. Is that because you're expecting sort of a lower percentage of the advanced hardware solutions, which carries higher margins or services? What are the other reasons behind that?\nAl Miralles: Yeah. Great question, Matt. It anticipates that we'll continue to see softness in the solutions side of the business, which comes at moderately higher gross margins. It assumes that client will continue to tick along, not in an outsized way, but that client would continue to move along. And then we would expect that we would get your typical pickup in more of the netted down revenues in the fourth quarter. I'll just note the delta versus Q4 of 2023 is that maybe a little bit modest pick there on the netted down revenues versus last year because it was quite outsized at the end of the year.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, your line is now open.\nKeith Housum: Thank you. Two questions as well, if I could. Chris, just trying to reconcile something here. CDW has always tied itself as being a relationship driven company providing value for its customers. But yet we're hearing about transactional competition and losing deals that way. Perhaps can you break it out for us like how much of the business is more transactional where people are just going with the lowest price versus how much of your business is really driven by that relationship and the value you provide?\nChris Leahy: I would say that when you look at our portfolio and the spectrum of our relationships with our customers, that over 90% of those relationships and those customers would tell you that they buy from CDW because of the value we deliver, the access to a full portfolio, the expertise that we bring to bear, the ease with which they can do business, the agility with which we deliver that is what every customer says to me when I meet with them. Regarding the pricing and the transaction issues, there are times when there are large rollouts, for example, that - where the economics just gets lower and lower and lower. And those are transaction purchases that don't typically have the value wrapped around, and those are the ones that we are less interested in pursuing.\nKeith Housum: Okay. Appreciate it. And then you talked about like the move to the as-a-service model. I guess as I think about that, it's still relatively in its infancy, but it's only going to grow as we go from here. So how much of, I guess, a challenge or a headwind does that present to hardware sales as we kind of think about just the future?\nChris Leahy: I didn't hear the whole question. I'm sorry.\nAl Miralles: I think I got it, Keith. Here's what I would say. Obviously, we've seen pronounced cyclicality in hardware, and that would typically be pretty significant upfront spend. Think about that as kind of CapEx from a customer's perspective. What we've seen kind of counteracting that in some respects is an increase in our netted down revenues, including SaaS and cloud. Now Keith, historically, a lot of that business would be what we would call reoccurring where we are both seeing that business upfront and recognizing that upfront. But I would say that over the last year or 2, more of that business has been moving to a recurring nature. And that is where customers are more making judgments on what they want to spend on cloud, but they're consuming it as they go. And therefore, that shows up over time for us. Now I wouldn't call that a material dollar amount at this point, but it is growing. And therefore, I would say that is part of the calculus of kind of the air pocket when you have pronounced cyclicality of hardware and more business that starts to come on as we go. Certainly, as we continue to grow that sector in that category, we'll report more on kind of that split in details with respect to reoccurring business versus recurring. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nKeith Housum: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Samik, your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess if I can start with one. Chris, you mentioned in your prepared remarks and in some of the responses as well, the exposure to large projects that you have on account of the capabilities that you've invested in over the years. I mean, as you outlined some actions you're taking on the cost structure side. But as you look at the business and the lumpiness that, that drives in terms of exposure to large projects, are there any changes you're contemplating on that side in balancing out the business between larger projects or transactions versus do you still - or do you still believe that's the right sort of balance or margin mix to have in the portfolio and really just wait for the market to come back on that front? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah. The way I'd answer that question is kind of yes and yes. In other words, we do have actions underway. Look, we're looking at this quarter in 2025 as an opportunity to accelerate the most important parts of our strategy that we've been working on for several years. But one of them, for example, would be our digital work. We've done a lot of foundational work in digital, and we just need to go faster. And that really means aligning our digital capabilities and our people to deliver personalized recommendations that match how customers want to buy, plan, consume and manage their assets. So think about this in terms of large deals and perhaps smaller deals as an intersection of our sales professionals moving up a value chain and being available to learn and enabled by digital tools to sell at the highest point of the value chain while creating a seamless digital experience for our customers, a flywheel, if you will, so that we can deliver both velocity in that digital flywheel and serve customers how they'd like to be served, self-serve, et cetera, and value with our account managers and sales professionals working together. So that's one area, as an example, where we - our intention is to drive velocity in deals at all sizes, lower-tier levels while we continue to build engagements at high value, high levels.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And, thank you for that. Quickly for my clarification question. I know you mentioned the election-related uncertainty and some of the slower spend on the public sector federal side as well. I mean we've seen elections in the past as well. Have you had instances or are you looking at any scenarios in which you do end up getting like a budget flush post the election outcomes? Are there any sort of scenarios or any indications of that happening in the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yeah, hard to tell. I would say this election cycle, I wouldn't - I would say there's nothing really normal about it. So hard to tell. I mean, right now, what's happening with the federal government is we've got the knock-on effects from the delayed budget previously. And now we've got - while we saw strong spending in the Department of Defense, we're seeing less than we'd hoped because they're waiting to see what the administration's priorities are. So we - right now, we just see the federal government paused. One would hope we'll have some more clarity post election, but then the timing comes down to Congress and the President in getting a budget passed.\nAl Miralles: And maybe, Samik, I'll just add on the back end there. Obviously, we play all of the different scenarios and how things could play out when we look at the quarterly outlooks. I would say our Q4 outlook has the appropriate level of caution baked into it based on all the factors that we've talked about, the external factors, TDW specific, and certainly, that would include any political uncertainty.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.\nAl Miralles: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. We currently have no further questions. So I'd like to hand back to Chris Leahy, Chair and CEO, for any closing remarks.\nChris Leahy: Okay. Thank you, operator. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our 15,000 coworkers around the globe. It's their ongoing commitment to our customers in this challenging environment that makes us successful over the long term. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: As we conclude today's call, we would like to thank everyone for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our third quarter performance and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Market conditions in the third quarter were challenging. While demand for cloud solutions remained strong, and we continue to see a pickup in client device growth. Hardware solutions remained under pressure and the firmer footing we anticipated for our corporate channel did not materialize. Within this complex environment, the team delivered gross profit of $1.2 billion, 2% lower than last year and gross margin of 21.8%. Net sales of $5.5 billion, 3.5% lower on an average daily sales basis, non-GAAP operating income of $534 million, down 4% year-over-year; non-GAAP net income per share of $2.63, down 3% year-over-year; adjusted free cash flow of $261 million. While our success meeting customer priorities with cost-effective software and cloud solutions as well as services led to a resilient gross margin and strong cash flow, results did not meet our expectations as lower-than-projected solutions hardware drove a shortfall in volume. This shortfall in volume reflects both external factors and CDW-specific dynamics. Let's take a look at each of these and most importantly, the actions in place to mitigate future impacts. First, the macro and IT spending environment remain challenging. Technology complexity combined with persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty has led to large project delays and further extension of sales cycles. Layered on top was the uncertainty around the outcome of the U.S. election, which has dampened not only government spending, but also other public sector end markets, as well as spend from commercial customers. And finally, this limited demand environment has heightened competition and increased pricing intensity across all end markets. Beyond the current environment, market conditions continue to reflect the secular shifts we've experienced over the past several years, shifts that impact how customers consume IT and how customers pay for IT. Consumption shifts driven by as-a-service and pay-as-you-go public and private cloud focus have contributed to market pressure on hardware solutions. And while our conviction toward a hybrid cloud approach for IT is unwavering, market demand continues to reflect unprecedented hardware cyclicality, cyclicality that resulted from pandemic-driven demand for work and learn from anywhere on endpoint, collaboration and netcomm solutions, which resulted in an off-cycle demand boom, a period of supply chain volatility and subsequent digestion. All of these external factors have clearly impacted our results in the quarter and over the past year. The impact has been further amplified by three CDW-specific dynamics. The first dynamic relates to our long-standing financial discipline. While our North Star is to provide value to our customers in highly competitive markets, we maintain our discipline when competitors pursue transactions at uneconomic terms. While this contributed to lower third quarter sales and gross profit, our gross and operating margins held firm even while we mixed into lower-margin client devices. We have seen this market behavior before and expect it to dissipate as the demand environment improves. Second, our exposure to larger deals. As we have deepened and broadened our strategic capabilities, including through the addition of Sirius, our ability to deliver large, full stack, full outcome projects has expanded, projects at the higher dollar tier that can be pushed for any number of reasons. This can drive year-over-year performance lumpiness and depending on the size and timing of decisions, impact results. Impact that is more acute during periods of low demand. You see this in commercial and federal this quarter where larger deals expected to close were deferred or reduced. And the third specific item pertains to our cloud and SaaS-based business. While we have grown this business significantly during the past several years, we have not yet achieved the scale we desire relative to our overall portfolio. As such, when demand for hardware softens, it has a more outsized impact on our financial results. I hope this perspective helps contextualize how CDW-specific dynamics amplified the impact of the low market demand environment and created a near-term growth challenge that we have not yet been able to overcome. These are not excuses. We own our results. So let's turn to what's important. What are we doing? As always, our continuous improvement in seller effectiveness is ongoing. This means delivering repeatable solutions and further streamlining the sales processes to maximize sales professional productivity. I'd like to highlight three additional focus areas. First, we are organically and inorganically growing our capabilities in the fastest growth, highest relevance cloud and software vectors to increase scale in both our services and as-a-service offerings. This will deliver greater choice and value to our customers and lead to greater recurring and reoccurring revenue streams. Second, we are further driving exceptional and differentiated customer experience in our core business. We are aligning our digital capabilities to serve customers in the way they want to plan, buy, consume and manage technology. And finally, we are enhancing our agility and accelerating pipeline growth. We are building on our customer growth engine by opening new lanes with both existing and new customers, and we are deepening our technical and industry expertise across all end markets. We know more than anything, customers value our unbiased highly informed point of view, a point of view that enables our ability to architect and implement full stack multi-branded solutions, which cut through the noise and deliver the outcomes our customers need. These are not new efforts, but we have ramped up intensity. Work is underway and progress is on track. Some actions will have fairly immediate impact and some will take more time to produce results. In the meantime, we remain laser-focused on finding pools of profitable growth and converting sales with rigor and speed. Now let's take a deeper look at quarterly results. Third quarter corporate net sales decreased 4% as sales cycles further elongated, most notably for large infrastructure investments. netcomm storage and servers all declined by significant double digits. We helped customers with client refresh, driving growth of high single digits. ASPs remained strong as customers' preference continued to drive higher-end devices. Cloud solutions was a priority and gross profit from cloud increased by double digits. Small business continued to bounce along the bottom with net sales down 2%. Cloud solutions remained strong given their low upfront commitment and customers continue to sweat data center assets. Unlike other channels, client refresh continues to be pushed out as customers remain in a cash preservation mode. Security was strong as cyber threats increased for lower profile businesses. The team's success delivering services drove strong double-digit growth in both professional and managed services. Public performance was less than seasonal and sales decreased 5% year-over-year. Health care was a bright spot in the quarter, delivering top line growth of 3%. The team continued its success helping health systems adopt managed services and cloud solutions to better control expenses, and they delivered strong double-digit growth in services and cloud spend. Similar to corporate, netcomm storage and servers all declined meaningfully. Client was strong, up double digits for the second quarter in a row. Government declined 12% with both state and local and federal government performance below seasonal in the quarter. Market conditions were challenging for the federal team. Demand impact was felt most acutely in large hardware solutions deals with federal posting double-digit declines in both netcomm and servers. Several agencies moved ahead with refresh and for the third quarter in a row, client devices increased by double digits. Cloud Solutions posted a double-digit increase in cloud gross profit. State and local sales declined by low double digits. Delays due to increased scrutiny and multiple approvals impacted large infrastructure hardware deals with netcomm storage and servers all posting significant declines. Security remained a top priority, posting a strong double-digit increase in gross profit. Services performance was strong, up high double digits, driven by professional services. Education sales declined 5%. Higher ed's top line declined high single digits. Client devices were flat and slow project materialization and budget constraints and cutbacks at some public universities contributed to double-digit declines in netcomms and servers. The team's success helping institutions implement cloud solutions to drive cost elasticity delivered double-digit growth in cloud spend and gross profit. K-12 net sales declined by low single digits, largely driven by declines in audiovisual and netcomm as school systems digested investments made over the past few years. The team continued to help refresh aging Chromebooks and delivered high teens client device growth. Cloud delivered double-digit gross profit growth. Services adoption was also up double digits, driven by our managed client device life cycle solution, which streamlines the configuration, deployment, management and a refresh process so school systems can focus on what really matters, their students. Other, our combined U.K. and Canada business performed above our expectations, up 5%. Both markets experienced stronger demand, albeit off depressed results in the prior year and prior quarter. Both the U.K. and Canada increased by similar amounts in local currency. As you can see, end market performance was mixed during the quarter. Let's take a look at how this translated to category performance. Portfolio performance reflected our ability to meet customers where and how they want it with client device, cloud and software and services growth, growth that was more than offset by hardware solutions decline. A low single-digit increase in transactions was more than offset by solution sales decreases of double digits. Hardware decreased 7%. High single-digit client device growth was more than offset by declines in netcomm storage and servers. Software increased 3.5% with healthy gross profit growth. Cloud was an important driver of this performance, up double digits in gross profit. Services increased by 13%, driven by managed services and warranties. As you can see, while demand varied, the diversity and completeness of our portfolio enables us to meet our customers where and how they need us. And that brings us to our expectations for the rest of the year. Given current conditions, we do not anticipate market demand to improve for the balance of the year, and we now look for the U.S. IT market to be roughly flat with 2023. We expect our results to continue to reflect the market and CDW-specific dynamics I referenced with gross profit growth challenged, given our mix of hardware and the pronounced cyclicality the market is experiencing. As we always do, we will provide our view on 2025 market conditions in our next call. There's no denying that we are operating in a tough environment, but we are confident that growth will return. The demand drivers are there, workload expansion and data explosion, increased security threats, client device obsolescence and adoption of AI-powered assistance and applications. And when demand picks up, we will be there to profitably capture these opportunities. In the meantime, we are doubling our efforts to drive profitable growth. While this past year has been challenging for us, it has also been challenging for our customers. As they're a trusted adviser, customers need us now more than ever. Our relationships are bolstered by our commitment to deliver value to our customers regardless of the demand environment. Now let me turn it over to Al, who will provide more detail on our financials and outlook. Yeah. And Adam, I would just add that we're being very prudent as we look at where we rightsize the business while we continue to invest behind areas that we see will be pockets of growth. So a lot of focus on the demand environment, preserving profitability and also delivering exceptional customer experience for our teams. Yes, Adam, it's a little of both. It's a little of both. Yeah. Let me just start with the market share. That was the beginning of the question. Look, we continue to hold ourselves accountable for delivering a premium to the IT market rate of growth. And looking at this year and this quarter, given the low hardware demand and taking into account our mix, I'd say we're holding serve and feeling very confident that we've performed extremely well in certain areas, take cloud, Software as a Service, services as an example, but other areas have been challenged for us. And our view is that hardware will come back. It's a matter of when will that inflection point take place, and we'll be well positioned to help our customers in those circumstances. You asked specifically about networking and storage. Look, what we are seeing is we're seeing traction in clients pick up. And I wouldn't yet call it the inflection point, but we do think we're outperforming in that area. Data center has really been the area where customers have paused, have moved spend to the cloud and are taking longer time to make decisions. That means we're seeing storage, networking and servers all quite muted. But once we see the client refresh start, one would expect to see data center begin to pick up again. As I said before, the catalysts are all there. Explosion in data, the need for massive bandwidth for networking, digital transformation isn't going anywhere. Security continues to get more and more focused. So the catalysts for growth are all there. I think we just got to get to the other side of the uncertainty that we sit. And certainly, after we get through the election, there'll be a little more certainty. Yeah. I think about the things that are creating the current environment and whether or not those change. So uncertainty around the economic environment and geopolitical will have an impact. Obviously, the election policy outcomes of the election are going to be very different. That will have an impact most likely. Those are the things that are at the forefront of our mind, how the economy is doing, frankly, how it's perceived to be doing, going to be doing in the future and the volatility across the world are the two things that we look at most closely. Now the complexity in IT is not going anywhere. So the requirement now to have more business and IT leaders involved in decision-making. It's our new norm is kind of longer decision cycles for these larger complex projects. And so we're getting used to that, but we don't see that going away anytime soon. That's what we focus on. Yeah, sure. I would say it is the broader market view, possibly tempered a bit by CDW not racing to the bottom because we are walking away from economic deals. It's important to keep - protect profitability, et cetera. So I would say it's a bit of both. I would say it is market and consistent with market, but also we are not racing to the bottom. Yeah. It's a great question, and we do reflect on that. We are used to highly competitive environment. What I would say we're feeling right now and this quarter and the past couple of quarters, in particular, is irrational pricing. And we know how to compete in the market, but we are seeing deals at below margin, low margin, et cetera, and that just is not our business model. The last time I saw intensity in pricing like this was years ago. So it has been a little bit more unique over the last couple of quarters, and we're very good with our discipline around financials. So we're holding firm. That's really the answer here. It's a little unique over the last couple of quarters. We've seen it really tick up. I would say it's up and down the value chain. So competitors who are value-added resellers, direct competitors, distributors, I wouldn't perceive as in that chain as much. Yes, the behaviors that are going on, every competitor is feeling the elongation in the sales cycle. The chunking up agreements to make them smaller, the deferrals, the reductions, the different ways they want to go at saving money or deferring spending, short-term ROIs. That is a market dynamic right now that everybody is feeling. Yeah, Amit, fair question. I'll tell you, we're a company in transformation, and we have been in transformation for several years now. So when you think about the CDW - CDW-specific factors I mentioned, they have been having a real impact on results, amplified by the muted hardware demand environment. So if we just think about the third one I mentioned, which is our cloud and SaaS business, we've been investing behind that business and growing it incredibly rapidly over the last 5 years. All of our acquisitions have had a cloud services hook to them. Nonetheless, given the full portfolio that we have, we have not yet attained the scale that we want to be at relative to the full portfolio. So when hardware is muted, it now has even more of an outsized impact because of the secular movement towards cloud. And we're growing that, but we still have a very high mix of hardware. The other thing is the strategic investments that we've made over the year have been incredibly fruitful in developing broader and deeper strategic capabilities so that we can deliver full stack, full outcomes projects. These now we're seeing at much larger, higher dollar tier levels, and those are the kind of projects that are lumpy. We used to talk about this with our federal contracts all the time. The very big deals become lumpier. And depending on when decisions are made, they can get deferred, they can move around, the size can change, and therefore, it can impact results. And we saw that with commercial and federal this quarter. And the last one is what I just talked about in the prior question, which is our financial discipline. We're going to continue to maintain our gross margin discipline as we move forward. And we've hit a couple of quarters where we're seeing behavior that is extreme - pricing behavior that's extreme. So I just - Amit, I'd say it is a combination of our strategic investments that are working incredibly well vis-a\u0300-vis value to the customer and growth in fast-growing high-relevance areas in an environment where hardware has been and continues to be muted on a persistent basis. It's a bit of a double whammy for us. But I'm confident in the growth as hardware turns around. Go ahead, Amit. No, I was just going to say... Go Amit. Yeah. As I think about the changes, I think about investing behind our cloud business and really the cloud flywheel where we are trying to - we are delivering a seamless experience from professional managed services to consumption and transaction-based services to managed services around the cloud. And by doing that, delivering higher value to our customers, but that's precisely aligned with what our vendors are the CSPs, the Ciscos of the world exactly aligned with what they - what they're incenting and what they want. So we think we're well positioned, and that will be a positive benefit for us as we move into 2025 and beyond because it aligns with our strategy and our value that we can deliver to customers. And frankly, it drives - because of the services wraparound, it drives better economics for CDW and a stickier relationship with the customer. Yeah, Matt, thanks for the question. On the client side, we're actually seeing - we're seeing growth across almost all of the end markets. Corporate was - we saw growth in corporate. It small business is where we are seeing our customers kind of in a cash preservation mode and so pushing off the client device. But we really have seen a nice pickup in client across almost all the end markets. So that's been positive. So next year, as AI PCs do come on board, that will be another nice accelerant for PC refresh. I would say that when you look at our portfolio and the spectrum of our relationships with our customers, that over 90% of those relationships and those customers would tell you that they buy from CDW because of the value we deliver, the access to a full portfolio, the expertise that we bring to bear, the ease with which they can do business, the agility with which we deliver that is what every customer says to me when I meet with them. Regarding the pricing and the transaction issues, there are times when there are large rollouts, for example, that - where the economics just gets lower and lower and lower. And those are transaction purchases that don't typically have the value wrapped around, and those are the ones that we are less interested in pursuing. I didn't hear the whole question. I'm sorry. Yeah. The way I'd answer that question is kind of yes and yes. In other words, we do have actions underway. Look, we're looking at this quarter in 2025 as an opportunity to accelerate the most important parts of our strategy that we've been working on for several years. But one of them, for example, would be our digital work. We've done a lot of foundational work in digital, and we just need to go faster. And that really means aligning our digital capabilities and our people to deliver personalized recommendations that match how customers want to buy, plan, consume and manage their assets. So think about this in terms of large deals and perhaps smaller deals as an intersection of our sales professionals moving up a value chain and being available to learn and enabled by digital tools to sell at the highest point of the value chain while creating a seamless digital experience for our customers, a flywheel, if you will, so that we can deliver both velocity in that digital flywheel and serve customers how they'd like to be served, self-serve, et cetera, and value with our account managers and sales professionals working together. So that's one area, as an example, where we - our intention is to drive velocity in deals at all sizes, lower-tier levels while we continue to build engagements at high value, high levels. Yeah, hard to tell. I would say this election cycle, I wouldn't - I would say there's nothing really normal about it. So hard to tell. I mean, right now, what's happening with the federal government is we've got the knock-on effects from the delayed budget previously. And now we've got - while we saw strong spending in the Department of Defense, we're seeing less than we'd hoped because they're waiting to see what the administration's priorities are. So we - right now, we just see the federal government paused. One would hope we'll have some more clarity post election, but then the timing comes down to Congress and the President in getting a budget passed. Okay. Thank you, operator. Let me close by recognizing the incredible dedication and hard work of our 15,000 coworkers around the globe. It's their ongoing commitment to our customers in this challenging environment that makes us successful over the long term. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals, and thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our third quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our updated 2024 outlook. Third quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion was down 2.2% versus the prior year. This was below our original expectations of low single-digit growth as strength in cloud and client devices across most channels was offset by lower demand for solutions hardware. Gross margin of 21.8% was flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and broadly in line with both full year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024. Third quarter margin was aided by a higher mix into sales or CDW act as agent, also known as netted down revenues. This category grew by 7.1% on a reported basis, once again outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 35.7% of our gross profit compared to 32.6% in the prior year third quarter. Year-over-year expansion came from our teams continuing to successfully serve customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. This led to our highest quarterly netted down revenues we've seen as a company as we met customers where they needed us most. The netted down category of solutions continues to represent an important and durable trend within our business. Third quarter gross profit was up 1.5% sequentially compared to the second quarter of 2024 on a reported basis. Net sales were up 1.7% sequentially as well. Higher year-over-year demand in the health care and international channels alongside a sequential increase in government drove growth over the second quarter. However, this growth is below both historic seasonal levels and our own expectations as the firmer footing in the corporate space that we saw at the end of the second quarter did not persist through the later months of the third quarter. We experienced deals getting pushed out and downsized as customers deliberate on where and when to spend and primarily in the solutions space. While international outpaced the U.S. business in the third quarter, we still expect volatility in this space as customers face economic and political uncertainty. Overall, we're competing in a challenging low-growth environment, and we are focused on achieving profitable growth. We acknowledge that we have work to do to better calibrate market conditions and deliver on our own expectations. Turning to expenses for the second [ph] quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $667 million, down 0.7% year-over-year. Expenses were down year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and the efficiency ratio of non-GAAP SG&A to gross profit of 55.5% was relatively in line with our expectations. We continue to look to align our cost structure with demand and have taken actions early in the fourth quarter to better align expenses to market conditions. Coworker count at the end of the third quarter was approximately 15,400, up slightly over the second quarter and modestly above year-end. Customer-facing coworker count was also up slightly at approximately 11,200. Our goal is to balance growth and exceptional customer experience with greater efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $534 million, down 4% versus the prior year, driven by our volume shortfall, offset by slightly lower expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.7% was down from 9.9% in the prior year, but up from 9.4% in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP net income of $355 million in the quarter, down 3.9% on a year-over-year basis. With third quarter weighted average diluted shares of 134.9 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.63. Moving ahead to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $4.9 billion. Net debt is down $91 million from the second quarter and has decreased by approximately $184 million since year-end 2023. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 2030 senior notes and $600 million of 2034 senior notes. We issued the combined $1.2 billion to settle the tender offers of both the 2024 and 2025 senior notes and for general corporate purposes that will maximize strategic flexibility. Since Q3 end, we have fully redeemed the 2024 notes. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.2 billion. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, up 2 days from the prior year and at the lower end of our targeted range of high teens to low 20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including active management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted free cash flow was $261 million in the quarter, roughly consistent with our expectations. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $764 million and 80% of our non-GAAP net income within our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90% of non-GAAP net income. We are on track to meet our 2024 objectives. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $100 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with our non-GAAP net income growth. We're announcing an approximate 1% increase of our dividend to $2.50 annually, our 11th consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to prudently manage our dividend with respect to the growth environment and target a roughly 25% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward. Our second priority is to have the right capital structure in place. We ended the third quarter at 2.3 times net leverage within our targeted range of 2 to 3 times. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility as evidenced by our recent debt financings. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate opportunities that could accelerate our 3-part strategy for growth. Year-to-date, we've utilized over $350 million of cash on share repurchases and have over $730 million of authorization remaining under our current share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023 have persisted well into 2024. Demand has been below what we originally anticipated and customer sentiment remains cautious across the majority of end markets. Last quarter, we spoke about the slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending and shared our expectations for tough conditions to persist in the near term. That was the case and was moderately worse than we even expected in the third quarter. Customers still have a compelling need to address priorities such as cloud workload growth, increasing security threats, aging client devices, but uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape continue to weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware. Given these conditions, our updated 2024 expectation is for a low single digit gross profit decline. This implies seasonality slightly below historical levels for the fourth quarter and second half gross profit and net sales. We maintain our expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full year 2023 and much like we've seen year-to-date in 2024. Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be down mid single digits year-over-year. Please remember, we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Moving to modeling thoughts for the fourth quarter. We anticipate low to mid single-digit gross profit declines compared to the prior year, with gross margins slightly above the first three quarters of 2024, but below the fourth quarter 2023 level. This leads to a slightly worse than seasonal sequential fourth quarter. Traditionally, the fourth quarter is meaningfully lower than the third quarter, principally due to seasonally lower demand from education and government customers. But this first fourth quarter, we also do not anticipate this being offset by seasonally strong demand from corporate and small business customers. Moving down the P&L. We expect fourth quarter operating expenses to be similar to the level of fourth quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis. Finally, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to decline in the high single-digit range year-over-year. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it for questions. We'd ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow up. Thank you. Yeah, Adam, actually, this is Al. I will start just to give you a little bit of commentary on the quarter and operating leverage, and I'll let Chris jump in thereafter. So first - on the quarter, first, I would just say, Adam, we continue to hold strongly to our variable cost model and the impact therein. For the quarter, if you actually look at our non-GAAP SG&A expenses relative to GP, we came in just about at that 55% range, which we've talked about that being kind of the target that we would have. It's maybe slightly higher than we would have anticipated for the quarter, but that was more of a, I'll call it, denominator factor that is the GP was lower than expected. So in the quarter, we did get the movement in our variable expenses as we would expect. I think the challenge there otherwise, Adam, is that we have a fixed cost base. And while the demand environment has moved pretty dramatically, we certainly have taken action on our fixed cost to try to align with what we were seeing in current demand and what we were seeing as we go forward, it becomes a matter of just the timing therein on that fixed cost base. That said, as you know, going into the fourth quarter, we did take some actions that would reduce our fixed cost base, and that included a reduction in our workforce. Just to size that for you, Adam, it was about 2% of our workforce. So it was not at the level that you quoted there. But certainly, that would align us more closely with where we think we need to be from a fixed cost base perspective. And David, maybe I'll just add there. It's okay. Just to add a couple of data points there. So obviously, all of those categories, Chris mentioned in the solutions space have been softer. We also have the tough comps from a netcomm perspective. Q3 is the last quarter with those tough comps. So while we would not say that demand is picking up meaningfully on netcomm, at least the comps get a bit easier. And then the other data point I would just give you is from our vantage point, just hardware overall, we've now seen eight quarters of declines on hardware. And so again, Chris noted some of the catalysts we think ultimately will play out. We've seen a pretty prolonged period of hardware cyclicality. Thank you. Yeah. And Matt, I'll just add the - what has been driving it has been more refresh of aging fleets and need for customers to get on with this activity. It's been less in the way of Win 11 drivers and less in the way of AI PCs. Yeah. Great question, Matt. It anticipates that we'll continue to see softness in the solutions side of the business, which comes at moderately higher gross margins. It assumes that client will continue to tick along, not in an outsized way, but that client would continue to move along. And then we would expect that we would get your typical pickup in more of the netted down revenues in the fourth quarter. I'll just note the delta versus Q4 of 2023 is that maybe a little bit modest pick there on the netted down revenues versus last year because it was quite outsized at the end of the year. You're welcome. I think I got it, Keith. Here's what I would say. Obviously, we've seen pronounced cyclicality in hardware, and that would typically be pretty significant upfront spend. Think about that as kind of CapEx from a customer's perspective. What we've seen kind of counteracting that in some respects is an increase in our netted down revenues, including SaaS and cloud. Now Keith, historically, a lot of that business would be what we would call reoccurring where we are both seeing that business upfront and recognizing that upfront. But I would say that over the last year or 2, more of that business has been moving to a recurring nature. And that is where customers are more making judgments on what they want to spend on cloud, but they're consuming it as they go. And therefore, that shows up over time for us. Now I wouldn't call that a material dollar amount at this point, but it is growing. And therefore, I would say that is part of the calculus of kind of the air pocket when you have pronounced cyclicality of hardware and more business that starts to come on as we go. Certainly, as we continue to grow that sector in that category, we'll report more on kind of that split in details with respect to reoccurring business versus recurring. Hopefully, that's helpful. And maybe, Samik, I'll just add on the back end there. Obviously, we play all of the different scenarios and how things could play out when we look at the quarterly outlooks. I would say our Q4 outlook has the appropriate level of caution baked into it based on all the factors that we've talked about, the external factors, TDW specific, and certainly, that would include any political uncertainty. Thank you."

With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Leahy: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and view on the second half of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Second quarter market dynamics played out roughly as we expected. Cautious customer behavior once again, elongated sales cycles and drove prioritization of needs over wants and cost savings over expansion. Capital investment in complex solutions, particularly those tied to data center and network modernization continued to be downsized or put on hold, and there was growing refresh activity in client devices. What was not expected were two end-market specific dynamics, a worsening in the UK environment and further federal funding challenges. Within the limited demand environment, we continue to help our customers build out technology roadmaps and our pipeline remains solid in the solution space. Conversion remains challenging with uncertainty weighing on our customers' appetite to spend. The team's value as a trusted adviser and ability to deliver solutions that met our customers' most pressing priorities drove excellent performance across cloud, security and services. Performance that contributed to strong profitability and cash flow, performance made possible by the strategic investments we have made over the past five years to bring full stack, full lifecycle solutions to our customers. For the quarter, the team delivered gross profit of $1.2 billion, flat year-over-year with a gross margin of 21.8%, up 80 basis points, net sales of $5.4 billion, which were down 3.6%, non-GAAP operating income of $510 million, down 3.7% with a non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.4%, which was flat and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50, which was down 2.6%. Let's take a look at this quarter's performance drivers. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Recall, we have five sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education, each a meaningful business on its own with 2023 annual sales ranging from $1.6 billion to $9 billion. Channels are further segmented to focus on customer end markets including geography, verticals, customer size and spend. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.6 billion dollars in 2023 sales. These unique customer end markets are typically uncorrelated given the different economic and external factors that impact each of them. Our second quarter results provide a good example of this. Corporate posted a net sales decline of 2%. Robust increases in cloud and security supported profitability with a meaningful increase in gross margin. Client devices increased for the second quarter in a row and posted both year-over-year and sequential sales increases of low double digits. Notably, client device ASPs held firm with a mix into higher value, higher functionality units. Once again, servers and netcomm declined as customers continue to undergo technology transitions in its real capacity. Storage was a standout category increasing double digit driven by upgrades of legacy systems. Small business net sales declined 3%. The team's ability to help customers address mission critical priorities around security and productivity with cost-effective software and cloud solutions contributed to improvements in both gross profit and margin. Small business did not see significant refresh activity and while increasing mid-single digit sequentially, client devices declined slightly year-over-year in the quarter. Consistent with corporate ongoing postponement of infrastructure investments in netcomm and servers drove low double-digit declines. Public sales declined 2% in the quarter with mixed performance by end market. Government decreased 6% as growth in state and local was more than offset by a decline in federal. Federal results were further impacted by the delayed fiscal 2024 budget authorization as several key customers did not receive funding releases until late June, weeks later than expected. These released funds face processing delays from the normal gears of government as hardware and software orders require solicitation, competitive bids and evaluation. We know that ongoing projects will eventually move forward, but some agencies may pause new projects as they await the clarity around the next administration's priority. In light of these layers of friction and uncertainty, we do not expect a federal catch up in the back half of 2024. The state and local team had another solid quarter, up mid-single digits. Security remained a key performance driver. Client devices increased by mid-single digits both year-over-year and sequentially. While early state and local budget dollars are being allocated to improving citizens experience at state and municipal agencies, including enhanced AI-powered automated response and messaging platforms. Healthcare net sales were flat. Security remained a key focus area and the team delivered robust customer spend and gross profit growth, led by security assessments for cloud migration and identity management. Driven by refresh, client devices increased by double digits. The team's ability to deliver cloud migration, including moving applications out of hospital data centers, drove excellent cloud performance and contributed to both increased gross margin and profitability. Education sales declined roughly 1%. K-12's top line was roughly flat year-over-year while profitability grew. For the second quarter in a row, client device sales increased up mid-single digits as school systems refreshed aged Chromebooks. Security and cloud remain top priorities, both delivering strong growth and gross profit. Once again, collaboration hardware, primarily smart whiteboards and interactive flat panels, declined meaningfully as schools continue to digest significant purchases made over the past several years. With the sunsetting of ETF funds and upcoming deadlines for ESSER funds of September 30th, the team is focused on helping their customers pivot to refresh programs funded through traditional mechanisms. Consistent with recent quarters, higher ed institutions remained focused on investments to enhance student experience to drive enrollment, while doing more with less, and the team posted a mid-single-digit top-line decline. Cost elasticity continued to drive strong double-digit growth in cloud. Security remained a top priority, up strong double digits and client devices returned to growth in the quarter, up high single digits driven by refresh. Our UK and Canadian international operations, which we reported other, declined 13%. While both teams continue to execute well, the demand environment, particularly in the UK, worsened during the quarter as the early general election amplified already challenging conditions. UK sales declined high teens in US dollars and Canada declined 4% in US dollars. Given current conditions, we expect the UK market to remain volatile and under pressure through the back half of the year. As you can see, the diversity of our end markets results is fundamental to the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Category performance demonstrates the benefit of our second performance driver, our broad and deep portfolio of products and solutions. Transactions categories increased during the quarter while solutions categories declined. Both transactions and solutions increased sequentially in the quarter. At the portfolio level, hardware decreased 5%. High single-digit client device growth and mid-single-digit steward growth was more than offset by meaningful declines in netcomm and collaboration. Software customer spend increased mid-single digits while net sales were impacted by our strong mix into netted down revenue and decreased by 1%. Services increased by 6% driven by cloud and security-related services. Once again, cloud was an important performance driver, contributing double-digit gross profit growth across software, services and security. Profitable growth that was enabled by the strategic investments, both organic and acquired, we have made in solutions and services capabilities over the past five years. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, our three-part strategy for growth, which is; first, acquired new customers and capture share; second, enhanced our solution of capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage the solutions our customers want and need in any environment. Let me share an example of our strategy and action as we delivered on a customer's priority in today's challenging demand environment. An insurance company faced early end of life for its hyperconverged infrastructure equipment, something not contemplated in their already tight budget. Armed with our broad and deep cloud portfolio, our cloud, hybrid infrastructure and services group collaborated to architect a cloud subscription-based solution that delivered cost elasticity, the customer's budget could absorb. The multi-faceted solution seamlessly moved on-premise workloads and data to the public cloud, delivered cloud compute, migrated custom and off-the-shelf applications, created a virtual desktop infrastructure and delivered security measures with virtual firewalls. Plus, it optimized workloads to ensure the customer effectively managed CPU usage, memory and storage, further mitigating costs. This comprehensive solution generated more than $1 million in product revenue and a multi-million dollar CDW professional services engagement. After seeing our cloud expertise in action, the customer engaged us for additional cloud solutions, including identity management and unified cloud call center ongoing managed services. Today, we were one of the customers' most valued strategic partners. A great example of how we're delivering value to our customers both for today and for the future. And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. You will recall that on the last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2024 U.S. IT market growth in the low single digits. And our target to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market. This factored in a modest improvement in demand conditions in the second half of the year. Given real-time feedback from our large and diverse customer base, we now expect current market conditions to persist throughout the year, not get worse, but not get better. Given the market's slow start to the year, without a second-half demand pickup, we now look for U.S. IT market growth up towards the lower end of a low single-digit range. We continue to maintain our target to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market. Growth will return. The demand drivers are there. Workload and data growth, increased security threats, client device obsolescence, and adoption of AI-powered assistance and applications. But customers need greater clarity and confidence, clarity around economic conditions and clarity around the impact of AI on their tech roadmap, and confidence that investments made today will deliver the right foundations and economic returns in an AI-powered future. Improved demand conditions are a function of when, not if. Wildcards for the balance of 2024 include the potential of greater macro and geopolitical uncertainty, significant degradation of market conditions in the UK, as well as unusual uncertainty in the U.S. election. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions as we move through the year. Whatever the market conditions, we will remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers, gaining share and executing with the discipline and rigor that is CDW's hallmark. And we will continue to play the long game, holding steadfast in our commitment to executing against our growth strategy to ensure we have the solutions and services capabilities our customers need to achieve their mission critical outcomes. With that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance.\nAl Miralles: Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our Q2 performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our updated 2024 outlook. Second quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion is roughly flat, up 0.1% versus the prior year. This is modestly below our original expectations for low single-digit growth for the quarter as the aforementioned strength in cloud, security and services was offset by lower demand for netcomm and collaboration hardware. Consolidated second quarter net sales of $5.4 billion were down 3.6% versus the prior year on both reported and average daily sales basis and up 11.3% sequentially, driven by seasonally higher demand in education channels and government channels and especially pursuant to client devices. Gross margin increased approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin of 21.8% was flat quarter-over-quarter and broadly in line with both full-year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024. Second quarter year-over-year margin expansion was primarily driven by the higher mix in the sales, where CDW acts as agent, also known as netted down sales. This category grew by 8.7%, once again, outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 33.2% of our gross profit, compared to 30.6% in the prior year's second quarter. Year-over-year expansion came from our teams continuing to successfully serve customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. The netted down category of solutions represents an important and durable trend within our business, contributing to our ability to deliver enhanced gross margins. It is important to note that netted down sales growth and its impact on our mix of business will fluctuate over time with customer priorities and product demand. Second quarter gross profit was up 11.3%, compared to the first quarter of 2024 on both reported and sequential average daily sales basis. While second quarter sequential net sales and gross profit growth were higher than the sequential growth rate seen in the last few years, they were very modestly behind our own expectations, as well as historical seasonal upturn we experienced in pre-pandemic years. This reflected two factors, longer-than-expected delays in spend from our federal customers related to the prior congressional budget impasse and lower performance by our UK business, which is impacted by volatility in the economic and political climate. Turning to expenses for the second quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $673 million, up 3.2% year-over-year. Expenses were roughly consistent with the expectation we shared on our last earnings call, including expense efficiency ratio more in line with normal levels. The improvement from the first quarter reflected higher gross profit attainment and relatively lower level expenses on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was approximately 15,200, up slightly over the first quarter and year-end. Customer facing coworker count was also slightly up at approximately 11,000. Our goal is to balance driving growth and exceptional customer experience with efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $510 million, down 3.7% versus the prior year, driven by the combination of roughly flat gross profit and moderately higher expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.4% was flat to the prior year and up from 8.3% in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $339 million in the quarter, down 2.9% on a year-over-year basis. The second quarter weighted average diluted shares of 135.6 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.50. Moving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $5 billion. Net debt has declined by approximately $93 million since year-end 2023, primarily reflecting our increased cash position alongside modest debt repayment. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.9 billion. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, up three days from the prior year, but still at the lower end of our targeted range of high-teens to low-20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including active management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted free cash flow was $138.4 million in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and seasonal business trends. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $503 million, an 84% of non-GAAP net income within our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90%. First-half performance puts us on track to meet our 2024 objectives. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $202 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio in 2024. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We ended the second quarter at 2.4 times within our targeted net leverage range of two to three times. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our three-part strategy for growth. Year-to-date, we've utilized over $250 million of cash on share repurchases and have over $830 million remaining under our current share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023 have persisted well into 2024. Customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent across end markets, particularly in the commercial, international and federal channels. Last quarter, we spoke about the slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending and shared our expectations for tough conditions to persist in the near-term, but to modestly improve in the second half. At the same time, we noted a compelling need for our customers to address cloud workload growth, increasing security threats and aging client devices. These priorities continue to resonate with customers and were brighter spots in the second quarter, while uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware. Given these market conditions, our updated full-year 2024 expectation is for flat-to-low single-digit gross profit growth, a view that incorporates both our slower start to the year and our view that the mild recovery we anticipated in the second half is not likely to materialize. This leads to seasonality roughly in line with historical levels, with the first half contributing approximately 48% of net sales and gross profit. We maintain our expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full-year 2023 and much like we've seen throughout the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be flat to up slightly year-over-year. Please remember we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. We anticipate low single-digit gross profit growth compared to the prior year with no change to our expectation that gross margin will be comparable to full-year 2023 and the first half of 2024. This leads to roughly normal seasonality, compared to historical levels and also the moderately lower second quarter base. We continue to expect the fourth quarter to be meaningfully lower, compared to the third quarter, principally due to seasonally lower demand from education and government customers. Moving down the P&L. We expect third quarter operating expenses to be moderately higher than the third quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis given the higher gross profit performance, but at a similar ratio relative to gross profit. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year. For full-year 2024, we are maintaining our expectation for adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income. We currently sit comfortably within that range. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Amit, your line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe, just to start with, if I look at your core gross margin, the gross profits excluding netted down revenues, it was up fairly, nicely, sequentially and really flat year-over-year despite what seems like a much higher mix of PCs in the quarter. Could you just talk about what is enabling the sequential gross margin expansion in June for your core business and if there's a structural change to what PC margins may look like going forward?\nAl Miralles: Yes. Thanks, Amit. Good morning. I'll take that question. Nothing too significant there to report, Amit. I would just say that, within the array of the product sectors, we did see strength in storage in a couple other categories that supplemented our client device margins. And then further, I would note that on the client device side of the house, we continue to see firm margins there including, and Chris alluded to this, kind of a higher mix in the kind of premium product, if you will. So, overall, we continue to see an environment, where product margins appear to be holding up. And obviously, as you pointed out, they are further supplemented by the growth that we continue to see on the netted down revenue stream side.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then, yes, I guess, Chris, could you just talk about, if I think about it at the start of the year, the expectation was for gross profit dollars to be up mid-single digits and it kind of went to low single digits and now, it's kind of flat to low. Is this downward revision that you made, is it really around what's happening to the PC recovery and how that's become a bigger part of the mix. Or are there other factors Let me see. How do you weigh the downtick in revisions over the last couple of quarters? And is there any change in how you forecast your forecasting philosophy as you go forward related to that? Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes. Good morning, Amit. Thanks for the question. As we think about, let me start with the first part of that question, the outlook, and I'll just walk you through. I mean, at high level, that our outlook, incorporated a modest uptick in the second half demand of 2024. And that change really reflects, that we think current market conditions will persist. I think, I said not get worse, excuse me, but not get better. And that's just based on our market intelligence with our customers and our frontline coworkers. If you want to go through the puts and takes, look, when we start with corporate after a long period of fits and starts, and what I'll call uneven performance, corporate feels on more solid footing and is demonstrating a steadier rhythm to the business. That said, with signs of stability, it's still a bit too early to call and to bake that into the expectation in the back half of the year. Just need to see a couple more data points to build confidence on that one. Small business, I'd say not getting worse, not quite as volatile, but still bouncing along the bottom, so not seeing an uptick there. And then we've got these two end markets that had very unique impacts and we think will impact going forward. The UK, the degradation in the UK that I mentioned in the environment there, which impacted the second quarter and expecting impact the second half of the year. And then the federal gears of government, these two delays are just creating, frankly, a bottleneck that's not overcomeable at this point, on the federal side. And so, we don't expect to see a pickup back in the second half of the year in federal as we expected to. So, I just say that the outlook net-net reflects that there's no substantive change in the commercial market demand. It incorporates normal seasonality and it also includes, I guess, a moderate IT refresh across primarily client devices and some other solutions that can't be postponed. So, that's the way that we're thinking about the outlook. I think you asked a question on forecasting. And I would just say that on the forecasting, look, the team is doing a phenomenal job staying highly-engaged with our customers and pivoting, when needed. As you can see from our results, security cloud, software services results, it's very clear that we -- our portfolio and our people allow us to be the trusted adviser and support in the moment in the market type solutions. The forecasting is, yes, it's a little bumpier. because you've got lumpy - lumpy-big deals and they're all interrelated. There's no the example that I shared during the script. You see how interrelated and complex the solutions are. So, as those push, they push. but I think the team's doing a great job staying engaged with customers. And I would also say that our solutions pipeline is really quite strong. It's been the conversion given the market that is reflecting the appetite to buy, but the pipeline is really quite strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Matt, your line is now open.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes. Thanks. Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the commentary regarding the continued slow demand for netcomm and servers, advanced solutions products. This is probably the third quarter that we're into that malaise. I know there was a lot of backlog that was worked down. Are you seeing any visibility of signs of pickup there. And then on the server side, we're hearing, particularly, SMBs and middle markets, where there's more an acceleration toward cloud instead of doing their own internal upgrade. So, any visibility into those markets?\nChris Leahy: Yes. I would say on the networking side, there's certainly interest from customers on network modernization. That is a high priority. but there is still significant digestion going on. The supply chain is normalized, but we still have customers that are digesting what they purchased or actually received, I should say, later in the cycle. I think as we get back to the back half of the year, the overlaps will look a little bit different and so the performance will likely look a little bit different. But I would just say it's high priority. There's just still a lot of excess at our customers that they're digesting. On the server side, on the mid-market server side, we are seeing some strength in that area. but again, it's subject to our customers really, being cautious about where they're spending and pivoting a little more to cloud and elastic advisable solutions at this time.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Thank you. And then regarding the outlook for the government business, it doesn't sound like there's going to be that seasonal uptick in federal, yet you're guiding the overall company for a seasonality in the next couple of quarters. So, are there any offsets to that weakness in federal.\nAl Miralles: Good morning, Matt. I would just note, look, we are still going to see reasonably normal seasonality from the government business. And remember, there's significant strength there on the state and local side of things. So look, even in the quarter, state and local offsetted some of that compression from a federal perspective. So, I would say it's all in the realm of regular normal seasonality for government, with just a downtick a bit in federal for Q3 and Q4.\nMatthew Sheerin: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Keith, your line is now open.\nKeith Housum: Great. Good morning. Just one question really. In terms of the CrowdStrike debacle that happened recently, was that a positive or negative for you guys in terms of working with your customers.\nChris Leahy: Oh, Keith. Thanks for the question. First of all, it was CDW didn't impact us that much, which was great. But I'll tell you, I'm really proud of this team. They were so quick to help customers do boot-refixes and workarounds and essentially, get after customers immediately. So, it just reinforced, I think, the fact that we have such strong relationships with our customers and that the trust adviser role is so important. Once you do a transaction with a customer, it's not one and done, but this just reflected the fact that the aftercare and the relationship ongoing is so important. So, it was a very unfortunate, obviously, circumstance across the world, but really proud of the team for stepping up and stepping in with our customers.\nKeith Housum: Yes. If I can follow-up on that, is that an opportunity for you guys to gain customers by showing exactly the experience and advisor leadership you guys have.\nChris Leahy: Oh, absolutely. Yes. So, in circumstances like this, when we have been able to help, when there's a particular issue that's popped up that absolutely goes back and across the sales organization, we take it to other customers to help highlight potential vulnerabilities and then help them resolve those.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Same in the security space. That's what we do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant of Citigroup.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for taking my question. If I could -- if you could just double click a little bit on the OpEx intensity, where is CDW spending these U.S. -- spending these operational expense dollars on. and how we should think about the trajectory of those expenses as it relates to your overall revenue or gross profit dollar growth in the back half. Thank you.\nAl Miralles: Sure. Good morning, Assia. A couple of things that I would just note. Number one, remember when we started the year, we indicated that we would have expected the beginning of the year would reflect higher level of expenses than usual and a ratio of SG&A relative to GP would ease as the year played out. Asiya, some of that is a function of just timing and seasonality of certain expenses that we see in the first half, some of it a function of our lower GP production -- gross profit production in the first half. And then just from a compare perspective, I would just note for you that, that last year obviously was a pretty uneven year, if you will. And pretty early in the year, we saw indications that our outlook was coming down. So that has an impact on the timing and our judgments with respect to things like compensation accruals. So, because of that, when you add it all together, our first half, we look a bit more shifting towards deleverage from an expense perspective. And what you should expect in the back half is that, that would ease, that would balance out obviously as our gross profit attainment would be higher. but also, you get a bit kind of a pickup from a seasonality timing of our expenses as well. So, for the full year, we expect it would look reasonably normal. The back half is going to look a lot different than it did in the first half vis-\u00e0-vis operating leverage.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. And if I may, just you've talked about a strong pipeline here for your customers. Help us understand how you think about that pipeline conversion to revenues. I understand it's the federal impact and the macro, and the UK. But if you could just as you think about more into, let's say, the next 12 months ahead post-calendar \u201824, how are you thinking about that pipeline conversion. And how would you think about CDW's trajectory of growth ahead. Thank you.\nChris Leahy: Yes. well, we think about the pipeline -- excuse me, we think about the pipeline, starting first, in terms of engagement with our customers and staying very close to our customers and doing and suggesting solutions that are best for them. In a market now, where cost optimization is high and needs are prioritized over once. A CDW is very careful to help our customers accommodate that, which might mean that not new and not growth revenue, but revenue that is finding cost optimization for them. All that said, what we do in an environment like this is we work hard to increase the pipeline to ensure that when it's time to convert, it's sufficient to drive growth. We do all the things that we do with a lot of rigor. We inspect the pipeline. We grow the pipeline. We measure the pipeline. We drive conversations with our customers. It's really just the appetite to convert at this point that we're not seeing. Now as I said, what has been very positive is the rhythm of the business feels, feels more stable, feels a little more firmer footing. and I think that's a good indicator of moving to more solid footing, which means a pipeline converting it in the not-too-distant future, which will convert into growth.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, the first question I'll ask to Al and it's another question on gross margins. When you look at the core business margins, ex-netted down items, looks like in fiscal 2Q that grew by 40 bps to about 15.7%. Can core business margins continue to grow for the remainder of the year? I guess, Al, my question is the gross profit for the year is lower, is that because the mix of netted down items is lower, or do you think the gross margin of the core business is also lower?\nAl Miralles: Sure. Thank you, Ruplu. Look, for the full year, we are calling for gross margins to look much like the first half did and frankly then much like 2023 in total. What you can expect there is continued durability and trending of our netted down revenues, which have been extremely strong. We would expect that would continue. And particularly, I'd say, in the year, we typically see more of that with renewals, of cloud and SaaS contracts et cetera. And that would be balanced with our regular mix of business, including expectation kind of a glide path of our client business. Now, on the non-netted down margins, I'll just note again, that product margins there have continued to help hold firm, and that's been quite a run, where they've been firm and we would expect that to continue. So, that's the sum of the different parts, Ruplu, to get us to that gross margin expectation very similar in the back half as what we saw in the first half.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the details there. Maybe, as a follow-up, can I ask, Chris, how are you thinking about AI related spend in 2024. Did you have any AI-related revenues in fiscal 2023 and how do you see the impact of that on hardware and also on your services revenues in the year? Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ruplu. I'd answer it this way. Look, we're really in the very early innings of AI monetization, and CDW is investing behind and doing well frankly. We're investing primarily in people and enablement, and doing well in the areas that are kind of early stage, which I would say, are consultative primarily at this point. AI certainly opens conversations with customers extensively. But I would say our opportunity, the massive opportunity for CDW is full stack over the long run, and I would call this a long a long game. look, it feels very much, and we've said this before that AI is like any other kind of transformative technology of the past. and it plays to CDW's strengths. Complexity and choice always make it more difficult for our customers, and that helps us bring our knowledge, expertise and portfolio to bear. So, as I think forward, we do see it as an accelerant. We're investing behind it. Our customers are still at the stage of what's the art of getting this done and how's the sign what's the science of doing it. It's just a matter, frankly, Ruplu, of what the time frame of growth looks like over the long term. but I feel confident that we'll play it every -- at every layer of the stack. And it will be embedded in every layer of the stack.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Wang of Barclays. George, your line is now open.\nGeorge Wang: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I just want to ask about AI, kind of wondering if you have a refresher thought in terms of potential uncertainty related to the AI, especially last quarter, you got called about right now, the CDW customers are still in the assessment, the experimentation stage. So, you have sort of air pocket, if you will, before so the ARRI is further validated. Just curious are you seeing a slightly different behavior right now with the customers as they sort of play into this elongation of sales cycle. Just wondering if you can give a little more thought on that compared to a quarter ago.\nChris Leahy: Yes. George, I would just -- I would reiterate that we're still seeing that AI has put the architectural roadmap for compute storage and networking under reevaluation and flux, and we're still seeing that play out this quarter. I actually expect that to last for some period of time as we help customers sort through again, what the art of the possibilities. but then what's the actual return on investment dollars.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. Yes. Just a quick follow-up, if I can. Just CDW has pretty good reputation of share gains through the cycle, especially in the fragmented box space. Just curious, are you seeing additional evidence, especially given, sluggish macro, but you're probably seeing the overall, so the four-stack solutions Are you seeing sort of a stronger pickup in sort of a kind of fragmented shed kind of just maybe, you can talk about competition and the kind of the areas CDW is. So, we're doing much better versus the rest of the field.\nChris Leahy: Sure, George. I would just say that we feel very confident that we continue to gain share in this low demand and limited demand market across virtually every category. You saw our results for security and for services, and cloud, client device refresh is starting to pick up. And this is validated both by, obviously, our own data, but equally our partner reviews. our partners validate that we are indeed taking shares that we're feeling very good about, where we're positioned in a limited growth environment.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. I'll go back to the queue.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Samik, your line is now open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe, Chris, if I could just start with the areas of strength that you're seeing from product perspective. And I think storage, you sort of highlighted that as an area of strength. And not going into every specific category, but in terms of the areas that you're seeing refreshes on, just how do you feel about sustainability of that base. Because it does sound a bit more contrast to when you say customers are not really looking to spend as much and there's sort of a stable environment that there would be sort of a longer-term sustainability of the areas of strength that you're seeing at the same time. Just can you help us think about what is giving you visibility on that front. And I have a follow-up.\nChris Leahy: Yes. Sure. So, I'd say look, capital investment and complex solutions, especially those tied to data center and network modernization are the ones that I highlighted as areas of more caution right now, given the uncertainty and also the increasingly complex technology landscape. Compute, we did see some pickup. That's really because, it was put off for some quite some time by a number of customers. and so there was a need to upgrade for against legacy systems. And then on the client side, as I said, we started to see, what we think is the beginnings of a refresh. Obviously, given all the catalyst there, that's going to be sustainable. The aged devices, Win 11, AI PCs, et cetera. We expect that to be a real refresh. And then I say sustainability in the clouds, where you saw strength this quarter in particular, cloud security and services in particular, I don't see those slowing down anytime soon. They're a great opportunity to offset some of those capital investments. They're a great opportunity for cost optimization and optimization generally. So, our customers have turned to them and with our portfolio, the beautiful thing about our is whatever our customers are buying, whenever they're buying it, we can give them the solution they need. So, very well prepared to deliver today and as we start to see a recovery in the capital investment appetite.\nSamik Chatterjee: And for my follow-up, I know you mentioned the netted down revenue mix every quarter. but anything further that you can give us in terms of how to best think about that sort of part of the portfolio, how much of that is security versus some other sort of software, just to be able to sort of more closely sort of correlate with what we're seeing from the peers and how should we really be thinking about which part of sort of software is it more correlated to.\nAl Miralles: Sure, Samik. I'll take it. This is Al. So, just reminder what categories fall into netted down. You have software assurance. You have warranty. You have SaaS. You have cloud. Right. So, the big components, if you will. The strength that we've seen obviously has been substantially in the SaaS and cloud space. and that runs the gamut in terms of underlying workloads in those categories. Right That includes data, virtualization software, networking to some degree. So, it runs the gamut in those categories. They've been the leaders in that space. I should note, Samik, there, with that over the last year, categories such as software assurance and warranty obviously have lagged. because they are substantially attached to products, hardware and software -- licensed software that is. And so they've been laggards, which at some point as we talk about the catalyst and things beginning to turn from a hardware perspective, you could see some of those categories pick up. But in the meantime, as we are now saying, Hannah, we think that recovery is going to take a little bit more time, the most durable trends are in the SaaS and cloud space.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Adam, your line is now open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Al, I wanted to start on guidance. I know, I asked you last quarter on this and some of the explanation was for Q2 was that your modeling is below seasonal. It was off of a weak Q1 and that it seemed like this was sort of a conservative guidance estimate for Q2. and here we are this morning with effectively a miss. That's kind of become a pattern here a couple of quarters now below expectations, and the miss is beyond just the revenue line and mix. So, I just wonder if you might reflect on what has changed in the business to drive this trend; because prior to this period, CDW was kind of a bellwether for visibility into the business, execution on exceeding expectations. So, what has changed And then secondly, how to remediate this issue You know, what kind of changes can you make to your forecasting process or maybe internal analytics to better predict the business.\nAl Miralles: Sure. Thank you, Adam. Appreciate the question. First, look, no doubt it has been a pretty volatile period of time for now a number of quarters for sure. I would note a couple of things. Number one, when we talked about a Q1, what we were expecting going in Q2, you did ask the question about seasonality. I made the remark that we would expect it would be somewhat short of historical pre-pandemic seasonality and that it was. The delta there, Adam, was essentially the sum of federal business and international. So, two things that we had not factored in. When you actually add those back, we get pretty close to that historical seasonality. So now, so we scroll forward. We have an expectation Q2 leading to Q3, of mid-single-digit sequential growth. And really how we get there, Adam is, it's taken off some of the expectation of meaningful pickup in the business. and I would say it's following now a more normal glide path. Now, that's backed up by a couple things. One, in line or close to historical seasonality, but also just the split between first half, second half. And so, when you think about our 48/52 split between first half, second half, that's not only consistent with the history. but I also would say coming off of a softer Q1. And so, while we are definitely not anticipating an upturn, if you actually look at the trend lines, I would say it's a pretty natural glide path from where we've come from, and we think it's reasonable when you add it up to the back half of the year.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thank you. Maybe, just as a follow-up, Chris. Security is obviously a big growth driver for you and you've done well. I think you've even announced $1 billion in sales with CrowdStrike, some earlier this year. So, I guess the first question on that would be what you're seeing now at the end of July in that piece of the business given the global outage, the impact to the cyber business growth trajectory. And then secondly, beyond just the cyber business, there's an investor fear that this might have a ripple effect into other areas of spending and just cause pausing broadly. We're sitting here on July 31st. You're the largest reseller. What customer behavior are you seeing now in the month of July as that closes to indicate that might or might not occur. Thanks.\nChris Leahy: Yes. Adam, I would say customer behavior is on high alert around cybersecurity, and we're having heightened and more conversations with our customers around that. It does not feel that, that is putting off or, delaying any other engagements and projects at all. But we are seeing heightened conversation around cybersecurity.\nOperator: We have no further questions. So, I'll hand back to chair and CEO Chris Leahy for closing remarks.\nChris Leahy: Well, thank you very much. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. You show the power of execution excellence every day in every way. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you, to our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Al and I look forward to talking with you again, next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you to everyone for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Chris Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, strategic progress and view on the second half of the year. Al will provide additional detail on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Second quarter market dynamics played out roughly as we expected. Cautious customer behavior once again, elongated sales cycles and drove prioritization of needs over wants and cost savings over expansion. Capital investment in complex solutions, particularly those tied to data center and network modernization continued to be downsized or put on hold, and there was growing refresh activity in client devices. What was not expected were two end-market specific dynamics, a worsening in the UK environment and further federal funding challenges. Within the limited demand environment, we continue to help our customers build out technology roadmaps and our pipeline remains solid in the solution space. Conversion remains challenging with uncertainty weighing on our customers' appetite to spend. The team's value as a trusted adviser and ability to deliver solutions that met our customers' most pressing priorities drove excellent performance across cloud, security and services. Performance that contributed to strong profitability and cash flow, performance made possible by the strategic investments we have made over the past five years to bring full stack, full lifecycle solutions to our customers. For the quarter, the team delivered gross profit of $1.2 billion, flat year-over-year with a gross margin of 21.8%, up 80 basis points, net sales of $5.4 billion, which were down 3.6%, non-GAAP operating income of $510 million, down 3.7% with a non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.4%, which was flat and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50, which was down 2.6%. Let's take a look at this quarter's performance drivers. First, our balanced portfolio of end markets. Recall, we have five sales channels, corporate, small business, healthcare, government and education, each a meaningful business on its own with 2023 annual sales ranging from $1.6 billion to $9 billion. Channels are further segmented to focus on customer end markets including geography, verticals, customer size and spend. Teams are similarly segmented in our UK and Canadian operations, which together delivered US$2.6 billion dollars in 2023 sales. These unique customer end markets are typically uncorrelated given the different economic and external factors that impact each of them. Our second quarter results provide a good example of this. Corporate posted a net sales decline of 2%. Robust increases in cloud and security supported profitability with a meaningful increase in gross margin. Client devices increased for the second quarter in a row and posted both year-over-year and sequential sales increases of low double digits. Notably, client device ASPs held firm with a mix into higher value, higher functionality units. Once again, servers and netcomm declined as customers continue to undergo technology transitions in its real capacity. Storage was a standout category increasing double digit driven by upgrades of legacy systems. Small business net sales declined 3%. The team's ability to help customers address mission critical priorities around security and productivity with cost-effective software and cloud solutions contributed to improvements in both gross profit and margin. Small business did not see significant refresh activity and while increasing mid-single digit sequentially, client devices declined slightly year-over-year in the quarter. Consistent with corporate ongoing postponement of infrastructure investments in netcomm and servers drove low double-digit declines. Public sales declined 2% in the quarter with mixed performance by end market. Government decreased 6% as growth in state and local was more than offset by a decline in federal. Federal results were further impacted by the delayed fiscal 2024 budget authorization as several key customers did not receive funding releases until late June, weeks later than expected. These released funds face processing delays from the normal gears of government as hardware and software orders require solicitation, competitive bids and evaluation. We know that ongoing projects will eventually move forward, but some agencies may pause new projects as they await the clarity around the next administration's priority. In light of these layers of friction and uncertainty, we do not expect a federal catch up in the back half of 2024. The state and local team had another solid quarter, up mid-single digits. Security remained a key performance driver. Client devices increased by mid-single digits both year-over-year and sequentially. While early state and local budget dollars are being allocated to improving citizens experience at state and municipal agencies, including enhanced AI-powered automated response and messaging platforms. Healthcare net sales were flat. Security remained a key focus area and the team delivered robust customer spend and gross profit growth, led by security assessments for cloud migration and identity management. Driven by refresh, client devices increased by double digits. The team's ability to deliver cloud migration, including moving applications out of hospital data centers, drove excellent cloud performance and contributed to both increased gross margin and profitability. Education sales declined roughly 1%. K-12's top line was roughly flat year-over-year while profitability grew. For the second quarter in a row, client device sales increased up mid-single digits as school systems refreshed aged Chromebooks. Security and cloud remain top priorities, both delivering strong growth and gross profit. Once again, collaboration hardware, primarily smart whiteboards and interactive flat panels, declined meaningfully as schools continue to digest significant purchases made over the past several years. With the sunsetting of ETF funds and upcoming deadlines for ESSER funds of September 30th, the team is focused on helping their customers pivot to refresh programs funded through traditional mechanisms. Consistent with recent quarters, higher ed institutions remained focused on investments to enhance student experience to drive enrollment, while doing more with less, and the team posted a mid-single-digit top-line decline. Cost elasticity continued to drive strong double-digit growth in cloud. Security remained a top priority, up strong double digits and client devices returned to growth in the quarter, up high single digits driven by refresh. Our UK and Canadian international operations, which we reported other, declined 13%. While both teams continue to execute well, the demand environment, particularly in the UK, worsened during the quarter as the early general election amplified already challenging conditions. UK sales declined high teens in US dollars and Canada declined 4% in US dollars. Given current conditions, we expect the UK market to remain volatile and under pressure through the back half of the year. As you can see, the diversity of our end markets results is fundamental to the first driver of our performance, our balanced portfolio of customer end markets. Category performance demonstrates the benefit of our second performance driver, our broad and deep portfolio of products and solutions. Transactions categories increased during the quarter while solutions categories declined. Both transactions and solutions increased sequentially in the quarter. At the portfolio level, hardware decreased 5%. High single-digit client device growth and mid-single-digit steward growth was more than offset by meaningful declines in netcomm and collaboration. Software customer spend increased mid-single digits while net sales were impacted by our strong mix into netted down revenue and decreased by 1%. Services increased by 6% driven by cloud and security-related services. Once again, cloud was an important performance driver, contributing double-digit gross profit growth across software, services and security. Profitable growth that was enabled by the strategic investments, both organic and acquired, we have made in solutions and services capabilities over the past five years. And this leads to the final driver of our performance in the quarter, our three-part strategy for growth, which is; first, acquired new customers and capture share; second, enhanced our solution of capabilities; and third, expand our services capabilities. Each pillar is crucial to our ability to profitably advise, design, orchestrate and manage the solutions our customers want and need in any environment. Let me share an example of our strategy and action as we delivered on a customer's priority in today's challenging demand environment. An insurance company faced early end of life for its hyperconverged infrastructure equipment, something not contemplated in their already tight budget. Armed with our broad and deep cloud portfolio, our cloud, hybrid infrastructure and services group collaborated to architect a cloud subscription-based solution that delivered cost elasticity, the customer's budget could absorb. The multi-faceted solution seamlessly moved on-premise workloads and data to the public cloud, delivered cloud compute, migrated custom and off-the-shelf applications, created a virtual desktop infrastructure and delivered security measures with virtual firewalls. Plus, it optimized workloads to ensure the customer effectively managed CPU usage, memory and storage, further mitigating costs. This comprehensive solution generated more than $1 million in product revenue and a multi-million dollar CDW professional services engagement. After seeing our cloud expertise in action, the customer engaged us for additional cloud solutions, including identity management and unified cloud call center ongoing managed services. Today, we were one of the customers' most valued strategic partners. A great example of how we're delivering value to our customers both for today and for the future. And that leads me to our expectations for the balance of the year. You will recall that on the last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2024 U.S. IT market growth in the low single digits. And our target to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market. This factored in a modest improvement in demand conditions in the second half of the year. Given real-time feedback from our large and diverse customer base, we now expect current market conditions to persist throughout the year, not get worse, but not get better. Given the market's slow start to the year, without a second-half demand pickup, we now look for U.S. IT market growth up towards the lower end of a low single-digit range. We continue to maintain our target to grow 200 basis points to 300 basis points above market. Growth will return. The demand drivers are there. Workload and data growth, increased security threats, client device obsolescence, and adoption of AI-powered assistance and applications. But customers need greater clarity and confidence, clarity around economic conditions and clarity around the impact of AI on their tech roadmap, and confidence that investments made today will deliver the right foundations and economic returns in an AI-powered future. Improved demand conditions are a function of when, not if. Wildcards for the balance of 2024 include the potential of greater macro and geopolitical uncertainty, significant degradation of market conditions in the UK, as well as unusual uncertainty in the U.S. election. As we always do, we will provide an updated perspective on business conditions as we move through the year. Whatever the market conditions, we will remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers, gaining share and executing with the discipline and rigor that is CDW's hallmark. And we will continue to play the long game, holding steadfast in our commitment to executing against our growth strategy to ensure we have the solutions and services capabilities our customers need to achieve their mission critical outcomes. With that, let me turn it over to Al, who will share more detail on our financial performance. Yes. Good morning, Amit. Thanks for the question. As we think about, let me start with the first part of that question, the outlook, and I'll just walk you through. I mean, at high level, that our outlook, incorporated a modest uptick in the second half demand of 2024. And that change really reflects, that we think current market conditions will persist. I think, I said not get worse, excuse me, but not get better. And that's just based on our market intelligence with our customers and our frontline coworkers. If you want to go through the puts and takes, look, when we start with corporate after a long period of fits and starts, and what I'll call uneven performance, corporate feels on more solid footing and is demonstrating a steadier rhythm to the business. That said, with signs of stability, it's still a bit too early to call and to bake that into the expectation in the back half of the year. Just need to see a couple more data points to build confidence on that one. Small business, I'd say not getting worse, not quite as volatile, but still bouncing along the bottom, so not seeing an uptick there. And then we've got these two end markets that had very unique impacts and we think will impact going forward. The UK, the degradation in the UK that I mentioned in the environment there, which impacted the second quarter and expecting impact the second half of the year. And then the federal gears of government, these two delays are just creating, frankly, a bottleneck that's not overcomeable at this point, on the federal side. And so, we don't expect to see a pickup back in the second half of the year in federal as we expected to. So, I just say that the outlook net-net reflects that there's no substantive change in the commercial market demand. It incorporates normal seasonality and it also includes, I guess, a moderate IT refresh across primarily client devices and some other solutions that can't be postponed. So, that's the way that we're thinking about the outlook. I think you asked a question on forecasting. And I would just say that on the forecasting, look, the team is doing a phenomenal job staying highly-engaged with our customers and pivoting, when needed. As you can see from our results, security cloud, software services results, it's very clear that we -- our portfolio and our people allow us to be the trusted adviser and support in the moment in the market type solutions. The forecasting is, yes, it's a little bumpier. because you've got lumpy - lumpy-big deals and they're all interrelated. There's no the example that I shared during the script. You see how interrelated and complex the solutions are. So, as those push, they push. but I think the team's doing a great job staying engaged with customers. And I would also say that our solutions pipeline is really quite strong. It's been the conversion given the market that is reflecting the appetite to buy, but the pipeline is really quite strong. Yes. I would say on the networking side, there's certainly interest from customers on network modernization. That is a high priority. but there is still significant digestion going on. The supply chain is normalized, but we still have customers that are digesting what they purchased or actually received, I should say, later in the cycle. I think as we get back to the back half of the year, the overlaps will look a little bit different and so the performance will likely look a little bit different. But I would just say it's high priority. There's just still a lot of excess at our customers that they're digesting. On the server side, on the mid-market server side, we are seeing some strength in that area. but again, it's subject to our customers really, being cautious about where they're spending and pivoting a little more to cloud and elastic advisable solutions at this time. Oh, Keith. Thanks for the question. First of all, it was CDW didn't impact us that much, which was great. But I'll tell you, I'm really proud of this team. They were so quick to help customers do boot-refixes and workarounds and essentially, get after customers immediately. So, it just reinforced, I think, the fact that we have such strong relationships with our customers and that the trust adviser role is so important. Once you do a transaction with a customer, it's not one and done, but this just reflected the fact that the aftercare and the relationship ongoing is so important. So, it was a very unfortunate, obviously, circumstance across the world, but really proud of the team for stepping up and stepping in with our customers. Oh, absolutely. Yes. So, in circumstances like this, when we have been able to help, when there's a particular issue that's popped up that absolutely goes back and across the sales organization, we take it to other customers to help highlight potential vulnerabilities and then help them resolve those. Same in the security space. That's what we do. Yes. well, we think about the pipeline -- excuse me, we think about the pipeline, starting first, in terms of engagement with our customers and staying very close to our customers and doing and suggesting solutions that are best for them. In a market now, where cost optimization is high and needs are prioritized over once. A CDW is very careful to help our customers accommodate that, which might mean that not new and not growth revenue, but revenue that is finding cost optimization for them. All that said, what we do in an environment like this is we work hard to increase the pipeline to ensure that when it's time to convert, it's sufficient to drive growth. We do all the things that we do with a lot of rigor. We inspect the pipeline. We grow the pipeline. We measure the pipeline. We drive conversations with our customers. It's really just the appetite to convert at this point that we're not seeing. Now as I said, what has been very positive is the rhythm of the business feels, feels more stable, feels a little more firmer footing. and I think that's a good indicator of moving to more solid footing, which means a pipeline converting it in the not-too-distant future, which will convert into growth. Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ruplu. I'd answer it this way. Look, we're really in the very early innings of AI monetization, and CDW is investing behind and doing well frankly. We're investing primarily in people and enablement, and doing well in the areas that are kind of early stage, which I would say, are consultative primarily at this point. AI certainly opens conversations with customers extensively. But I would say our opportunity, the massive opportunity for CDW is full stack over the long run, and I would call this a long a long game. look, it feels very much, and we've said this before that AI is like any other kind of transformative technology of the past. and it plays to CDW's strengths. Complexity and choice always make it more difficult for our customers, and that helps us bring our knowledge, expertise and portfolio to bear. So, as I think forward, we do see it as an accelerant. We're investing behind it. Our customers are still at the stage of what's the art of getting this done and how's the sign what's the science of doing it. It's just a matter, frankly, Ruplu, of what the time frame of growth looks like over the long term. but I feel confident that we'll play it every -- at every layer of the stack. And it will be embedded in every layer of the stack. Yes. George, I would just -- I would reiterate that we're still seeing that AI has put the architectural roadmap for compute storage and networking under reevaluation and flux, and we're still seeing that play out this quarter. I actually expect that to last for some period of time as we help customers sort through again, what the art of the possibilities. but then what's the actual return on investment dollars. Sure, George. I would just say that we feel very confident that we continue to gain share in this low demand and limited demand market across virtually every category. You saw our results for security and for services, and cloud, client device refresh is starting to pick up. And this is validated both by, obviously, our own data, but equally our partner reviews. our partners validate that we are indeed taking shares that we're feeling very good about, where we're positioned in a limited growth environment. Yes. Sure. So, I'd say look, capital investment and complex solutions, especially those tied to data center and network modernization are the ones that I highlighted as areas of more caution right now, given the uncertainty and also the increasingly complex technology landscape. Compute, we did see some pickup. That's really because, it was put off for some quite some time by a number of customers. and so there was a need to upgrade for against legacy systems. And then on the client side, as I said, we started to see, what we think is the beginnings of a refresh. Obviously, given all the catalyst there, that's going to be sustainable. The aged devices, Win 11, AI PCs, et cetera. We expect that to be a real refresh. And then I say sustainability in the clouds, where you saw strength this quarter in particular, cloud security and services in particular, I don't see those slowing down anytime soon. They're a great opportunity to offset some of those capital investments. They're a great opportunity for cost optimization and optimization generally. So, our customers have turned to them and with our portfolio, the beautiful thing about our is whatever our customers are buying, whenever they're buying it, we can give them the solution they need. So, very well prepared to deliver today and as we start to see a recovery in the capital investment appetite. Yes. Adam, I would say customer behavior is on high alert around cybersecurity, and we're having heightened and more conversations with our customers around that. It does not feel that, that is putting off or, delaying any other engagements and projects at all. But we are seeing heightened conversation around cybersecurity. Well, thank you very much. I want to recognize the incredible dedication of our coworkers around the globe and their extraordinary commitment to serving our customers, our partners and all CDW stakeholders. You show the power of execution excellence every day in every way. And thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to serve you, to our investors and analysts participating in this call, we appreciate you and your continued interest in and support of CDW. Al and I look forward to talking with you again, next quarter."

            "name": "Al Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with details on our Q2 performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our updated 2024 outlook. Second quarter gross profit of $1.2 billion is roughly flat, up 0.1% versus the prior year. This is modestly below our original expectations for low single-digit growth for the quarter as the aforementioned strength in cloud, security and services was offset by lower demand for netcomm and collaboration hardware. Consolidated second quarter net sales of $5.4 billion were down 3.6% versus the prior year on both reported and average daily sales basis and up 11.3% sequentially, driven by seasonally higher demand in education channels and government channels and especially pursuant to client devices. Gross margin increased approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. Gross margin of 21.8% was flat quarter-over-quarter and broadly in line with both full-year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024. Second quarter year-over-year margin expansion was primarily driven by the higher mix in the sales, where CDW acts as agent, also known as netted down sales. This category grew by 8.7%, once again, outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 33.2% of our gross profit, compared to 30.6% in the prior year's second quarter. Year-over-year expansion came from our teams continuing to successfully serve customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. The netted down category of solutions represents an important and durable trend within our business, contributing to our ability to deliver enhanced gross margins. It is important to note that netted down sales growth and its impact on our mix of business will fluctuate over time with customer priorities and product demand. Second quarter gross profit was up 11.3%, compared to the first quarter of 2024 on both reported and sequential average daily sales basis. While second quarter sequential net sales and gross profit growth were higher than the sequential growth rate seen in the last few years, they were very modestly behind our own expectations, as well as historical seasonal upturn we experienced in pre-pandemic years. This reflected two factors, longer-than-expected delays in spend from our federal customers related to the prior congressional budget impasse and lower performance by our UK business, which is impacted by volatility in the economic and political climate. Turning to expenses for the second quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $673 million, up 3.2% year-over-year. Expenses were roughly consistent with the expectation we shared on our last earnings call, including expense efficiency ratio more in line with normal levels. The improvement from the first quarter reflected higher gross profit attainment and relatively lower level expenses on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Coworker count at the end of the second quarter was approximately 15,200, up slightly over the first quarter and year-end. Customer facing coworker count was also slightly up at approximately 11,000. Our goal is to balance driving growth and exceptional customer experience with efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations. Non-GAAP operating income totaled $510 million, down 3.7% versus the prior year, driven by the combination of roughly flat gross profit and moderately higher expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.4% was flat to the prior year and up from 8.3% in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $339 million in the quarter, down 2.9% on a year-over-year basis. The second quarter weighted average diluted shares of 135.6 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.50. Moving to the balance sheet. At period end, net debt was roughly $5 billion. Net debt has declined by approximately $93 million since year-end 2023, primarily reflecting our increased cash position alongside modest debt repayment. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $1.9 billion. The three-month average cash conversion cycle was 17 days, up three days from the prior year, but still at the lower end of our targeted range of high-teens to low-20s. This cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital, including active management of our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Adjusted free cash flow was $138.4 million in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and seasonal business trends. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was a healthy $503 million, an 84% of non-GAAP net income within our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90%. First-half performance puts us on track to meet our 2024 objectives. For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $202 million in share repurchases and $83 million in the form of dividends. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024. That brings me to our capital allocation priorities. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio in 2024. Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place. We ended the second quarter at 2.4 times within our targeted net leverage range of two to three times. We will continue to proactively manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility. Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We continually evaluate M&A opportunities that could accelerate our three-part strategy for growth. Year-to-date, we've utilized over $250 million of cash on share repurchases and have over $830 million remaining under our current share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023 have persisted well into 2024. Customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent across end markets, particularly in the commercial, international and federal channels. Last quarter, we spoke about the slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending and shared our expectations for tough conditions to persist in the near-term, but to modestly improve in the second half. At the same time, we noted a compelling need for our customers to address cloud workload growth, increasing security threats and aging client devices. These priorities continue to resonate with customers and were brighter spots in the second quarter, while uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a complex technology landscape weigh on customer demand for solutions hardware. Given these market conditions, our updated full-year 2024 expectation is for flat-to-low single-digit gross profit growth, a view that incorporates both our slower start to the year and our view that the mild recovery we anticipated in the second half is not likely to materialize. This leads to seasonality roughly in line with historical levels, with the first half contributing approximately 48% of net sales and gross profit. We maintain our expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full-year 2023 and much like we've seen throughout the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect our full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be flat to up slightly year-over-year. Please remember we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full-year constant currency basis. Moving to modeling thoughts for the third quarter. We anticipate low single-digit gross profit growth compared to the prior year with no change to our expectation that gross margin will be comparable to full-year 2023 and the first half of 2024. This leads to roughly normal seasonality, compared to historical levels and also the moderately lower second quarter base. We continue to expect the fourth quarter to be meaningfully lower, compared to the third quarter, principally due to seasonally lower demand from education and government customers. Moving down the P&L. We expect third quarter operating expenses to be moderately higher than the third quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis given the higher gross profit performance, but at a similar ratio relative to gross profit. We expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to grow in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year. For full-year 2024, we are maintaining our expectation for adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income. We currently sit comfortably within that range. That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls. And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Amit. Good morning. I'll take that question. Nothing too significant there to report, Amit. I would just say that, within the array of the product sectors, we did see strength in storage in a couple other categories that supplemented our client device margins. And then further, I would note that on the client device side of the house, we continue to see firm margins there including, and Chris alluded to this, kind of a higher mix in the kind of premium product, if you will. So, overall, we continue to see an environment, where product margins appear to be holding up. And obviously, as you pointed out, they are further supplemented by the growth that we continue to see on the netted down revenue stream side. Good morning, Matt. I would just note, look, we are still going to see reasonably normal seasonality from the government business. And remember, there's significant strength there on the state and local side of things. So look, even in the quarter, state and local offsetted some of that compression from a federal perspective. So, I would say it's all in the realm of regular normal seasonality for government, with just a downtick a bit in federal for Q3 and Q4. Sure. Good morning, Assia. A couple of things that I would just note. Number one, remember when we started the year, we indicated that we would have expected the beginning of the year would reflect higher level of expenses than usual and a ratio of SG&A relative to GP would ease as the year played out. Asiya, some of that is a function of just timing and seasonality of certain expenses that we see in the first half, some of it a function of our lower GP production -- gross profit production in the first half. And then just from a compare perspective, I would just note for you that, that last year obviously was a pretty uneven year, if you will. And pretty early in the year, we saw indications that our outlook was coming down. So that has an impact on the timing and our judgments with respect to things like compensation accruals. So, because of that, when you add it all together, our first half, we look a bit more shifting towards deleverage from an expense perspective. And what you should expect in the back half is that, that would ease, that would balance out obviously as our gross profit attainment would be higher. but also, you get a bit kind of a pickup from a seasonality timing of our expenses as well. So, for the full year, we expect it would look reasonably normal. The back half is going to look a lot different than it did in the first half vis-a\u0300-vis operating leverage. Sure. Thank you, Ruplu. Look, for the full year, we are calling for gross margins to look much like the first half did and frankly then much like 2023 in total. What you can expect there is continued durability and trending of our netted down revenues, which have been extremely strong. We would expect that would continue. And particularly, I'd say, in the year, we typically see more of that with renewals, of cloud and SaaS contracts et cetera. And that would be balanced with our regular mix of business, including expectation kind of a glide path of our client business. Now, on the non-netted down margins, I'll just note again, that product margins there have continued to help hold firm, and that's been quite a run, where they've been firm and we would expect that to continue. So, that's the sum of the different parts, Ruplu, to get us to that gross margin expectation very similar in the back half as what we saw in the first half. Sure, Samik. I'll take it. This is Al. So, just reminder what categories fall into netted down. You have software assurance. You have warranty. You have SaaS. You have cloud. Right. So, the big components, if you will. The strength that we've seen obviously has been substantially in the SaaS and cloud space. and that runs the gamut in terms of underlying workloads in those categories. Right That includes data, virtualization software, networking to some degree. So, it runs the gamut in those categories. They've been the leaders in that space. I should note, Samik, there, with that over the last year, categories such as software assurance and warranty obviously have lagged. because they are substantially attached to products, hardware and software -- licensed software that is. And so they've been laggards, which at some point as we talk about the catalyst and things beginning to turn from a hardware perspective, you could see some of those categories pick up. But in the meantime, as we are now saying, Hannah, we think that recovery is going to take a little bit more time, the most durable trends are in the SaaS and cloud space. Sure. Thank you, Adam. Appreciate the question. First, look, no doubt it has been a pretty volatile period of time for now a number of quarters for sure. I would note a couple of things. Number one, when we talked about a Q1, what we were expecting going in Q2, you did ask the question about seasonality. I made the remark that we would expect it would be somewhat short of historical pre-pandemic seasonality and that it was. The delta there, Adam, was essentially the sum of federal business and international. So, two things that we had not factored in. When you actually add those back, we get pretty close to that historical seasonality. So now, so we scroll forward. We have an expectation Q2 leading to Q3, of mid-single-digit sequential growth. And really how we get there, Adam is, it's taken off some of the expectation of meaningful pickup in the business. and I would say it's following now a more normal glide path. Now, that's backed up by a couple things. One, in line or close to historical seasonality, but also just the split between first half, second half. And so, when you think about our 48/52 split between first half, second half, that's not only consistent with the history. but I also would say coming off of a softer Q1. And so, while we are definitely not anticipating an upturn, if you actually look at the trend lines, I would say it's a pretty natural glide path from where we've come from, and we think it's reasonable when you add it up to the back half of the year."

Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, our strategic progress and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Market conditions remained challenging, and first quarter results came in below our expectations. \n For the quarter, gross profit was $1.1 billion, 2% lower than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $404 million, down 7%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $1.92, down 6%. \n In the first quarter, customers demonstrated caution and concern given heightened macro uncertainty, weighing on capital investment decisions. At the same time, the complexities of the tech landscape continued to ratchet up, particularly given the additional layer of AI and changes in the IT market landscape. This lengthened decision-making as customers deliberated on both how to navigate technology road map and when to spend on infrastructure in a challenging economic environment. While activity was reflected in a solid pipeline with deals being pushed out, our sales and gross profit lagged.  \n Results were also impacted by the federal budget stalemate, which led to a pause in our federal channel. Bottom line, while many of these factors are beyond our control, we are never satisfied. And as we do not expect decision cycles to improve in the near term, we remain focused on accelerating pipeline growth and using all of our competitive advantages to take share in this low-growth environment.  \n During the quarter, our teams maintained a high level of engagement, working with customers to implement mission-critical projects, help prioritize and evaluate options, develop multiyear plans and prove out use cases. You see the impact of this in our gross margin, which was a first quarter record and our excellent cash flow, which together reinforce the durability of our underlying profitability and integrity of our strategies. Whatever the market condition, we are laser-focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers. To ensure we continue to deliver on this commitment, we remain resolute in our strategy and continue to invest to ensure we have the capabilities to deliver full stack solutions and services.  \n Broadly speaking, customer priorities included cost optimization, data protection and workforce productivity. This drove focus on security, cloud and as a service as well as client demand and interest in AI. Let's take a look at how all of these priorities impacted performance. \n First, customer end market performance. Recall, we have 5 sales channels: corporate, small business, health care, government and education end markets, each a meaningful business on its own with 2023 annual sales ranging from $1.6 billion to $9 billion. Within each channel, the teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. \n Our commercial operations are organized around geographies, verticals, customer size and spend. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered USD 2.6 billion in 2023 sales. These unique customer end markets often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each of them. Corporate top line declined 3% year-over-year. Decision-making further elongated with heightened focus on ROI and a high level of project scrutiny, given interest rate expectations.  \n Cloud and security prioritization continued to drive excellent increases in customer spend and the team capitalized on client device demand and year-over-year client sales were up low double digits. Corporate saw declines in hardware categories undergoing transition and absorbing capacity notably servers and NetComm. \n Storage, however, was a standout category up double digits, driven by data and workload growth as customers improve efficiency and capture savings from newer solutions. Small business posted a 7% year-over-year top line decline, but with sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter.  \n The team continued to help customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity which drove meaningful increases in cloud and software customer spend. Consistent with corporate NetComm and servers declined and storage increased. Small business continued to be accretive to overall margins. Client devices posted a sequential increase yet remained down year-over-year. \n Public sales declined 5% from the prior year. Health care declined 2%, transactional performance was positive with an increase in client devices, while solutions declined. Health care performance was similar to commercial with customer caution given the significant focus on cost optimization. Security was also a major focus area, delivering double-digit increases in spend and gross profit.  \n State and local mid-teens increase was more than offset by a decline in federal top line and total government declined 1.5%. State and local performance was broad-based with strength across transactional and solutions categories. Client devices sales increased for the third quarter in a row, up high teens. Public safety remained a key focus area with security up substantially double digits. \n Cloud adoption continued to gain traction. Federal's mid-teens decline was driven by the congressional budget impact, which was not resolved until late March. Some activity related to existing contracts continued, including client device refreshes, which drove a mid-teen increase, larger-scale network and data center projects paused. Engagement remains strong, and we expect to pick up and spend once agencies are able to allocate their appropriated funds.  \n It continues to be a challenging environment for education and the segment posted a 10% decline. Consistent with recent quarters, higher ed institutions remain focused on doing more with less, and the team posted a mid-teens top line decline. Hardware categories declined across the board, while ongoing focus on cost elasticity led to a strong double-digit increase in cloud.  \n K-12's top line decreased by high single digits. Client device sales increased by low single digits, with some school systems refreshing aged Chromebooks, several funded via normal operating budgets and not stimulus programs. Audiovisual solutions like smart whiteboards and interactive flat panels posted a substantial decline as schools continue to digest purchases from the past several years. Security remained a top priority in both top line and gross profit increased by mid-single digits. Our U.K. and Canadian international operations, which we report as Other continued to experience challenging market conditions and each declined by mid-single digits.  \n Both teams continue to execute well and are leveraging their capabilities to deliver great outcomes for our customers. For the most part, portfolio performance was consistent across customer end markets. Transactional product sales performed somewhat better than solutions and modestly increased sequentially. Both posted year-over-year declines with a greater decline in solutions from the fits and starts of decision-making. \n At the portfolio level, hardware top line decreased by 4%. Services also decreased by 4% as weakness in services tied to hardware more than offset growth in managed services, which increased by low teens. Even though software net sales declined by 7%, gross profit increased slightly year-over-year. Top line performance was driven by declines in licensed software due to accelerated transitions to SaaS models.  \n Let's turn now to the topic that is getting a lot of attention, AI, and specifically what we are doing for our customers in this space. Right now, most of our customers are at the initial stages of the assessment process, developing and analyzing use cases and adopting data governance best practices to deliver insights and ensure end-to-end security. \n Essentially, they are exploring the art of the possibility and working through the science of exactly how do we do this. This is exciting work for all of us and our customers. The complexity of adopting AI plays to our strength. We know how to bridge the gap between the promise of technology and transformational outcomes. And since deploying AI drives the need for technology investment across the full stack with entry points across the entire stack, we are uniquely positioned to serve our customers, and we are doing that today. \n To support our customers as they navigate successful AI adoption, we offer 2 broad areas of consulting services. First, connecting AI to outcomes and ROI, which we call AI discovery, and second, a practical approach to implementing AI, including data governance and security, which we call Master Operational AI Transition, or MOAT. While still early innings, these services are gaining traction.  \n We scoped the broad AI opportunity around 4 areas of focus: workforce productivity, notably end-use assistance and edge devices; high-value use cases; broad-scale vertical solutions; and full stack where customers rely on us to provide the infrastructure underlying applications and solutions. A great example of full stack is the corporate training and development, domain-specific large language model solution we shared with you last quarter. \n Our broad-scale solutions are vertically based. As you know, we have expertise across many verticals, including health care, financial services in many key industry segments, expertise that enables us to deeply understand the unique needs and challenges faced by organizations in these sectors and tailor solutions and services that directly address their opportunities and pain points.  \n Let's take a look at a couple of the vertical AI examples. First, our AI offering for the K-12 market. AI presents an exciting opportunity to empower teachers and improve learning outcomes, but it must be done very carefully. Our education team has leveraged its expertise and relationships in this field to offer a safe AI platform that is specifically designed for K-12 classroom with a custom large language model that generates responses from embedded educational content, not the entire Internet. \n The second example is a proprietary CDW health care solution, Patient Room 'Next'. While AI holds the promise of medical breakthroughs, our solution addresses the intense pressure institutions face to manage costs while sustaining high levels of patient outcomes. Our solution combines AI and connected devices to transform patient rooms, improve care delivery and enhance overall health care experiences.  \n The solution is HIPAA-compliant and runs on an end-to-end intelligent platform powered by GPUs, a platform that provides real-time insights from data and automated documentation. One current application serves over 300 beds and builds $4 million in annual licensing. Add to that, the services and equipment we provide for an end-to-end solution like cameras, network connections and servers, and you can see the opportunity this represents to deliver value for our customers and for CDW. \n Of course, AI will take time to become embedded across our entire customer set, we know that, we have been here before as we've helped our customers adopt cloud. And while the hype cycle is much shorter than cloud, the adoption is very similar. Bottom line, we are here for our customers today and will be there for them in the future as they continue to ramp their efforts. And that leads me to our thoughts on the balance of 2024.  \n You will recall that on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2024 U.S. IT market growth in the low single digits and our target to grow 200 to 300 basis points above market. Despite the slow start to the year, we still see potential for market growth. Let me be clear that we do not expect to demand hockey stick but do see potential for client device refresh and for improved solutions performance. Wildcards include further dampening of capital investment from sustained high interest rates, worsening of geopolitical issues as well as unusual election year uncertainty.  \n As we always do, we will update our view of the market as we move through the year. A hallmark of CDW is to serve our customers wherever their priorities lie. As we look ahead, our customers face a compelling need to address cloud workload growth, protect against increasing security threats, manage an aging client device base and navigate All Things Data as they build out their plans to leverage AI to capture insights and achieve their productivity aspirations. Armed with our full stack, full outcomes, full life cycle portfolio and unique vertical expertise, no one is more prepared to help our customers successfully navigate this period of unprecedented change.  \n With that, let me turn it over to Al. \nAlbert Miralles: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with detail on our first quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2024 outlook.  \n Turning to the first quarter. We began 2024 experiencing the same uneven IT market conditions that we faced throughout last year. Caution on uncertainty range, high interest rates and growing pessimism towards the timing of rate cuts but deals under even greater scrutiny and ultimately led to the dampening of capital investment. \n Customers are evaluating, optimizing their IT spending. And while we actively partner with them to build out tech road maps to support their strategies, the overhang of economic and financial uncertainties as the delay in deliberation and ultimate decision-making, exacerbating elongated sales cycles. During the quarter, we were able to capitalize on demand for client devices as some customers could no longer postpone refresh activity with sales of more complex solutions tied to digital transformation and network modernization were weaker.  \n Notwithstanding, we see the potential for both client device refresh activity to continue and for improved future conversion of our solid solutions pipeline. Moving on to the specific results. First quarter gross profit was $1.1 billion, down 2.4% versus prior year and below our original expectations for low single-digit growth for the quarter. \n Consolidated first quarter net sales of $4.9 billion were down 4.5% versus prior year on a reported and average daily sales basis. Gross margin increased roughly 50 basis points year-over-year and partially offset the impact of lower net sales. Gross margin of 21.8% was a first quarter record and was broadly in line with both full year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024.  \n First quarter margin expansion was primarily driven by higher mix in netted-down revenues. This category grew by 6%, once again outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 35.1% of our gross profit compared to 32.3% in the prior year first quarter as our teams were successful serving customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. While we continue to expect the mix of netted-down revenues to be an important and durable trend within our business, it is important to recognize that this mix may fluctuate with customer priorities and product demand.  \n However, even with a higher mix of client devices, margins remained firm in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter gross profit was down 7.8% compared to the fourth quarter on a reported basis. On a sequential average daily sales basis, first quarter net sales decreased 4.4%. While first quarter net sales and gross profit are typically lower than the fourth quarter, we had anticipated a more modest sequential decline as early 2024 customer engagement suggested more balanced spending across categories than we ultimately experienced.  \n Instead, the sequential decline this quarter was more in line with traditional seasonality, reflecting continued uncertain conditions impacting the spend of our corporate customers in addition to the congressional budget for laying spending of federal customers. \n Turning to expenses for the first quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $660 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. Expenses were consistent with the expectation we shared on our last earnings call, with the first quarter higher than the fourth quarter as we reset some of our variable expenses for the year and accrue for other seasonally higher items. This played out as expected, but our expense efficiency ratio was further elevated due to our lower gross profit production for the quarter.  \n As we scroll forward, we continue to manage discretionary expenses prudently and diligently while balancing this against both our expectations for the year and the need to expand our capabilities and drive future growth. Our discipline was also reflected in our coworker count at the end of the first quarter, which was approximately 15,000 and down slightly relative to year-end 2023. \n Customer-facing coworker count was also unchanged at approximately 10,900. As we expand our solutions and services capabilities, we are concurrently driving efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations intended to fund these investments.  \n Following along on Slide 8, we delivered non-GAAP operating income of $404 million, down 7.1% versus the prior year driven by the combination of our gross profit shortfall and flat expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.3% was down 20 basis points from the prior year. As reflected on Slide 9, our non-GAAP net income was $261 million in the quarter, down 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. With first quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately 136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.92 was down 5.5% year-over-year.  \n Moving ahead to Slide 10. At period end, net debt was $4.8 billion. Net debt declined by approximately $230 million from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting our increased cash position alongside modest debt repayment during the quarter. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion.  \n Moving to Slide 11. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down 2 days from the prior year and slightly below our target range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital particularly with respect to our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. \n We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Despite profit that was moderately lower than our expectations, effective working capital management drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $364 million, as shown on Slide 12. Over the last 12 months, adjusted free cash flow was 104% of non-GAAP net income, well above our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90%. As we've mentioned in the past, timing will impact adjusted free cash flow throughout the year, but we're pleased with our first quarter performance, and we'll continue to update our outlook on this front as the year plays out.  \n For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $83 million to shareholders through dividends and $52 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024.  \n That brings me to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 13. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio in 2024 growing the dividend in line with earnings. \n Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the first quarter at 2.3x, down from 2.4x at the end of 2023 and within our targeted range of 2 to 3x. We will continue to manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility.  \n Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We currently have over $1 billion of availability under our share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook on Slide 14. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023, have persisted into 2024, and customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent. \n Last quarter, we spoke about a slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending, which has come to fruition and will likely continue in the near-term. However, as we look forward, we continue to see a compelling need to address cloud workload growth, increasing security threats, aging client devices and All Things Data, as we help our customers build out their plans to leverage AI and capture insights and achieve their productivity aspirations.  \n Our updated full year 2024 expectation is for low single-digit gross profit growth, reflecting the slower start to the year. We maintain our view that customers will spend their IT budgets in the upcoming quarters, but within the context of historical seasonality. With this also comes an unchanged expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full year 2023. \n Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be up low single digits year-over-year. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 15.  \n Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter, we anticipate low single-digit gross profit growth compared to the prior year. With no change to our expectation that gross margin will be comparable to full year 2023 and Q1 2024. Our first half/second half split is slightly more weighted to the second half than historical levels in keeping with our expectation for the market. However, we still anticipate seasonal quarterly patterns to reasonably hold, including a lower fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. \n Moving down the P&L. We expect second quarter operating expenses to be moderately higher than the second quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis, but reflecting a more normalized ratio relative to gross profit than we experienced in Q1. \n Finally, we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be in the low single-digit range year-over-year. For 2024, we're maintaining our expectation for adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income, assuming a higher level of working capital investments to support growth.  \n That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls.  \n And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. \nAdam Tindle: I just wanted to start one of the big themes during the tech earnings season is spending on AI as very, very strong and I appreciate all your comments in the prepared remarks. But it's hard not to dovetail that with CDW results here for Q1 that were a little bit weaker than expected and showing a decline in solutions where presumably AI would be reporting. Just figured I'd throw it out there to address any investor concerns that perhaps CDW is not participating in AI spending. What would that thesis be missing and if there's portions of that, that might be fair, things that you can do to capitalize more on AI spending, whether that's organic or inorganic? \nChristine Leahy: If I could, let me zoom out first and then zoom back into AI. Let me just start with the environment that we experienced in Q1. There are a couple of factors that impacted results in complex solutions results. And look, we had a dynamic in a pretty complex environment that manifested in what I would call fits and starts of both the market and our customers who have lack of certainty and visibility. \n You take the first economic and financial uncertainty. In other words, the interest rate and inflation environment and that was really the primary driver of the impact for our corporate team and our small business team. And that created an overhang in the environment, which drove what I'll call an uneven market condition situation pretty similar to the trends we saw in 2023.  \n And as a result, our customers remain cautious. They remain prudent, there is relentless scrutiny on deals across the board in the solutions space, in particular, as customers focused on cost optimization and short-term ROI and ultimately, that dampened capital investment in the period. \n I'd also say to a lesser degree, AI considerations as an added complexity in the deliberation process enter the picture. We're at a real inflection point with AI, critical decision for all of our businesses, understanding what it means to their business and their workforce, what it means to their road map, technology road maps and what the implications for infrastructure are.  \n I just would highlight a couple of other pressure points during the quarter or a lesser impact, but we had some changes in the IT landscape with some consolidation and acceleration into -- as a service, which creates a natural interruption, I would say, in just the customer process. Fed budgets delayed and then the education market is transitioning really back to a more normalized funding mechanism. And the result of all of that was collectively, we had to spend deficits. \n What I would say is our engagement overall is incredibly strong. I'm really pleased with the engagement, and we are seeing that our value continues to build as we help our customers manage the complex tech environment and a dynamic period, but what didn't happen is the solid pipeline that, that translated into did not then translate into invoicing in the solutions portfolio as it would in a normal operating environment.  \n Now while we have seen the pause on the complex solutions, we are helping customers who need to refresh client actually start doing that. And that's some positive signs in what I'll call a lower risk, lower-friction client [ story ]. But at the end of the day, right, it was solutions that impacted our results overall. Now if I flip to your question on AI, here's what I'd say. \n Look, we're in the early innings. Some of our customers are advanced, but really most are in an assessment and experimentation stage, and it's going to unfold over time. CDW is uniquely positioned in the space to take advantage of what will be ubiquitous and a full stack opportunity. We know how to take customers on the journey. We've done it before, this art and science of new technologies. We've got the full stack and broad portfolio. So we can help customers at every entry point. \n And we've got services against the entire part of the stack and across the life cycle. And so we've got the ability to deliver integrated solutions. We also understand our customers' pain points and opportunities given our deep vertical expertise and our intimacy with our customers. So we have created packaged solutions that can scale pretty quickly as well as customized solutions.  \n So you think about it in terms of the choice, we help them identify the best solution, compatibility, developing road maps for integration and cost and value analysis. Now in the areas of opportunity, there are 4 that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and I'll just emphasize those, and then I'll talk about where we're seeing pick up now and what we anticipate going forward.  \n First, in workforce, think productivity tools and assistance. We're the leader here with regard to many of our partners, and there is much interest in workforce AI impact currently. High-value use cases, think horizontal and aligned personas, things like security and customer experience, chatbots that can be deployed horizontally across many of our customers. Think broad-scale vertical applications where they're deeply verticalized and multidimensional and then the full stack infrastructure to underpin the applications and solutions. \n Now we are leveraging our deep partner relationships to understand and use our customer knowledge to influence our road maps, very similar to what we've done in the past, whether it's cloud or security and to bring to market products that are suitable for -- fit for certain customers. We're expanding our engineering and services capabilities. We're partnering with innovative AI start-ups. And we're developing our own internal experience, which helps us operationally but builds credibility with our customers.  \n Where we sit now, Adam, is primarily a services engagement. We have a lot of activity around those 2 solutions, MOAT discovery that I mentioned. And typically, in those we're finding that customers come to find that their data is not in the shape that it needs to be. And that leads to engagement around data and data governance and data security, et cetera. Over time, we would expect the arc of AI to move from the application layer and the services that we're providing through to inference at the edge and then into the data center.  \n But it's going to be a journey, and we're in the early innings. And we've seen this before play out. We certainly feel absolutely confident that it will be a full stack play and that our strategy and the strength of the partnerships is going to -- we're positioned and are already capturing the ability to navigate our customers through the journey. \nAdam Tindle: Yes. Complexity is typically good for CDW. That makes sense. Just a quick follow-up, Al, on guidance. The gross profit dollar for Q2 where you talked about low single-digit year-over-year growth. I think if I did the math on a sequential basis, it's like low double digits. And the last couple of years, it's been more like 6% to 8% sequentially, so above the last couple of years. Just given a little bit weaker-than-expected trends in Q1 and not wanting to get into that situation again in Q2, maybe just help us with how you thought about that gross profit dollar guidance in Q2? And is there anything that maybe underpins that sequential growth, whether it was maybe pushouts from Q1 or something like that? \nAlbert Miralles: Yes, sure, Adam. Happy to address that. A couple of things. First, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, look, we feel encouraged by the pipeline that we have and kind of what's out there from a customer spend perspective. And a lot of that would be more in the solutions category as we talked about. So that's number one. The thinking, Adam, is, look, if you look back over history of seasonality -- historical seasonality would be more in like the mid-teens level. And so when we take the sum of the catalysts that Chris mentioned upfront, that is the workload and data growth, the need on the security front and obsolescence of client devices. \n We think that there's both catalyst there, but also kind of an existing tangible pipeline that we see. And so when you add that together and you think about the context of historical seasonality in the more mid-teens, our Q2 outlook would actually be short of that seasonality modestly, and we think that knowing that Q1 was a slower start, there's a decent pipeline there, and we know that ultimately, our customers have to get back to these critical spend items. We have confidence in ability to get to that level from a seasonality perspective in the second quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. \nSamik Chatterjee: I guess, Chris, I sort of appreciate all your comments about what you're seeing in terms of a challenging sort of customer spending environment. I'm just more curious when I contrast this to last year. Obviously, the challenges or some of the scrutiny on budgets isn't new. But through last year, we did see sort of solutions remaining quite robust, and it was more the transactional business that was sort of impacted. \n So as you now are starting to see the transaction business open up a bit with the solutions business pullback, any sort of insights or sort of read into -- sort of what the change in customer thinking is? Or what we might be able to see in terms of recovery in that solutions business from the insights you have from the transaction business as well? Just curious on that, and I have a quick follow-up. \nChristine Leahy: Yes. Let me start on that one. I think what we're seeing now is we talked about the macro environment and the added complexity now of AI as a consideration and as our customers this year are continuing on that kind of pause in deliberation added to it the AI factor, if you will. They are also faced with the need to refresh client devices. And so I tell you what I think we're seeing is a need to go ahead and spend budget on things that they really can't hold off on any more. They'd like to -- they have old devices. They'd like to get over to the new operating system. They want to make sure the devices are available as demand will start to pick up and there's some switching of the budget over to the devices right now. I think that's a behavior we certainly are seeing. In terms of the trend as we go through the year, I'll let Al speak to the outlook and our expectation regarding the outlook. \nAlbert Miralles: Yes, sure. A couple of things I would mention. When we think about the parallel to 2023, look, a year later, a lot of the caution and concern that we experienced has persisted, and I would say, to some extent, in Q1, became even more heightened. And look, there is a mixed story on the economy, but when you think about the financial aspects intra-quarter, we went from an expectation in the market of a number of rate cuts to the potential of now just a few. So there's been quite the whipsaw effect just to give that kind of backdrop, if you will, that is the economic and financial environment continues to get more complicated, Samik, for sure. \n The other element I would add is on the solutions front a year later, notwithstanding those comments about macro uncertainty persisting. We've got several categories that obviously have gone through pretty significant market transitions and digestion of capacity. And really, it all points back to as the clock moves forward, we get closer and closer to those catalysts that we talked about, that is need for network modernization, need to address workload and data growth and so our confidence on the solutions front is that ultimately, customers will have to act on those things. And I would say, our pipeline reflects a lot of those intended actions just the space that we're in right now is customers are deferring, taking longer, have more decision-makers to get to that solution spend but we know that it's out there. \n So that would be how I compare the different periods. Look, hopefully, we'll get more economic and financial clarity that will assist. Hopefully, we'll get further down the path of customers thinking about what their IT road maps will look like in this era of AI. And then we do believe that we would see more balanced spending across both solutions and transactions. \nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. And Al, a quick follow-up for you. Just in terms of expectations for the gross margin as we progress through the year, you sort of get to 21.8% in 1Q, you're guiding to a similar number for the full year. Is it going to be pretty similar through all 4 quarters as you sort of see solutions spend improving maybe through the year, but client devices being a headwind on that margin? Like how should we think about progression here? \nAlbert Miralles: Sure, Samik. For the full year, I would say, we're holding to our expectation on gross margin that we gave, which was that it would be similar to 2023 all in. I think there's going to probably be some variability quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, most notably driven by mix, but at this juncture, we would hold to those expectations. Certainly, given that the mix has shifted a bit in Q1 and we saw stronger client device growth and less solutions, you'd expect that, that would have some impact on our gross margin. But I would say when we think about the contribution of netted-down revenue, which we think is durable that's helped to hold those margins. And so at this juncture, we're holding to that expectation of that kind of high 21s gross margin similar to 2023. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I have, I guess, a question and a follow-up as well. When you folks talked about the hardware categories, one of the things that really stood out was storage performance was fairly good. I'm curious like historically speaking, the storage seems to be a leading indicator for what you see eventually with NetComm and servers or not. I'd love to kind of understand from a software perspective is storage is a better indicator. And then maybe related to that, the NetComm weakness, do you think it's more inventory digestion at this point? Or is it really demand is weak? \nChristine Leahy: Amit, it's Chris. I think what we're seeing with storage right now are a confluence of 2 things. One, we had a number of customers who are investing in networking and implementing networking over the last few years and storage is kind of coming -- storage kind of what's the next investment, if you will. So we're seeing positive results there. The other thing is we've got some new exciting products out in the market, and that's always appealing to our customers. So that's really what I think is driving the storage growth in this period. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess, Al, just for you on capital allocation, the buybacks were fairly minimal in the quarter given how the free cash flow generation was and the fact that leverage is towards the lower end of the 2 to 3x range that you folks talk about. How do we think about buybacks for the rest of the year? And is the intent to perhaps show up some capital or cash for the debt paydown that you might have to do by the end of this year and early next year? Or would you use it for buybacks? \nAlbert Miralles: Look, we will continue to do what we've done in terms of balancing both the strategic and tactical elements on the capital allocation front. And I think, look, I think 2023 is probably a good guidepost for you in terms of what that looks like. At any given time, we're going to look at all the elements of the -- what's going to provide the best short-term return, how do we feel about the valuation front, and where do we get the most strategic value. I think the opportunity for us on it in 2024 is we'll continue to be patient and opportunistic. But with $800 million of cash on the balance sheet, I'd say, pretty consistent track record here of cash flow generation. \n We feel like we've got plenty of opportunity and optionality to be able to create value across all 4 of the priorities in our capital allocation scheme. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. \nMatthew Sheerin: Chris, I hope you can elaborate more on what you're seeing in the government sectors. You talked about budget-related pushouts in federal. So -- and I know there's obviously some seasonality, particularly in the September quarter. So what should we expect in terms of the seasonality across those markets? \nChristine Leahy: Yes. On federal, I'd tell you that the federal budget delay, which was about -- pushes things out by about 6 to 8 weeks, creates a pretty much a complete pause. But once the budget was implemented, then the trickle-down effect starts to happen and the money is making its way to the agencies. We have seen, I'll call it, very strong activity in both projects and programs that were ready to go, and that's been a positive and very strong activity and those that will take a little while to get through the pipeline.\n So what I would say, Matt, is as we think about seasonality back to the full year landing more on what you'd see as a federal seasonal year with it being more back-end loaded. And remember, sometimes when you get pushed out by a quarter or so in terms of the government decision-making, oftentimes, you just need to get the PON by the end of the year. So it's possible we see some of it pushed even into the following year that January sometimes happens. But what I would just tell you is, we knew it was coming. We've been working with the customers, poised to start moving the orders, and I feel quite good around federal playing out seasonally for the year. \nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, concerning the client device demand that you're starting to see pick up, are you seeing any interest or traction on AI-enabled PCs yet? Or is that still early? \nChristine Leahy: Matt, I would say it's still early. And when we look at the units that we're selling now, really minimally AI PCs. They're the Win 11 and Apple next generation. And the impetus is really threefold. It's just refresh aging machines get to Win 11, frankly. And it's also an interest in getting ahead of any increasing demand. We are finding customers having longer memories when it comes to the pandemic and remembering that sometimes just in time doesn't work because you got to stay ahead of the supply. So that's also been a factor in the positive signs that we're seeing. I'd also say, look, I mentioned it before, it's a low-friction purchase and it's kind of no regrets. When you put together aging machines, the need for Win 11 with that kind of stable landscape, customers are just starting to move forward. \n The AI PCs will come. There is interest. There's a lot of talk with customers, a lot of talk around which personas are they best going to be used for. But right now, what we're -- what our partners are providing have ample compute power to handle the AI that is in current form. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. \nErik Woodring: Chris, maybe I'd love if you could maybe unpackage some of your pipeline comments a bit more. Outside of federal, if we put that to the side, you mentioned broad pushouts. But can you maybe clarify anything you're seeing in terms of customer set or products where you're seeing this behavior most acutely? Are you seeing any cancellations is to push up behavior this quarter, any more notable than past quarters? And is it as simple as the macro is the key factor here that can unlock this spend? Or are there any other factors that you see here when you speak to your clients, where they say, listen, we just have to refresh these devices, for example, where we have to modernize our data center infrastructure? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nChristine Leahy: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. Let me just start with where you ended. And I would say, as we've suggested, the macro overhang really is the predominant factor in the extended and elongated sales cycles. What we're not seeing is we're not seeing cancellations. We're seeing just more deliberation and greater time and more involvement, frankly, by more business unit constituents in the decision-making process. And as I said, the AI consideration is a real thing. It's a bit of a pause. How do we think about this over the long term? As you know, the progress, the speed with which AI functionality is moving is really fast and they're taking that into consideration. \n But I would say that the -- it feels very similar to 2023. And as Al mentioned, I mean, this quarter, we created more uncertainty in some ways than we saw in certain quarters last year. So it's not that dissimilar. And it really does have to do across what I'll call, complex solution sets. Remember, we don't really have customers buying point products per se. We are seeing in some areas of server, for example, refresh. We're just at the point where customers need to refresh, and we're figuring out how to do that or potentially starting to move some things to cloud. But I would just characterize it very similar to the trend from last year. \nAlbert Miralles: And maybe, Erik, just adding on to that and to kind of stitch the story together. We talk about these catalysts. Within those catalysts are plenty of opportunities from a solutions perspective. I think that what we saw transpire is this kind of heightened caution and concern kind of the -- as you can see what's around the corner phenomenon, if you will, from a corporate perspective just caused more delay in deliberation. \n And then to Chris' point, you add on AI and the complexity of the -- what is it ultimately going to mean for these customers' infrastructure environments, and it's just more impetus to say, let's take a little time. And I think the corollary there, Erik, would be that we had a pickup in client device, and it was literally across our end markets. And so we would have said that, that was a catalyst that was out there, and that was a catalyst that started to see some free up, call it modest but some free up of spend in that regard because despite it being a catalyst kind of been held back before, it really was the lowest friction choice for customers. And so that's how the quarter played out. \nChristine Leahy: Yes. And I would just add that the durable categories we've seen over the last several quarters are security and cloud. \nErik Woodring: Okay, very helpful. And then just maybe a clarification, quick follow-up is, you mentioned expectations at least for 2024, U.S. IT market growth to be relatively similar. You did guide to low single-digit gross profit growth versus low to mid-single-digit growth last quarter. So that would presume weak gross margins would be a bit weaker than when you guided 90 days ago, but Al, you reiterated kind of the expectation for similar gross margins to 2023. So can you just help me maybe on package what is the main factor that is causing the gross profit dollar? The slight change in gross profit dollar growth guidance for 2024? And that's it for me. \nAlbert Miralles: Yes, Erik, a couple of things. So look, from just working from the -- from a customer spend perspective, we're calling for low single digits plus our typical premium. So that's come off a bit. And if it were coming off in a category, that would probably be substantially from a solutions perspective. That is the slow start that we experienced in Q1. We're not suggesting we're going to make that up. So that comes off the top. And then that's basically just kind of works its way down to GP. We're getting an earlier start to client device, at least for the first quarter than maybe we would have anticipated. \n So while that doesn't help from a gross margin perspective, it certainly does help from a gross profit perspective, right, because you're getting the volume. And I think if you look down our P&L for the quarter, you'd see the delta on net sales was closer because we saw more from a client device perspective. So there are some puts and takes within that. But I'd say, we're in the range of -- with solutions being a little lighter, client being a little stronger and frankly, continued durability of netted-down revenues, there's not much of a change there on the gross margin front. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Vogt from UBS. \nDavid Vogt: I just want to come back to maybe a longer-term kind of discussion on AI and some of your hardware categories. As you guys look out maybe beyond this year into '25 as traction starts to really accelerate in AI, how are you thinking about sort of the uplift in maybe configurations, ASPs? And how does that flow through your business? So for example, obviously, AI PC, there's a lot of discussion of having considerably higher price points. The same obviously holds true, I think, with AI-enabled optimized servers. So just trying to think about how you're thinking about that as it impacts your business, maybe not this year but in '25? \nAlbert Miralles: Yes, David, I'll take this. Look, I think TBD, to some extent, right, we're going to see how pricing plays out. What I would tell you is in current context, we're not seeing much in the way of ASP changes. I'd say prices broadly, including on the client device front, held pretty firm. So our growth during the quarter was largely units. Certainly, there is plenty of buzz out there that as we start to see AI PCs and other AI categories emerge that you could see price increases. But I'm not sure that we're fully prepared to kind of call on what that would look like. Just remember for us, look, we're going to work closely with our customers as we are now, and we'll continue to in terms of how do you navigate that landscape, how do we help them get in front of it to the extent that they can. But also remember that for us in terms of kind of impacts, any lift there on the ASPs may lift the top line but we're largely still very much a cost-plus provider, so you may not see significant movement from a gross margin perspective. \nDavid Vogt: Got it. So just to clarify, obviously, wouldn't be subject to ASC fixed accounting, these would be grossed up revenue and then the commensurate gross profit dollars associated with the revenue, correct? Is the right way to think about it? \nAlbert Miralles: As we understand it now, and what the new product generations would look like, I think that's true. \nOperator: We currently have no further questions. I will hand it back over to Chris Leahy, Chair and CEO, for final remarks. \nChristine Leahy: Thank you. And let me close by reemphasizing my confidence in this team, our strategy and the durability of our resilient business model. Thank you to our CDW coworkers across the globe for your unwavering commitment to our customers. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Miralles",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will start my prepared remarks with detail on our first quarter performance, move to capital allocation priorities and then finish with our 2024 outlook.  \n Turning to the first quarter. We began 2024 experiencing the same uneven IT market conditions that we faced throughout last year. Caution on uncertainty range, high interest rates and growing pessimism towards the timing of rate cuts but deals under even greater scrutiny and ultimately led to the dampening of capital investment. \n Customers are evaluating, optimizing their IT spending. And while we actively partner with them to build out tech road maps to support their strategies, the overhang of economic and financial uncertainties as the delay in deliberation and ultimate decision-making, exacerbating elongated sales cycles. During the quarter, we were able to capitalize on demand for client devices as some customers could no longer postpone refresh activity with sales of more complex solutions tied to digital transformation and network modernization were weaker.  \n Notwithstanding, we see the potential for both client device refresh activity to continue and for improved future conversion of our solid solutions pipeline. Moving on to the specific results. First quarter gross profit was $1.1 billion, down 2.4% versus prior year and below our original expectations for low single-digit growth for the quarter. \n Consolidated first quarter net sales of $4.9 billion were down 4.5% versus prior year on a reported and average daily sales basis. Gross margin increased roughly 50 basis points year-over-year and partially offset the impact of lower net sales. Gross margin of 21.8% was a first quarter record and was broadly in line with both full year 2023 levels and our expectations for 2024.  \n First quarter margin expansion was primarily driven by higher mix in netted-down revenues. This category grew by 6%, once again outpacing overall net sales growth and representing 35.1% of our gross profit compared to 32.3% in the prior year first quarter as our teams were successful serving customers with cloud and SaaS-based solutions. While we continue to expect the mix of netted-down revenues to be an important and durable trend within our business, it is important to recognize that this mix may fluctuate with customer priorities and product demand.  \n However, even with a higher mix of client devices, margins remained firm in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. First quarter gross profit was down 7.8% compared to the fourth quarter on a reported basis. On a sequential average daily sales basis, first quarter net sales decreased 4.4%. While first quarter net sales and gross profit are typically lower than the fourth quarter, we had anticipated a more modest sequential decline as early 2024 customer engagement suggested more balanced spending across categories than we ultimately experienced.  \n Instead, the sequential decline this quarter was more in line with traditional seasonality, reflecting continued uncertain conditions impacting the spend of our corporate customers in addition to the congressional budget for laying spending of federal customers. \n Turning to expenses for the first quarter. Non-GAAP SG&A totaled $660 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. Expenses were consistent with the expectation we shared on our last earnings call, with the first quarter higher than the fourth quarter as we reset some of our variable expenses for the year and accrue for other seasonally higher items. This played out as expected, but our expense efficiency ratio was further elevated due to our lower gross profit production for the quarter.  \n As we scroll forward, we continue to manage discretionary expenses prudently and diligently while balancing this against both our expectations for the year and the need to expand our capabilities and drive future growth. Our discipline was also reflected in our coworker count at the end of the first quarter, which was approximately 15,000 and down slightly relative to year-end 2023. \n Customer-facing coworker count was also unchanged at approximately 10,900. As we expand our solutions and services capabilities, we are concurrently driving efficiency and cost leverage from our broader operations intended to fund these investments.  \n Following along on Slide 8, we delivered non-GAAP operating income of $404 million, down 7.1% versus the prior year driven by the combination of our gross profit shortfall and flat expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.3% was down 20 basis points from the prior year. As reflected on Slide 9, our non-GAAP net income was $261 million in the quarter, down 6.4% on a year-over-year basis. With first quarter weighted average diluted shares of approximately 136 million, non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.92 was down 5.5% year-over-year.  \n Moving ahead to Slide 10. At period end, net debt was $4.8 billion. Net debt declined by approximately $230 million from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting our increased cash position alongside modest debt repayment during the quarter. Liquidity remains strong with cash plus revolver availability of approximately $2.1 billion.  \n Moving to Slide 11. The 3-month average cash conversion cycle was 16 days, down 2 days from the prior year and slightly below our target range of high teens to low 20s. Our cash conversion reflects our effective management of working capital particularly with respect to our inventory levels. As we've mentioned in the past, timing and market dynamics will influence working capital in any given quarter or year. \n We continue to believe our target cash conversion range remains the best guidepost for modeling working capital longer term. Despite profit that was moderately lower than our expectations, effective working capital management drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $364 million, as shown on Slide 12. Over the last 12 months, adjusted free cash flow was 104% of non-GAAP net income, well above our stated rule of thumb of 80% to 90%. As we've mentioned in the past, timing will impact adjusted free cash flow throughout the year, but we're pleased with our first quarter performance, and we'll continue to update our outlook on this front as the year plays out.  \n For the quarter, we utilized cash consistent with our 2024 capital allocation objectives, including returning approximately $83 million to shareholders through dividends and $52 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to our target to return 50% to 75% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in 2024.  \n That brings me to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 13. Our first capital priority is to increase the dividend in line with non-GAAP net income. Last November, we announced a 5% increase of our dividend to $2.48 annually, our tenth consecutive year of increasing the dividend. We will continue to target a 25% payout ratio in 2024 growing the dividend in line with earnings. \n Our second priority is to ensure we have the right capital structure in place with a targeted net leverage ratio. We ended the first quarter at 2.3x, down from 2.4x at the end of 2023 and within our targeted range of 2 to 3x. We will continue to manage liquidity while maintaining flexibility.  \n Finally, our third and fourth capital allocation priorities of M&A and share repurchases remain important drivers of shareholder value. We currently have over $1 billion of availability under our share repurchase program. And that leads us to our outlook on Slide 14. The uncertain market conditions we operated under throughout 2023, have persisted into 2024, and customer sentiment remains cautious and prudent. \n Last quarter, we spoke about a slow start to the year for 2024 IT spending, which has come to fruition and will likely continue in the near-term. However, as we look forward, we continue to see a compelling need to address cloud workload growth, increasing security threats, aging client devices and All Things Data, as we help our customers build out their plans to leverage AI and capture insights and achieve their productivity aspirations.  \n Our updated full year 2024 expectation is for low single-digit gross profit growth, reflecting the slower start to the year. We maintain our view that customers will spend their IT budgets in the upcoming quarters, but within the context of historical seasonality. With this also comes an unchanged expectation for 2024 gross margin to be similar to the full year 2023. \n Finally, we expect our full year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be up low single digits year-over-year. Please remember that we hold ourselves accountable for delivering our financial outlook on a full year constant currency basis. Additional modeling thoughts for annual depreciation and amortization, interest expense and the non-GAAP effective tax rate can be found on Slide 15.  \n Moving to modeling thoughts for the second quarter, we anticipate low single-digit gross profit growth compared to the prior year. With no change to our expectation that gross margin will be comparable to full year 2023 and Q1 2024. Our first half/second half split is slightly more weighted to the second half than historical levels in keeping with our expectation for the market. However, we still anticipate seasonal quarterly patterns to reasonably hold, including a lower fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. \n Moving down the P&L. We expect second quarter operating expenses to be moderately higher than the second quarter of 2023 on a dollar basis, but reflecting a more normalized ratio relative to gross profit than we experienced in Q1. \n Finally, we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth to be in the low single-digit range year-over-year. For 2024, we're maintaining our expectation for adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 90% of our non-GAAP net income, assuming a higher level of working capital investments to support growth.  \n That concludes the financial summary. As always, we'll provide updated views on the macro environment and our business on our future earnings calls.  \n And with that, I will ask the operator to open it up for questions. We would ask each of you to limit your questions to one with a brief follow-up. Thank you. Yes, sure, Adam. Happy to address that. A couple of things. First, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, look, we feel encouraged by the pipeline that we have and kind of what's out there from a customer spend perspective. And a lot of that would be more in the solutions category as we talked about. So that's number one. The thinking, Adam, is, look, if you look back over history of seasonality -- historical seasonality would be more in like the mid-teens level. And so when we take the sum of the catalysts that Chris mentioned upfront, that is the workload and data growth, the need on the security front and obsolescence of client devices. \n We think that there's both catalyst there, but also kind of an existing tangible pipeline that we see. And so when you add that together and you think about the context of historical seasonality in the more mid-teens, our Q2 outlook would actually be short of that seasonality modestly, and we think that knowing that Q1 was a slower start, there's a decent pipeline there, and we know that ultimately, our customers have to get back to these critical spend items. We have confidence in ability to get to that level from a seasonality perspective in the second quarter. Yes, sure. A couple of things I would mention. When we think about the parallel to 2023, look, a year later, a lot of the caution and concern that we experienced has persisted, and I would say, to some extent, in Q1, became even more heightened. And look, there is a mixed story on the economy, but when you think about the financial aspects intra-quarter, we went from an expectation in the market of a number of rate cuts to the potential of now just a few. So there's been quite the whipsaw effect just to give that kind of backdrop, if you will, that is the economic and financial environment continues to get more complicated, Samik, for sure. \n The other element I would add is on the solutions front a year later, notwithstanding those comments about macro uncertainty persisting. We've got several categories that obviously have gone through pretty significant market transitions and digestion of capacity. And really, it all points back to as the clock moves forward, we get closer and closer to those catalysts that we talked about, that is need for network modernization, need to address workload and data growth and so our confidence on the solutions front is that ultimately, customers will have to act on those things. And I would say, our pipeline reflects a lot of those intended actions just the space that we're in right now is customers are deferring, taking longer, have more decision-makers to get to that solution spend but we know that it's out there. \n So that would be how I compare the different periods. Look, hopefully, we'll get more economic and financial clarity that will assist. Hopefully, we'll get further down the path of customers thinking about what their IT road maps will look like in this era of AI. And then we do believe that we would see more balanced spending across both solutions and transactions. Sure, Samik. For the full year, I would say, we're holding to our expectation on gross margin that we gave, which was that it would be similar to 2023 all in. I think there's going to probably be some variability quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, most notably driven by mix, but at this juncture, we would hold to those expectations. Certainly, given that the mix has shifted a bit in Q1 and we saw stronger client device growth and less solutions, you'd expect that, that would have some impact on our gross margin. But I would say when we think about the contribution of netted-down revenue, which we think is durable that's helped to hold those margins. And so at this juncture, we're holding to that expectation of that kind of high 21s gross margin similar to 2023. Look, we will continue to do what we've done in terms of balancing both the strategic and tactical elements on the capital allocation front. And I think, look, I think 2023 is probably a good guidepost for you in terms of what that looks like. At any given time, we're going to look at all the elements of the -- what's going to provide the best short-term return, how do we feel about the valuation front, and where do we get the most strategic value. I think the opportunity for us on it in 2024 is we'll continue to be patient and opportunistic. But with $800 million of cash on the balance sheet, I'd say, pretty consistent track record here of cash flow generation. \n We feel like we've got plenty of opportunity and optionality to be able to create value across all 4 of the priorities in our capital allocation scheme. And maybe, Erik, just adding on to that and to kind of stitch the story together. We talk about these catalysts. Within those catalysts are plenty of opportunities from a solutions perspective. I think that what we saw transpire is this kind of heightened caution and concern kind of the -- as you can see what's around the corner phenomenon, if you will, from a corporate perspective just caused more delay in deliberation. \n And then to Chris' point, you add on AI and the complexity of the -- what is it ultimately going to mean for these customers' infrastructure environments, and it's just more impetus to say, let's take a little time. And I think the corollary there, Erik, would be that we had a pickup in client device, and it was literally across our end markets. And so we would have said that, that was a catalyst that was out there, and that was a catalyst that started to see some free up, call it modest but some free up of spend in that regard because despite it being a catalyst kind of been held back before, it really was the lowest friction choice for customers. And so that's how the quarter played out. Yes, Erik, a couple of things. So look, from just working from the -- from a customer spend perspective, we're calling for low single digits plus our typical premium. So that's come off a bit. And if it were coming off in a category, that would probably be substantially from a solutions perspective. That is the slow start that we experienced in Q1. We're not suggesting we're going to make that up. So that comes off the top. And then that's basically just kind of works its way down to GP. We're getting an earlier start to client device, at least for the first quarter than maybe we would have anticipated. \n So while that doesn't help from a gross margin perspective, it certainly does help from a gross profit perspective, right, because you're getting the volume. And I think if you look down our P&L for the quarter, you'd see the delta on net sales was closer because we saw more from a client device perspective. So there are some puts and takes within that. But I'd say, we're in the range of -- with solutions being a little lighter, client being a little stronger and frankly, continued durability of netted-down revenues, there's not much of a change there on the gross margin front. Yes, David, I'll take this. Look, I think TBD, to some extent, right, we're going to see how pricing plays out. What I would tell you is in current context, we're not seeing much in the way of ASP changes. I'd say prices broadly, including on the client device front, held pretty firm. So our growth during the quarter was largely units. Certainly, there is plenty of buzz out there that as we start to see AI PCs and other AI categories emerge that you could see price increases. But I'm not sure that we're fully prepared to kind of call on what that would look like. Just remember for us, look, we're going to work closely with our customers as we are now, and we'll continue to in terms of how do you navigate that landscape, how do we help them get in front of it to the extent that they can. But also remember that for us in terms of kind of impacts, any lift there on the ASPs may lift the top line but we're largely still very much a cost-plus provider, so you may not see significant movement from a gross margin perspective. As we understand it now, and what the new product generations would look like, I think that's true."

            "name": "Christine Leahy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a brief overview of our performance, our strategic progress and view for the balance of the year. Al will provide additional details on our results, our capital allocation priorities and our outlook. We'll move quickly through our prepared remarks to ensure we have plenty of time for questions. Market conditions remained challenging, and first quarter results came in below our expectations. \n For the quarter, gross profit was $1.1 billion, 2% lower than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $404 million, down 7%, and non-GAAP net income per share was $1.92, down 6%. \n In the first quarter, customers demonstrated caution and concern given heightened macro uncertainty, weighing on capital investment decisions. At the same time, the complexities of the tech landscape continued to ratchet up, particularly given the additional layer of AI and changes in the IT market landscape. This lengthened decision-making as customers deliberated on both how to navigate technology road map and when to spend on infrastructure in a challenging economic environment. While activity was reflected in a solid pipeline with deals being pushed out, our sales and gross profit lagged.  \n Results were also impacted by the federal budget stalemate, which led to a pause in our federal channel. Bottom line, while many of these factors are beyond our control, we are never satisfied. And as we do not expect decision cycles to improve in the near term, we remain focused on accelerating pipeline growth and using all of our competitive advantages to take share in this low-growth environment.  \n During the quarter, our teams maintained a high level of engagement, working with customers to implement mission-critical projects, help prioritize and evaluate options, develop multiyear plans and prove out use cases. You see the impact of this in our gross margin, which was a first quarter record and our excellent cash flow, which together reinforce the durability of our underlying profitability and integrity of our strategies. Whatever the market condition, we are laser-focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers. To ensure we continue to deliver on this commitment, we remain resolute in our strategy and continue to invest to ensure we have the capabilities to deliver full stack solutions and services.  \n Broadly speaking, customer priorities included cost optimization, data protection and workforce productivity. This drove focus on security, cloud and as a service as well as client demand and interest in AI. Let's take a look at how all of these priorities impacted performance. \n First, customer end market performance. Recall, we have 5 sales channels: corporate, small business, health care, government and education end markets, each a meaningful business on its own with 2023 annual sales ranging from $1.6 billion to $9 billion. Within each channel, the teams are further segmented to focus on customer end markets, including geography and verticals. \n Our commercial operations are organized around geographies, verticals, customer size and spend. Teams are similarly segmented in our U.K. and Canadian operations, which together delivered USD 2.6 billion in 2023 sales. These unique customer end markets often act in a countercyclical way given the different macroeconomic and external factors that impact each of them. Corporate top line declined 3% year-over-year. Decision-making further elongated with heightened focus on ROI and a high level of project scrutiny, given interest rate expectations.  \n Cloud and security prioritization continued to drive excellent increases in customer spend and the team capitalized on client device demand and year-over-year client sales were up low double digits. Corporate saw declines in hardware categories undergoing transition and absorbing capacity notably servers and NetComm. \n Storage, however, was a standout category up double digits, driven by data and workload growth as customers improve efficiency and capture savings from newer solutions. Small business posted a 7% year-over-year top line decline, but with sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter.  \n The team continued to help customers address mission-critical priorities around security and productivity which drove meaningful increases in cloud and software customer spend. Consistent with corporate NetComm and servers declined and storage increased. Small business continued to be accretive to overall margins. Client devices posted a sequential increase yet remained down year-over-year. \n Public sales declined 5% from the prior year. Health care declined 2%, transactional performance was positive with an increase in client devices, while solutions declined. Health care performance was similar to commercial with customer caution given the significant focus on cost optimization. Security was also a major focus area, delivering double-digit increases in spend and gross profit.  \n State and local mid-teens increase was more than offset by a decline in federal top line and total government declined 1.5%. State and local performance was broad-based with strength across transactional and solutions categories. Client devices sales increased for the third quarter in a row, up high teens. Public safety remained a key focus area with security up substantially double digits. \n Cloud adoption continued to gain traction. Federal's mid-teens decline was driven by the congressional budget impact, which was not resolved until late March. Some activity related to existing contracts continued, including client device refreshes, which drove a mid-teen increase, larger-scale network and data center projects paused. Engagement remains strong, and we expect to pick up and spend once agencies are able to allocate their appropriated funds.  \n It continues to be a challenging environment for education and the segment posted a 10% decline. Consistent with recent quarters, higher ed institutions remain focused on doing more with less, and the team posted a mid-teens top line decline. Hardware categories declined across the board, while ongoing focus on cost elasticity led to a strong double-digit increase in cloud.  \n K-12's top line decreased by high single digits. Client device sales increased by low single digits, with some school systems refreshing aged Chromebooks, several funded via normal operating budgets and not stimulus programs. Audiovisual solutions like smart whiteboards and interactive flat panels posted a substantial decline as schools continue to digest purchases from the past several years. Security remained a top priority in both top line and gross profit increased by mid-single digits. Our U.K. and Canadian international operations, which we report as Other continued to experience challenging market conditions and each declined by mid-single digits.  \n Both teams continue to execute well and are leveraging their capabilities to deliver great outcomes for our customers. For the most part, portfolio performance was consistent across customer end markets. Transactional product sales performed somewhat better than solutions and modestly increased sequentially. Both posted year-over-year declines with a greater decline in solutions from the fits and starts of decision-making. \n At the portfolio level, hardware top line decreased by 4%. Services also decreased by 4% as weakness in services tied to hardware more than offset growth in managed services, which increased by low teens. Even though software net sales declined by 7%, gross profit increased slightly year-over-year. Top line performance was driven by declines in licensed software due to accelerated transitions to SaaS models.  \n Let's turn now to the topic that is getting a lot of attention, AI, and specifically what we are doing for our customers in this space. Right now, most of our customers are at the initial stages of the assessment process, developing and analyzing use cases and adopting data governance best practices to deliver insights and ensure end-to-end security. \n Essentially, they are exploring the art of the possibility and working through the science of exactly how do we do this. This is exciting work for all of us and our customers. The complexity of adopting AI plays to our strength. We know how to bridge the gap between the promise of technology and transformational outcomes. And since deploying AI drives the need for technology investment across the full stack with entry points across the entire stack, we are uniquely positioned to serve our customers, and we are doing that today. \n To support our customers as they navigate successful AI adoption, we offer 2 broad areas of consulting services. First, connecting AI to outcomes and ROI, which we call AI discovery, and second, a practical approach to implementing AI, including data governance and security, which we call Master Operational AI Transition, or MOAT. While still early innings, these services are gaining traction.  \n We scoped the broad AI opportunity around 4 areas of focus: workforce productivity, notably end-use assistance and edge devices; high-value use cases; broad-scale vertical solutions; and full stack where customers rely on us to provide the infrastructure underlying applications and solutions. A great example of full stack is the corporate training and development, domain-specific large language model solution we shared with you last quarter. \n Our broad-scale solutions are vertically based. As you know, we have expertise across many verticals, including health care, financial services in many key industry segments, expertise that enables us to deeply understand the unique needs and challenges faced by organizations in these sectors and tailor solutions and services that directly address their opportunities and pain points.  \n Let's take a look at a couple of the vertical AI examples. First, our AI offering for the K-12 market. AI presents an exciting opportunity to empower teachers and improve learning outcomes, but it must be done very carefully. Our education team has leveraged its expertise and relationships in this field to offer a safe AI platform that is specifically designed for K-12 classroom with a custom large language model that generates responses from embedded educational content, not the entire Internet. \n The second example is a proprietary CDW health care solution, Patient Room 'Next'. While AI holds the promise of medical breakthroughs, our solution addresses the intense pressure institutions face to manage costs while sustaining high levels of patient outcomes. Our solution combines AI and connected devices to transform patient rooms, improve care delivery and enhance overall health care experiences.  \n The solution is HIPAA-compliant and runs on an end-to-end intelligent platform powered by GPUs, a platform that provides real-time insights from data and automated documentation. One current application serves over 300 beds and builds $4 million in annual licensing. Add to that, the services and equipment we provide for an end-to-end solution like cameras, network connections and servers, and you can see the opportunity this represents to deliver value for our customers and for CDW. \n Of course, AI will take time to become embedded across our entire customer set, we know that, we have been here before as we've helped our customers adopt cloud. And while the hype cycle is much shorter than cloud, the adoption is very similar. Bottom line, we are here for our customers today and will be there for them in the future as they continue to ramp their efforts. And that leads me to our thoughts on the balance of 2024.  \n You will recall that on last quarter's conference call, we shared our expectations for 2024 U.S. IT market growth in the low single digits and our target to grow 200 to 300 basis points above market. Despite the slow start to the year, we still see potential for market growth. Let me be clear that we do not expect to demand hockey stick but do see potential for client device refresh and for improved solutions performance. Wildcards include further dampening of capital investment from sustained high interest rates, worsening of geopolitical issues as well as unusual election year uncertainty.  \n As we always do, we will update our view of the market as we move through the year. A hallmark of CDW is to serve our customers wherever their priorities lie. As we look ahead, our customers face a compelling need to address cloud workload growth, protect against increasing security threats, manage an aging client device base and navigate All Things Data as they build out their plans to leverage AI to capture insights and achieve their productivity aspirations. Armed with our full stack, full outcomes, full life cycle portfolio and unique vertical expertise, no one is more prepared to help our customers successfully navigate this period of unprecedented change.  \n With that, let me turn it over to Al. If I could, let me zoom out first and then zoom back into AI. Let me just start with the environment that we experienced in Q1. There are a couple of factors that impacted results in complex solutions results. And look, we had a dynamic in a pretty complex environment that manifested in what I would call fits and starts of both the market and our customers who have lack of certainty and visibility. \n You take the first economic and financial uncertainty. In other words, the interest rate and inflation environment and that was really the primary driver of the impact for our corporate team and our small business team. And that created an overhang in the environment, which drove what I'll call an uneven market condition situation pretty similar to the trends we saw in 2023.  \n And as a result, our customers remain cautious. They remain prudent, there is relentless scrutiny on deals across the board in the solutions space, in particular, as customers focused on cost optimization and short-term ROI and ultimately, that dampened capital investment in the period. \n I'd also say to a lesser degree, AI considerations as an added complexity in the deliberation process enter the picture. We're at a real inflection point with AI, critical decision for all of our businesses, understanding what it means to their business and their workforce, what it means to their road map, technology road maps and what the implications for infrastructure are.  \n I just would highlight a couple of other pressure points during the quarter or a lesser impact, but we had some changes in the IT landscape with some consolidation and acceleration into -- as a service, which creates a natural interruption, I would say, in just the customer process. Fed budgets delayed and then the education market is transitioning really back to a more normalized funding mechanism. And the result of all of that was collectively, we had to spend deficits. \n What I would say is our engagement overall is incredibly strong. I'm really pleased with the engagement, and we are seeing that our value continues to build as we help our customers manage the complex tech environment and a dynamic period, but what didn't happen is the solid pipeline that, that translated into did not then translate into invoicing in the solutions portfolio as it would in a normal operating environment.  \n Now while we have seen the pause on the complex solutions, we are helping customers who need to refresh client actually start doing that. And that's some positive signs in what I'll call a lower risk, lower-friction client [ story ]. But at the end of the day, right, it was solutions that impacted our results overall. Now if I flip to your question on AI, here's what I'd say. \n Look, we're in the early innings. Some of our customers are advanced, but really most are in an assessment and experimentation stage, and it's going to unfold over time. CDW is uniquely positioned in the space to take advantage of what will be ubiquitous and a full stack opportunity. We know how to take customers on the journey. We've done it before, this art and science of new technologies. We've got the full stack and broad portfolio. So we can help customers at every entry point. \n And we've got services against the entire part of the stack and across the life cycle. And so we've got the ability to deliver integrated solutions. We also understand our customers' pain points and opportunities given our deep vertical expertise and our intimacy with our customers. So we have created packaged solutions that can scale pretty quickly as well as customized solutions.  \n So you think about it in terms of the choice, we help them identify the best solution, compatibility, developing road maps for integration and cost and value analysis. Now in the areas of opportunity, there are 4 that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and I'll just emphasize those, and then I'll talk about where we're seeing pick up now and what we anticipate going forward.  \n First, in workforce, think productivity tools and assistance. We're the leader here with regard to many of our partners, and there is much interest in workforce AI impact currently. High-value use cases, think horizontal and aligned personas, things like security and customer experience, chatbots that can be deployed horizontally across many of our customers. Think broad-scale vertical applications where they're deeply verticalized and multidimensional and then the full stack infrastructure to underpin the applications and solutions. \n Now we are leveraging our deep partner relationships to understand and use our customer knowledge to influence our road maps, very similar to what we've done in the past, whether it's cloud or security and to bring to market products that are suitable for -- fit for certain customers. We're expanding our engineering and services capabilities. We're partnering with innovative AI start-ups. And we're developing our own internal experience, which helps us operationally but builds credibility with our customers.  \n Where we sit now, Adam, is primarily a services engagement. We have a lot of activity around those 2 solutions, MOAT discovery that I mentioned. And typically, in those we're finding that customers come to find that their data is not in the shape that it needs to be. And that leads to engagement around data and data governance and data security, et cetera. Over time, we would expect the arc of AI to move from the application layer and the services that we're providing through to inference at the edge and then into the data center.  \n But it's going to be a journey, and we're in the early innings. And we've seen this before play out. We certainly feel absolutely confident that it will be a full stack play and that our strategy and the strength of the partnerships is going to -- we're positioned and are already capturing the ability to navigate our customers through the journey. Yes. Let me start on that one. I think what we're seeing now is we talked about the macro environment and the added complexity now of AI as a consideration and as our customers this year are continuing on that kind of pause in deliberation added to it the AI factor, if you will. They are also faced with the need to refresh client devices. And so I tell you what I think we're seeing is a need to go ahead and spend budget on things that they really can't hold off on any more. They'd like to -- they have old devices. They'd like to get over to the new operating system. They want to make sure the devices are available as demand will start to pick up and there's some switching of the budget over to the devices right now. I think that's a behavior we certainly are seeing. In terms of the trend as we go through the year, I'll let Al speak to the outlook and our expectation regarding the outlook. Amit, it's Chris. I think what we're seeing with storage right now are a confluence of 2 things. One, we had a number of customers who are investing in networking and implementing networking over the last few years and storage is kind of coming -- storage kind of what's the next investment, if you will. So we're seeing positive results there. The other thing is we've got some new exciting products out in the market, and that's always appealing to our customers. So that's really what I think is driving the storage growth in this period. Yes. On federal, I'd tell you that the federal budget delay, which was about -- pushes things out by about 6 to 8 weeks, creates a pretty much a complete pause. But once the budget was implemented, then the trickle-down effect starts to happen and the money is making its way to the agencies. We have seen, I'll call it, very strong activity in both projects and programs that were ready to go, and that's been a positive and very strong activity and those that will take a little while to get through the pipeline.\n So what I would say, Matt, is as we think about seasonality back to the full year landing more on what you'd see as a federal seasonal year with it being more back-end loaded. And remember, sometimes when you get pushed out by a quarter or so in terms of the government decision-making, oftentimes, you just need to get the PON by the end of the year. So it's possible we see some of it pushed even into the following year that January sometimes happens. But what I would just tell you is, we knew it was coming. We've been working with the customers, poised to start moving the orders, and I feel quite good around federal playing out seasonally for the year. Matt, I would say it's still early. And when we look at the units that we're selling now, really minimally AI PCs. They're the Win 11 and Apple next generation. And the impetus is really threefold. It's just refresh aging machines get to Win 11, frankly. And it's also an interest in getting ahead of any increasing demand. We are finding customers having longer memories when it comes to the pandemic and remembering that sometimes just in time doesn't work because you got to stay ahead of the supply. So that's also been a factor in the positive signs that we're seeing. I'd also say, look, I mentioned it before, it's a low-friction purchase and it's kind of no regrets. When you put together aging machines, the need for Win 11 with that kind of stable landscape, customers are just starting to move forward. \n The AI PCs will come. There is interest. There's a lot of talk with customers, a lot of talk around which personas are they best going to be used for. But right now, what we're -- what our partners are providing have ample compute power to handle the AI that is in current form. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. Let me just start with where you ended. And I would say, as we've suggested, the macro overhang really is the predominant factor in the extended and elongated sales cycles. What we're not seeing is we're not seeing cancellations. We're seeing just more deliberation and greater time and more involvement, frankly, by more business unit constituents in the decision-making process. And as I said, the AI consideration is a real thing. It's a bit of a pause. How do we think about this over the long term? As you know, the progress, the speed with which AI functionality is moving is really fast and they're taking that into consideration. \n But I would say that the -- it feels very similar to 2023. And as Al mentioned, I mean, this quarter, we created more uncertainty in some ways than we saw in certain quarters last year. So it's not that dissimilar. And it really does have to do across what I'll call, complex solution sets. Remember, we don't really have customers buying point products per se. We are seeing in some areas of server, for example, refresh. We're just at the point where customers need to refresh, and we're figuring out how to do that or potentially starting to move some things to cloud. But I would just characterize it very similar to the trend from last year. Yes. And I would just add that the durable categories we've seen over the last several quarters are security and cloud. Thank you. And let me close by reemphasizing my confidence in this team, our strategy and the durability of our resilient business model. Thank you to our CDW coworkers across the globe for your unwavering commitment to our customers. Thank you to our customers for the privilege and opportunity to help you achieve your goals. And thank you to those listening for your time and continued interest in CDW. Al and I look forward to talking to you next quarter."
