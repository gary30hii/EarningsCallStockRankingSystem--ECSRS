After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Andy Hargreaves. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thanks, Elaine. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call. I'm Andy Hargreaves, VP of investor relations. It's a pleasure to be joined today by DoorDash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements during this call, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results and guidance, strategy, long-term growth and overall future prospects as well as statements regarding litigation and regulatory matters. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Events that could cause our actual results and future actions of the company to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth under the captions Forward-looking Statements in today's investor letter and are described in our risk factors, including in our SEC filings, including our final prospectus for our initial public offering filed with the SEC on December 8, 2020. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Also note, that the forward-looking statements we make on this call are based on information available to us and assumptions and beliefs as of today's date. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial results, including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, may be found in our investor letter, which was furnished with our Form 8-K filed today with the SEC and on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website, and an audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. With that out of the way, I'd like to turn it over to Tony.\nTony Xu: Thanks, Andy, and thanks, everyone, for joining our very first earnings call. 2020 really put into focus the mission of our company and why we started this journey 7.5 years ago. We exist to grow and to empower local economies. As this is our first earnings call, I thought I'd give you a snapshot into how our team has executed this mission during the most critical times, and I'll follow by sharing a few thoughts on where we are going as we hopefully soon emerge out of this pandemic. 2020 was a difficult year for all of our audiences, and our operations made great challenges and faced enormous uncertainty. While exhausting at times, I'm proud that our team chose optimism, built plans, prepared for all scenarios and executed 24/7 to ensure that we did our part in seeing the best of our local communities. While much of the work began in March 2020, a lot of the impact was carried into Q4. We prioritized safety by shipping no contact delivery, distributed more than 10 million units of PPE in the form of hand sanitizers, gloves and masks to Dashers, and we collaborated with merchants on tamper-proof packaging. We prioritized Dashers' health by offering affordable telehealth visits with doctors, ensured financial assistance for those impacted by COVID-19, and just last week, hosted our first webinar to provide Dashers with information about the vaccine. Equally important, we became a lifeline to millions of people who saw flexible earnings opportunities, especially after furloughs and other forms of job loss. In Q4 alone, over one million Dashers earned over $2 billion in supplemental income on our platform. We reduced our commissions by half to local merchants, an investment totaling over $100 million, while funding national marketing campaigns to drive growth and add instant liquidity. We provided grants to more than nearly 2,000 local restaurants to help them adapt to the COVID winter. And by the end of Q4 2020, our analysis showed that the odds of surviving during the pandemic were eight times better for merchants on DoorDash versus all U.S. restaurants. For consumers, we accelerated our entry into the convenience and grocery categories. From September to December last year, we observed 95% growth in consumers who order from these new categories on the DoorDash marketplace. Finally, we supported our community by donating free DashPass subscriptions to healthcare workers across the country and partnered with organizations like the New York City Department of Public Schools, United Way and Feeding America to deliver food, groceries and supplies to those most in need, powering the delivery of 6.5 million meals to those in need during 2020. I want to thank all of our teams worldwide and the millions of consumers, Dashers and merchants who each stepped up in their own ways to navigate this pandemic. As we progress out of the pandemic, I thought I'd remind everyone of our long-term vision, which will take decades to build. In order to grow and empower local economies, we plan to build a marketplace and platform to enable every brick-and-mortar business to compete in today's convenience economy. The job of our marketplace is to grow in merchant sales, and we aspire to bring all of your city to you in minutes, not hours or days. Today, most of our business is in the restaurants category where we still see massive runway. We are investing to extend our category-leading position in the U.S. while doubling down on the momentum we are seeing overseas in Canada and in Australia. Outside of restaurants, we're excited about the early progress we're making after launching into the convenience and grocery categories. According to third-party data, DoorDash became the largest online convenience delivery platform in the U.S. in less than a year, demonstrating the extensibility of our platform. And this is just the beginning as we have a long way to go in building our marketplace to serve these and many other categories in the future. The job of our platform is to empower a brick-and-mortar merchant to build their own digital channel, a task necessary to have adapted to evolving consumer preferences before the pandemic and a task certainly necessary to have survived COVID-19. This business is even more critical as we come out of the pandemic as consumers have only become more habituated to a convenience economy, aided by a possible longer-term trend toward working from home. Today, merchants can use DoorDash Drive to offer on demand and same-day delivery from their own digital channels. In cases where merchants don't have an online ordering solution, they can use DoorDash Storefront, which enables them to participate in e-commerce and gives them a product that's seamlessly tied to their back-of-house systems. Over time, we will have to build even more products and services to enable merchants to run their digital business as effectively as we operate our marketplace. Underpinning our marketplace and platform is our maniacal focus on operating efficiency where we believe best-in-class execution will result in an improving cost structure that unlocks further investment capital as we grow our skin. With that, let me hand it over to Prabir.\nPrabir Adarkar: Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout our history, we've been laser-focused on our four core constituents: merchants, consumers, Dashers and our employees. And today, we are excited to welcome our fifth constituent, our shareholders. I want to take this opportunity to share how we manage the business and allocate capital. We are still early in our life cycle and believe we have substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. We intend to invest aggressively to pursue these opportunities. When navigating capital, we start small and experimented the refined product market fit. If we see strong demand with the path to unit economics and meet our thresholds, we invest incremental capital. Each project we invest in must continuously earn capital on its own merits. To date, the bulk of our investments have been made through our income statement rather than through our balance sheet, and we expect this to remain the case for the foreseeable future. We are the category leader in the U.S., but despite our scale, we see significant room for growth. Consequently, we are managing the business to maximize scale and long-term profit dollars rather than take rate or margin percentages. Impact is, this means we intend to invest aggressively into the business in order to further our growth initiatives and expand our competitive advantages. As you likely saw, we intend to provide guidance for Marketplace GOV and adjusted EBITDA going forward. We do not plan on guiding to revenue as we do not directly manage the business to this metric. In our model, revenues and output, reflecting in part dynamic decisions we make around consumer pricing, the ideal mix of advertising to promotions, our relative success with DashPass and the mix of Drive volume. We focus intently on inputs in each of these areas but will manage the business to Marketplace GOV and adjusted EBITDA dollars. We provided our guidance for Q1 and 2021 in our investor letter, but I'd like to provide a little more detail behind that. Underlying our 2021 guidance is an assumption of accelerated market reopening and a return to in-store dining. While we have seen many positive signals from consumers and markets that have temporarily reopened during the pandemic, we acknowledge that vaccination and full reopenings could drive sharper changes in consumer behavior than current data would predict. Consequently, our 2021 full-year guidance reflects this uncertainty. We are deeply hopeful that markets will reopen soon and we'll manage our business to provide exceptional experiences to merchants, consumers and Dashers in any scenario. With that, I'll open it up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, just on trends a little bit in 1Q. We've seen some signs of accelerating growth in the quarter from some of your peers. Can you just talk about kind of what you're seeing in the first quarter and how that ties into your guidance for 1Q in terms of GOV? And then secondly, can you just talk more broadly about how you're thinking about the marketing in competition in the category in the U.S. now that we've seen a degree of consolidation over the last year and reopening happening and how you view kind of rationality in the space going forward? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Doug, maybe I'll take that question. So first, in terms of the first quarter, we are seeing acceleration in January relative to our order growth in December as well as in Q4. So that answers that question. So our findings are consistent with what others have communicated. With respect to marketing and competition around that, we continue to acquire more of the new customers joining the industry in any given period. And part of what's driving that is the consistent gains we drive in our unit economics and the retention and engagement of our consumer base, which then allows us to pay higher and higher amounts in terms of CPAs to acquire customers. And so we believe it's a competitive advantage where our increasing unit economics help drive an LTV increase that then translates into an ability to acquire more customers and others.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Thanks for the chart in the letter about the marketplace versus the Drive partner store growth rate; a question about the latter. So on Drive, I think order growth was growing around 700% in mid-2020. And looking at the take rate in the fourth quarter, might have slowed down a little bit. So just -- is that true? And what percent of orders are coming from Drive at this point? And just any thoughts on the long-term outlook for that business? That's it.\nPrabir Adarkar: Ross, so let me take the second part of the question first, which is I think you were talking about take rate changes going from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Third quarter take rate was 12.1%, which reduced to 11.9% in the fourth quarter. And really the two things driving that was incremental Prop 22 cost. Remember Prop 22 passed in November, and so we have a portion of the quarter during which we had incurred those costs as well as the impact of commission caps or price controls in certain jurisdictions in Q4. So those price controls, I believe we disclosed in the letter. The net impact of revenue from the price controls was $36 million or 44 basis points. So if you add that back, you get a cleaner picture of what the actual underlying increase in the take rate was inclusive of the Prop 22 cost. On Drive, we continue to be excited by that business. Drive continues to grow strongly, faster than the core marketplace, and Drive orders grew both quarter on quarter as well as on a year-on-year basis. The thing that's interesting about Drive is about a year ago, we were largely concentrated in the restaurant vertical. But since then, we've diversified beyond restaurants and have now brought on to the Drive platform merchants and local businesses in other verticals, such as retail. We signed Michael's and Macy's. In pet supplies, we signed PetSmart and Petco. Within pharma delivery, the Sam's Club as well as flowers. So we continue to be excited about the growth here. We haven't disclosed exactly what percentage of Drive orders to place in this past quarter, but suffice to say, Drive continues to grow strongly both quarter on quarter and year on year and faster than the core business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys I wanted to ask a little bit more about usage. In the letter, I think you talked about improved retention from DashPass subs. And DashPass subs grew, I think, a bigger, larger part of the mix of orders. So can you talk about retention a little bit more, particularly as we think about January and trends going forward in terms of consumer behavior trends? And then any sort of insights on DashPass usage and just frequency of views would be helpful. Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Ron, yes, in terms of DashPass, we haven't disclosed the number of subs, but I will say that they have grown sequentially since our disclosure in the S-1. We continue to invest behind this because as we had explained in our S-1, DashPass Drive increased engagement among its subscribers due to the zero delivery season. So certainly an avenue for growth that's exciting to us. In terms of retention as well as engagement, we continue to see retention and engagement remain at COVID highs. In fact, engagement continues to improve, both within the DashPass product as well as among non-DashPass users of the platform. So we're seeing positive trends there. In terms of the long term, in our experience, consumer behavior tends to be sticky. So once the consumer discovered DoorDash and they've ordered from their favorite restaurants and enjoyed the benefits of on demand convenience, new habits get formed, and we believe this situation will persist over the long run. And so even when you look at markets like Texas and Georgia and Florida that reopened, that was sort of partially open, even though the pandemic in the U.S., against that backdrop, we continue to see our weekly order volumes in these markets continue to grow. So that's a promising sign. I suspect your question is sort of heading into a guidance question. So maybe I'll address that right now, which is embedded in our guidance, we're assuming that as the vaccine gets fully rolled out and -- consumer behavior will start reverting back to pre-COVID levels. And so that's what embedded in the guidance, along with standard Q2, Q3 summer seasonality when people generally tend to go out versus ordering. And so you're seeing that embedded in our guidance. There's a certain amount of uncertainty with respect to what consumer behavior does post-pandemic, and we're trying to reflect that in the guidance we've provided.\nRon Josey: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry: Great. I was wondering if you could give us a bit of an update on your experiments. It's probably more than an experiment, but you're -- the work that you're doing in general merchandise, the relationship with Macy's, Bloomingdale's and others, what kind of progress you're seeing so far. And to the extent that we just came out of the holiday season where companies like Nike were being told by third-party delivery network that they could ship through them, how you see the size of that opportunity and the pace that you're going to, to try and address it.\nTony Xu: Heath, it's Tony. I'll take that question. If you can think of any silver linings of this pandemic, I think it is that every brick-and-mortar store, whether they are a restaurant or a retailer, is participating in e-commerce, sometimes exclusively in e-commerce given some of the restrictions that we saw during the past year. And for us, we really were seeing that on both sides of our business as a marketplace as well as a platform. On the marketplace front, we launched our second category of convenience item deliveries about a year ago when we announced partnerships with 7-Eleven, CVS, Walgreens and many others. And already, that has picked up quite a lot of momentum in the early progress. Again, very early, but according to third-party estimates, DoorDash already is the largest delivery platform for convenience goods in the U.S. And I think you're seeing some of the extensibility of starting with the highest frequency category of restaurants, building the biggest audience there and covering the most number of stores there, just given the nature of how many restaurants there are relative to how many other types of stores there are. That have made us be able to accelerate very, very quickly into some of these other categories. On the platform front, we've actually been delivering from a lot of these partners for a while. DoorDash Drive launched in 2017 Q1. So it's about four years old now. And Prabir mentioned some of the categories that really came into fruition in the past year, whether that be in retail as we partnered with the likes of Macy's and Michael's, pet supplies, PetSmart and Petco, or pharmacy with Sam's Club. And so I think what you're seeing is every business recognizes that omnichannel is a great thing. Every business is trying to figure out how to redo their supply chains to really meet a post-pandemic omnichannel presence, which they expect to grow. And we'll be there with them, both with our marketplace as well as our platform.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question is from Eric Sheridan from UBS.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the counter investments against the longer-term opportunities. You've talked before about geographic expansion. Can you just give us a bigger sense of the way you're thinking now post the IPO about the process of either building businesses globally or acquiring businesses globally and sort of puts and takes of both organic and inorganic growth outside your core markets?\nTony Xu: Yes, Eric, I'll take that one. Look, the goal on -- if you think about our portfolio of investments today, we are growing in our core category of restaurants, which we have -- we believe, has massive runway ahead. We're adding categories to becoming a multi-marketplace -- multicategory marketplace. We're adding products on our platform in addition to Drive and Storefront. And the fourth area is international. So our perspective on international opportunities is really taking a very long-term view and becoming a global company over the long run. And given what we've seen, even with our current footprint in Australia and Canada where we believe we gained share in 2020 and saw improvements in our unit economics, we're really liking what we've seen with our playbook. And we also like what we see in terms of some of the geographic opportunities outside of the ones we operate in, in terms of just how underpenetrated and how large some of these opportunities are, especially as we bring a multiproduct portfolio into those geographies. With respect to how we enter, obviously, we'll look at any opportunities and weigh them against our own organic efforts. So far, we like our playbook, and we'll always seek to enter markets in a differentiated way for all of the audiences.\nPrabir Adarkar: And just to add to Tony's point, I mean, I want to make sure we don't lose sight that even within the core food delivery business, the runway for growth is massive. If you compare just our GOV compared to the overall restaurant spend, we're a tiny fraction of that. So there's a lot of runway for growth just in food delivery alone. Now you tack onto the new verticals such as convenience and grocery and that further adds to our addressable market where a tiny, tiny fraction of that. So, international is definitely an important priority as an area where we certainly aspire to grow into, but even the core U.S. business have many avenues for growth, and we're relatively early in those opportunities.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much.\nOperator: And your next question is from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.\nAlex Potter: Thanks, guys. Just a question, maybe follow-on the previous discussion we were just having there. But if you were to maybe, I guess, divide management bandwidth, like the amount of brain power you're spending on these different growth opportunities right now, the various different verticals within Drive, international, I know it's easy to just say they're all important, but you go to bed at night, what are the things that you're thinking about most versus less?\nTony Xu: Yes. I'll take that. Look, certainly, we have a full plate, and it's a broad surface area. And the goal was always, over many decades, to build both a marketplace and a platform in which we can transform every brick-and-mortar business. So that aperture is -- was wide even 7.5 years ago when we started the company. The way I tend to think about this is less about which thing comes up, I guess, most often in my dreams. It's more -- do we have the right leader and are we setting up that leader with the right cross-functional team for success. And as Prabir mentioned in some of the opening remarks, a lot of these projects that we're talking about, they're in very different stages of progression. And we tend to invest, kind of, measure it to what we see, both in terms of achieving product market fit as well as just where we are in the maturation and development of that market opportunity. So it's not like -- I guess it's making sure that we always have that portfolio of investments and making sure that so long as we have the right team and the right single-threaded focus on that area that the focus is really just on that execution and nothing else.\nAlex Potter: Okay. And then, maybe another question kind of on, I guess, on the regulatory front. There's been some rumors, I guess, in the press of potentially talking to unions nationally in order to prevent sort of a state-by-state Prop 22 type fight -- legal fight. If you deal with unions onetime nationally, then maybe you can come to some sort of labor agreement, and it's kind of a one-and-done setup. Is that accurate? Are you guys having discussions like that? What are the odds something like that actually happens?\nTony Xu: Well, I think it's important to start with what it is that we want to achieve with respect to anything policy when it comes to Dashers. And for us, that always starts with what it is that Dashers want. And I think what you saw in Proposition 22 was that both politics and policies sided with the Dasher. Both sides of the aisle and California came together to support Dashers' desire to keep the flexibility that, frankly, doesn't exist in any other type of work opportunity and then paired that flexibility with greater security. And wherever there are opportunities to have discussions about how can we maintain this flexibility and really create a set of standards around it that gives portable and proportional benefits tied to this flexibility, we're happy to have those conversations. I mean if you just look at some of the outcomes that have been achieved with Prop 22, I mean, you see a 50% increase in Net Promoter Scores for Dashers post Prop 22 in the State of California. So I think this is an instance where business and policy actually achieve the outcomes -- or the outcomes actually achieved the objectives that it set out to accomplish.\nAlex Potter: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two questions, if I can. First, can you just give us an update on how you're approaching the incremental Prop 22 costs? How are they coming in versus your estimates? How are you passing along or not passing those along to consumers? And what are you seeing in the competitive environment that may inform what you do? And then I guess the second would just be on kind of active efficiency. You talked about in the letter continuing to improve. Is there an opportunity, do you feel like there's multiple years left? Or are there regions where you have strong density or other factors that might serve as a leading indicator or you could give us a sense of more mature contribution margins or regional EBITDA margins? Anything you could share there would be great.\nPrabir Adarkar: Lloyd, maybe I'll take that. So first, in terms of the Prop 22 costs, we're absorbing the vast majority of the Prop 22 costs. We are passing them along in certain instances. But for the vast majority of the cost in California, we're absorbing it in our P&L. And if you think about why we're doing it, it's first and foremost in order to benefit merchants because if we keep prices low to consumers, consumers tend to order more. Those orders ultimately benefit our merchants. And so to the extent we can continue doing so, we will. It also is consistent with our overall philosophy to manage the business to maximize scale and top line growth while maintaining discipline in EBITDA. So what's embedded in our guidance for Q1 and 2021 as a whole is an assumption that we're going to continue absorbing Prop 22 costs to the degree that we currently have. On your second question around active efficiency, I remember we had this discussion even at the time of the IPO. Our active efficiencies continue to grow obviously both year on year, but also on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And the reason for that is because active efficiency is not simply a product of the traffic that's on the streets or the waiting time at restaurants. There's a ton of product work that goes into dispatching a Dasher appropriately, ensuring batches are prepared well, ensuring wasted time at the restaurant is eliminated and so on. So we've not found the ceiling yet. And I feel good about the fact that there's continued improvements in active efficiency are possible, but we don't have at least a view in terms of where it will saturate at this point.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein: I'll ask two. Just maybe how are you thinking about driving more docks in the storefront? Obviously, there's a lot of suite out there for SMBs, but yours integrate into your whole back end. And so maybe just talk about how do you drive that adoption. Is there a certain pricing mechanisms you're using or other ways to get that out there? And then secondly, just maybe talk a bit more about kind of the cash and some of the pushback. I mean number one, any information you could share about how nonchain restaurants are kind of increasing prices -- online prices to offset fees and, just in general, that behavior and the awareness that that's kind of a pretty healthy way to kind of manage? And then can you see any way that permanent jurisdictional price caps are legal? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yes. So Jason, maybe I'll take the first part of the question. So I think the first question was on Storefront. Look, Storefront is very early. It's a little over six months old as a product, and it has grown extremely, extremely quickly since launch. And you're right, in some sense for merchants, it's a bit of a no-brainer because it already integrates with all of their back-of-house systems that we've had to do on our marketplace. On the flip side, there's a lot of work to be done, making sure that it works with a wide variety of merchants. We serve -- we're very privileged and proud to serve hundreds of thousands of businesses, but that also comes with lots of complexity in terms of their operations, their protocols, their reporting requirements and things -- and so on and so forth. And so that's really where we are. We're back to how we think about investment horizons and how we manage capital allocation. Right now, Storefront is really in the product market fit phase. And so we're just trying to create more and more features such that it can deliver more and more of the benefits that we see in our own marketplace to a merchant's own digital channel.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Jason, just on your question regarding price caps. As of the end of Q4, we were subject to price controls in 73 jurisdictions, which is up from 32 at the end of the third quarter. Now based on all the conversations we've had with city officials, these price caps are temporary in nature, and they're all tied to emergency orders that are related to in-store dining. So it's our expectation that when in-store dining resumes, these price caps will fall away. In the interim, we've begun implementing incremental consumer fees in order to recoup some of the costs related to price controls. Remember, in the long term, our mantra is to continue reducing consumer fees. And so we'll do this as long as price caps are temporary, and the fee increases will go away once the price caps drop away. But in Q4, those price caps had an impact of $36 million in terms of revenue, about 44 basis points on our take rate. And, we -- we're planning to manage to that similar dollar impact over time. In terms of the regulative permanent price caps, I don't want to comment on a hypothetical, but because based on all the conversations of that so far, all indications are that it's temporary in nature.\nJason Helfstein: And just if there's anything you want to share about maybe proportion of restaurants that are using separate pricing for online versus in-store to try to recoup fees?\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. Some restaurants are using menu inflation and price inflation in order to recoup fees. So far, again, this may be a function of the fact that in-store dining shut down and consumer price elasticity, the impact in price loss is relatively minimal. But we're hopeful that as in-store dining resumes, merchants will recognize that keeping prices consistent with their in-store is actually the right path forward because it boosts the amount of demand that's possible to that delivery channel.\nJason Helfstein: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Ralph Schackart from William Blair.\nRalph Schackart: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First, just on the annual EBITDA guidance, Prabir, that contemplates a fairly wide range between zero and $200 million or so. I know you talked about price controls as well as Prop 22, but just can you give us a sense what would drive either outcome on the low end or the high end, especially after coming off, obviously, some strong tailwinds with COVID, but off a strong 2020? And then, just maybe a follow-up on the competitive side. You talked about CAC being a little bit more expensive but within your normal range. Maybe just give a sense of how the supply side looks for drivers and your ability to continue to add merchants, particularly on the restaurant side. Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Sure. Ralph, so on your first question regarding the guidance, really, the objective there in the guidance is to ensure some level of discipline on the EBITDA line. To the extent that we're outperforming on the top line, either due to the core food business or outperformance in products such as Drive or new verticals, such as convenience, we would be toward the high end. On the other hand, we've got some interesting opportunities ahead of us, particularly as it pertains to convenience. As you likely saw, third-party data shows us as being the leader in the online convenience space, and this is after having launched that particular vertical about a year or maybe less than a year ago. And so if we start seeing incremental progress and positive signals from some of these new projects, including Storefront and Drive and other things, we're inclined to invest as long as it meets our return thresholds, in which case, we will -- we'll likely end up toward the low end of that range. Again, we're managing the business, just as a reminder, to maximize scale and top line growth, with an intent to try to land inside the range in EBITDA as opposed to try to beat EBITDA. And then on your second question with respect to the supply side, let me talk about merchants first. And with COVID and the recent pandemic, it became clear to merchants that they need a delivery channel. So merchants that weren't participating in delivery prior to the pandemic needed to get that -- deliver that quickly. And so we saw a massive influx in terms of merchants, which led to selection growth. And you can see that in the chart that we included in the shareholder letter where the selections available on the platform has continued to grow. In terms of our cost to acquire merchants has been relatively stable, the same goes on the Dasher side where you've had sort of a tale of two cities. On the one hand, you would have expected a large influxes of Dashers as a result of heightened unemployment, but that was offset to some degree by stimulus checks. Regardless of all of that, our cost to acquire Dashers have been sort of stable in terms of within the realm of where we were expecting.\nRalph Schackart: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Thanks for taking my questions. On the shareholder letter, you guys mentioned that consumer acquisition costs increased in 4Q. So is that the trend we are expecting or you're expecting going forward? And second thing, how should we think about maybe contract revenue going forward into FY '21? Is that a rising trend as well? And specifically, on advertising, can you talk about maybe what channel is working well -- very well for you, what channel that you like to improve? Any particular regions that you want to go after a little bit more aggressive? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Maybe I'll start with your first question on customer acquisition cost. To be clear, we manage our business to pay back thresholds. And so the customer acquisition cost, the CPA that we pay in order to acquire customers simply an output resulting from a payback period that we're trying to hit. And so to the extent that we continue increasing the LTV of our customer base through improved profitability, through improved engagement, through levers such as DashPass, it gives us more flexibility to increase our CPA. So, I view our increasing CAC as a feature where we're able to fund higher and higher amounts of customer acquisition in order to acquire a larger and larger share of new customers joining the industry, which then when you couple that with our industry-leading attention, needs to continue market share gains in the future. So the increase in customer acquisition costs are a choice that we're making to reinvest the profitability in our business. On the question around counter revenue, just looking at 2020 versus 2021, the -- again, we don't guide to revenue, but I would point to the fact that we have an incremental cost resulting from Prop 22 that didn't exist in 2020 for the most part. And so you will see a decrement to our take rate in 2021 as a result of that incremental Prop 22 cost, the vast majority of which we're choosing to absorb. And lastly, on the advertising front, again, we don't reference one channel over another necessarily. We're managing the business to payback periods. And so we will -- we'll flexibly deploy capital across regions, across channels as long as it hits our payback thresholds.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern from Bank of America.\nMichael McGovern: Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on maybe the trajectory of AOV versus total orders for the 2021 guidance. With AOV down five points in the fourth quarter, do you kind of expect AOV to stay in the negative territory throughout 2021? And maybe if you could also talk a little bit about the cadence for -- on a quarterly basis, do you kind of just expect seasonality to return to maybe, like, a pre-COVID level in 2021 with a normal bump in Q4?\nPrabir Adarkar: Sure. So on the first question with respect to AOV, the first thing I should clarify is if you take our GOV and divide it by total orders, remember that AOV compression in part is driven by the fact that our total orders includes Drive orders, but the value associated with the Drive order is not contained in our GOV. And so when you see deceleration in AOV, some portion of that deceleration is being caused by an increasing mix of Drive orders. So I want to make sure I clarify that. Second, having said that, if I just look at our marketplace orders alone, AOVs remain above pre-COVID levels, but not massively above pre-COVID levels, that continued sort of normalizing over the course of the -- of 2020. They were at a high in Q2 and so has continued normalizing since then, but it's still modestly above pre-COVID levels. And we expect continued moderation over the course of 2021. On your question on seasonality, what I'd say is what was embedded into our guidance is an assumption that the vaccine will be broadly available soon and that in-store dining will resume relatively soon. And as a result, starting from Q2 onwards, we're going to see a reversion toward pre-COVID behavior within the customer base. That includes a reversion in terms of AOVs as well as order frequency, and that's compounded by the traditional seasonality you see around the summertime where order frequencies are impacted as consumers can get out more and go to restaurants a lot more. To the extent the consumer behavior remains propped up as a result of a delay in the vaccine or other factors, obviously, we'll perform to the upside.\nMichael McGovern: Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question is from Youssef Squali from Truist.\nYoussef Squali: Thank you very much. Two quick questions from me, please. Starting with just your -- I know you're not guiding to revenues per se. But since you are going to GOVs, I was wondering, as you look out, not just for 2021, but beyond, say, the next 5-plus years, how do you see your take rate over time evolving? Is there a point at which you kind of prefer not to have it go above certain thresholds because then it just creates so much friction with clients, with consumers, with restaurants and potentially even bring some jurisdictions even harder -- to pay a harder look at the unit economics of the business? And then maybe just look at the business internationally. As you -- I know the focus is primarily on the U.S., Australia, Canada. But as you look beyond, and there are some press articles about your interest in Japan, etc., can you just flesh out what you look at in terms of an attractiveness of a market? I think your main competitor talks about wanting to be No. 1, No. 2, and otherwise, they're not in that market. I'm not seeing that many markets where people can still be No. 1, No. 2. So maybe if you can just flesh that out for us a little bit, your strategy around international expansion beyond the three -- the other two markets you're in, that would be great. Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Great. Youssef, so let me take the question on take rate first, and then Tony can talk about international. Actually, when you think -- when we call our strategy long term, the idea is to lower commissions and fees and merchants to lower fees in consumers and to increase Dash earnings. That's the simple sort of equation that we're trying to solve for. And the way we do that is by -- on the merchant side, as we unlock greater efficiency in the P&L, whether it's through active efficiency or through eliminating waste stage or through reducing defect rates that then help our customer support costs and so on, we'll invest that both in -- on the merchant side as well as the consumer side. As an example, on the consumer side, as we keep increasing the adoption of DashPass, that has a natural deflationary impact on take rate. And although unit take rates decline, they are more than made up for the increase in engagement among DashPass consumers. And so if you look at total revenue per MAU for DashPass user versus somebody that doesn't use DashPass, the total dollars of revenue or total dollars of gross profit for DashPass consumer tend to be higher than they do for non-DashPass consumers. So, we're actively choosing to make that trade-off. And so overtime, as we unlock these efficiencies in the P&L, and as we provide merchants with additional products and services, the idea is to continuously reinvest those dollars into reducing merchant commissions, reducing consumer fees and increasing Dasher earnings because it's our belief that as we continue doing so, it will enable more adoption and we'll have access to more of the TAM that will ultimately translate into growth over the long run. Not only growth but sustained growth.\nTony Xu: Youssef, on your second question around international, I touched upon this a little bit earlier. But for us, it's really taking a really long-term view. And otherwise, candidly, we would not have launched in the United States either as we were not the first player in 2013 when we founded the company. And so I think for us, it's really looking for areas of opportunity where we can bring something of unique difference and taking a pretty long-term view on what it is that we can do for all of the audiences, consumers, merchants and Dashers. And I mean, if you look at some of the markets, well, frankly, even in the U.S., it's still pretty early days. The penetration levels are quite low in these very large geographies, including those that have players already existing there. So for us, it's always just obsessing over the consumer, merchant and Dasher. And I think if we do that, our products will speak for themselves.\nYoussef Squali: Thanks.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Samuel Lourensz from Arete.\nSamuel Lourensz: Hi, thank you for taking the question. So firstly, could you maybe talk a little bit about your testing in DashMart, how you're thinking about the business model here, and if it can bring attractive returns to -- in excess of your thresholds? And then secondly, could you talk a little bit about your progression with order batching? And as you add new verticals, how do you envision this becoming more material in the longer term? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yes. I'll take the first question on DashPass. And I think since Prabir talked earlier about active efficiency, I'll let him take the second question on batching. With respect to DashMart, we're super excited about the DashMart business. It's, again, very early days. What turned into an experiment at the end of 2019 has been something that we've invested into 2020. And so we're certainly seeing the right input metrics to cross our investment thresholds and stage this for further capital allocation. And really, if you think about the thesis behind DashMart, it's really bringing selection to where it has not existed before. Whether that means giving merchants -- it's really a win-win for merchants and consumers. For merchants, it gives them the opportunity to bridge into certain geographies that they may want to be in but aren't currently in, in the depth or magnitude that they wish. For consumers, it's getting selection that they've never had before. I mean for example, I mean, if you think about restaurateurs, they also sell a lot of retail items, as an example, where in places like Chicago, we carry the sauces of chefs like Stephanie Izard and many others in which we're serving the restaurants on DoorDash and Caviar. We're also now serving some of their other products through DashMart. Equivalently, that's also happening in other categories as well where, again, for merchants, this is an extension to bring them beyond their four walls wherever they are. And for consumers, it's giving them selection that they've never had access to before.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. Samuel, on your question on batching, batch rates have been relatively consistent for the last -- since Q2. And so I want to make sure that we don't assume that batch rates are the only driver of active efficiency, efficiency of the logistics network. There are several other sources from a product perspective that we make progress on, which is what led to the consistent and sequential increases of -- in active efficiency over the course of the past year. It's things like eliminating wasted time that a Dasher spend in a restaurant. It's better predictions of kitchen prep time to ensure the Dasher doesn't show up at the restaurant earlier than the food might be ready and so on. So batch rates are obviously an important source for the -- beyond resource.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in queue.\nTony Xu: Great. Thanks, everyone.\nPrabir Adarkar: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Prabir Adarkar",
            "content": "Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout our history, we've been laser-focused on our four core constituents: merchants, consumers, Dashers and our employees. And today, we are excited to welcome our fifth constituent, our shareholders. I want to take this opportunity to share how we manage the business and allocate capital. We are still early in our life cycle and believe we have substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. We intend to invest aggressively to pursue these opportunities. When navigating capital, we start small and experimented the refined product market fit. If we see strong demand with the path to unit economics and meet our thresholds, we invest incremental capital. Each project we invest in must continuously earn capital on its own merits. To date, the bulk of our investments have been made through our income statement rather than through our balance sheet, and we expect this to remain the case for the foreseeable future. We are the category leader in the U.S., but despite our scale, we see significant room for growth. Consequently, we are managing the business to maximize scale and long-term profit dollars rather than take rate or margin percentages. Impact is, this means we intend to invest aggressively into the business in order to further our growth initiatives and expand our competitive advantages. As you likely saw, we intend to provide guidance for Marketplace GOV and adjusted EBITDA going forward. We do not plan on guiding to revenue as we do not directly manage the business to this metric. In our model, revenues and output, reflecting in part dynamic decisions we make around consumer pricing, the ideal mix of advertising to promotions, our relative success with DashPass and the mix of Drive volume. We focus intently on inputs in each of these areas but will manage the business to Marketplace GOV and adjusted EBITDA dollars. We provided our guidance for Q1 and 2021 in our investor letter, but I'd like to provide a little more detail behind that. Underlying our 2021 guidance is an assumption of accelerated market reopening and a return to in-store dining. While we have seen many positive signals from consumers and markets that have temporarily reopened during the pandemic, we acknowledge that vaccination and full reopenings could drive sharper changes in consumer behavior than current data would predict. Consequently, our 2021 full-year guidance reflects this uncertainty. We are deeply hopeful that markets will reopen soon and we'll manage our business to provide exceptional experiences to merchants, consumers and Dashers in any scenario. With that, I'll open it up to questions. Doug, maybe I'll take that question. So first, in terms of the first quarter, we are seeing acceleration in January relative to our order growth in December as well as in Q4. So that answers that question. So our findings are consistent with what others have communicated. With respect to marketing and competition around that, we continue to acquire more of the new customers joining the industry in any given period. And part of what's driving that is the consistent gains we drive in our unit economics and the retention and engagement of our consumer base, which then allows us to pay higher and higher amounts in terms of CPAs to acquire customers. And so we believe it's a competitive advantage where our increasing unit economics help drive an LTV increase that then translates into an ability to acquire more customers and others. Ross, so let me take the second part of the question first, which is I think you were talking about take rate changes going from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Third quarter take rate was 12.1%, which reduced to 11.9% in the fourth quarter. And really the two things driving that was incremental Prop 22 cost. Remember Prop 22 passed in November, and so we have a portion of the quarter during which we had incurred those costs as well as the impact of commission caps or price controls in certain jurisdictions in Q4. So those price controls, I believe we disclosed in the letter. The net impact of revenue from the price controls was $36 million or 44 basis points. So if you add that back, you get a cleaner picture of what the actual underlying increase in the take rate was inclusive of the Prop 22 cost. On Drive, we continue to be excited by that business. Drive continues to grow strongly, faster than the core marketplace, and Drive orders grew both quarter on quarter as well as on a year-on-year basis. The thing that's interesting about Drive is about a year ago, we were largely concentrated in the restaurant vertical. But since then, we've diversified beyond restaurants and have now brought on to the Drive platform merchants and local businesses in other verticals, such as retail. We signed Michael's and Macy's. In pet supplies, we signed PetSmart and Petco. Within pharma delivery, the Sam's Club as well as flowers. So we continue to be excited about the growth here. We haven't disclosed exactly what percentage of Drive orders to place in this past quarter, but suffice to say, Drive continues to grow strongly both quarter on quarter and year on year and faster than the core business. Ron, yes, in terms of DashPass, we haven't disclosed the number of subs, but I will say that they have grown sequentially since our disclosure in the S-1. We continue to invest behind this because as we had explained in our S-1, DashPass Drive increased engagement among its subscribers due to the zero delivery season. So certainly an avenue for growth that's exciting to us. In terms of retention as well as engagement, we continue to see retention and engagement remain at COVID highs. In fact, engagement continues to improve, both within the DashPass product as well as among non-DashPass users of the platform. So we're seeing positive trends there. In terms of the long term, in our experience, consumer behavior tends to be sticky. So once the consumer discovered DoorDash and they've ordered from their favorite restaurants and enjoyed the benefits of on demand convenience, new habits get formed, and we believe this situation will persist over the long run. And so even when you look at markets like Texas and Georgia and Florida that reopened, that was sort of partially open, even though the pandemic in the U.S., against that backdrop, we continue to see our weekly order volumes in these markets continue to grow. So that's a promising sign. I suspect your question is sort of heading into a guidance question. So maybe I'll address that right now, which is embedded in our guidance, we're assuming that as the vaccine gets fully rolled out and -- consumer behavior will start reverting back to pre-COVID levels. And so that's what embedded in the guidance, along with standard Q2, Q3 summer seasonality when people generally tend to go out versus ordering. And so you're seeing that embedded in our guidance. There's a certain amount of uncertainty with respect to what consumer behavior does post-pandemic, and we're trying to reflect that in the guidance we've provided. And just to add to Tony's point, I mean, I want to make sure we don't lose sight that even within the core food delivery business, the runway for growth is massive. If you compare just our GOV compared to the overall restaurant spend, we're a tiny fraction of that. So there's a lot of runway for growth just in food delivery alone. Now you tack onto the new verticals such as convenience and grocery and that further adds to our addressable market where a tiny, tiny fraction of that. So, international is definitely an important priority as an area where we certainly aspire to grow into, but even the core U.S. business have many avenues for growth, and we're relatively early in those opportunities. Lloyd, maybe I'll take that. So first, in terms of the Prop 22 costs, we're absorbing the vast majority of the Prop 22 costs. We are passing them along in certain instances. But for the vast majority of the cost in California, we're absorbing it in our P&L. And if you think about why we're doing it, it's first and foremost in order to benefit merchants because if we keep prices low to consumers, consumers tend to order more. Those orders ultimately benefit our merchants. And so to the extent we can continue doing so, we will. It also is consistent with our overall philosophy to manage the business to maximize scale and top line growth while maintaining discipline in EBITDA. So what's embedded in our guidance for Q1 and 2021 as a whole is an assumption that we're going to continue absorbing Prop 22 costs to the degree that we currently have. On your second question around active efficiency, I remember we had this discussion even at the time of the IPO. Our active efficiencies continue to grow obviously both year on year, but also on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And the reason for that is because active efficiency is not simply a product of the traffic that's on the streets or the waiting time at restaurants. There's a ton of product work that goes into dispatching a Dasher appropriately, ensuring batches are prepared well, ensuring wasted time at the restaurant is eliminated and so on. So we've not found the ceiling yet. And I feel good about the fact that there's continued improvements in active efficiency are possible, but we don't have at least a view in terms of where it will saturate at this point. And Jason, just on your question regarding price caps. As of the end of Q4, we were subject to price controls in 73 jurisdictions, which is up from 32 at the end of the third quarter. Now based on all the conversations we've had with city officials, these price caps are temporary in nature, and they're all tied to emergency orders that are related to in-store dining. So it's our expectation that when in-store dining resumes, these price caps will fall away. In the interim, we've begun implementing incremental consumer fees in order to recoup some of the costs related to price controls. Remember, in the long term, our mantra is to continue reducing consumer fees. And so we'll do this as long as price caps are temporary, and the fee increases will go away once the price caps drop away. But in Q4, those price caps had an impact of $36 million in terms of revenue, about 44 basis points on our take rate. And, we -- we're planning to manage to that similar dollar impact over time. In terms of the regulative permanent price caps, I don't want to comment on a hypothetical, but because based on all the conversations of that so far, all indications are that it's temporary in nature. Yes. Some restaurants are using menu inflation and price inflation in order to recoup fees. So far, again, this may be a function of the fact that in-store dining shut down and consumer price elasticity, the impact in price loss is relatively minimal. But we're hopeful that as in-store dining resumes, merchants will recognize that keeping prices consistent with their in-store is actually the right path forward because it boosts the amount of demand that's possible to that delivery channel. Sure. Ralph, so on your first question regarding the guidance, really, the objective there in the guidance is to ensure some level of discipline on the EBITDA line. To the extent that we're outperforming on the top line, either due to the core food business or outperformance in products such as Drive or new verticals, such as convenience, we would be toward the high end. On the other hand, we've got some interesting opportunities ahead of us, particularly as it pertains to convenience. As you likely saw, third-party data shows us as being the leader in the online convenience space, and this is after having launched that particular vertical about a year or maybe less than a year ago. And so if we start seeing incremental progress and positive signals from some of these new projects, including Storefront and Drive and other things, we're inclined to invest as long as it meets our return thresholds, in which case, we will -- we'll likely end up toward the low end of that range. Again, we're managing the business, just as a reminder, to maximize scale and top line growth, with an intent to try to land inside the range in EBITDA as opposed to try to beat EBITDA. And then on your second question with respect to the supply side, let me talk about merchants first. And with COVID and the recent pandemic, it became clear to merchants that they need a delivery channel. So merchants that weren't participating in delivery prior to the pandemic needed to get that -- deliver that quickly. And so we saw a massive influx in terms of merchants, which led to selection growth. And you can see that in the chart that we included in the shareholder letter where the selections available on the platform has continued to grow. In terms of our cost to acquire merchants has been relatively stable, the same goes on the Dasher side where you've had sort of a tale of two cities. On the one hand, you would have expected a large influxes of Dashers as a result of heightened unemployment, but that was offset to some degree by stimulus checks. Regardless of all of that, our cost to acquire Dashers have been sort of stable in terms of within the realm of where we were expecting. Maybe I'll start with your first question on customer acquisition cost. To be clear, we manage our business to pay back thresholds. And so the customer acquisition cost, the CPA that we pay in order to acquire customers simply an output resulting from a payback period that we're trying to hit. And so to the extent that we continue increasing the LTV of our customer base through improved profitability, through improved engagement, through levers such as DashPass, it gives us more flexibility to increase our CPA. So, I view our increasing CAC as a feature where we're able to fund higher and higher amounts of customer acquisition in order to acquire a larger and larger share of new customers joining the industry, which then when you couple that with our industry-leading attention, needs to continue market share gains in the future. So the increase in customer acquisition costs are a choice that we're making to reinvest the profitability in our business. On the question around counter revenue, just looking at 2020 versus 2021, the -- again, we don't guide to revenue, but I would point to the fact that we have an incremental cost resulting from Prop 22 that didn't exist in 2020 for the most part. And so you will see a decrement to our take rate in 2021 as a result of that incremental Prop 22 cost, the vast majority of which we're choosing to absorb. And lastly, on the advertising front, again, we don't reference one channel over another necessarily. We're managing the business to payback periods. And so we will -- we'll flexibly deploy capital across regions, across channels as long as it hits our payback thresholds. Sure. So on the first question with respect to AOV, the first thing I should clarify is if you take our GOV and divide it by total orders, remember that AOV compression in part is driven by the fact that our total orders includes Drive orders, but the value associated with the Drive order is not contained in our GOV. And so when you see deceleration in AOV, some portion of that deceleration is being caused by an increasing mix of Drive orders. So I want to make sure I clarify that. Second, having said that, if I just look at our marketplace orders alone, AOVs remain above pre-COVID levels, but not massively above pre-COVID levels, that continued sort of normalizing over the course of the -- of 2020. They were at a high in Q2 and so has continued normalizing since then, but it's still modestly above pre-COVID levels. And we expect continued moderation over the course of 2021. On your question on seasonality, what I'd say is what was embedded into our guidance is an assumption that the vaccine will be broadly available soon and that in-store dining will resume relatively soon. And as a result, starting from Q2 onwards, we're going to see a reversion toward pre-COVID behavior within the customer base. That includes a reversion in terms of AOVs as well as order frequency, and that's compounded by the traditional seasonality you see around the summertime where order frequencies are impacted as consumers can get out more and go to restaurants a lot more. To the extent the consumer behavior remains propped up as a result of a delay in the vaccine or other factors, obviously, we'll perform to the upside. Great. Youssef, so let me take the question on take rate first, and then Tony can talk about international. Actually, when you think -- when we call our strategy long term, the idea is to lower commissions and fees and merchants to lower fees in consumers and to increase Dash earnings. That's the simple sort of equation that we're trying to solve for.

Not only growth but sustained growth. Yes. Samuel, on your question on batching, batch rates have been relatively consistent for the last -- since Q2.

It's better predictions of kitchen prep time to ensure the Dasher doesn't show up at the restaurant earlier than the food might be ready and so on. So batch rates are obviously an important source for the -- beyond resource. Thank you."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy, and thanks, everyone, for joining our very first earnings call. 2020 really put into focus the mission of our company and why we started this journey 7.5 years ago. We exist to grow and to empower local economies. As this is our first earnings call, I thought I'd give you a snapshot into how our team has executed this mission during the most critical times, and I'll follow by sharing a few thoughts on where we are going as we hopefully soon emerge out of this pandemic. 2020 was a difficult year for all of our audiences, and our operations made great challenges and faced enormous uncertainty. While exhausting at times, I'm proud that our team chose optimism, built plans, prepared for all scenarios and executed 24/7 to ensure that we did our part in seeing the best of our local communities. While much of the work began in March 2020, a lot of the impact was carried into Q4. We prioritized safety by shipping no contact delivery, distributed more than 10 million units of PPE in the form of hand sanitizers, gloves and masks to Dashers, and we collaborated with merchants on tamper-proof packaging. We prioritized Dashers' health by offering affordable telehealth visits with doctors, ensured financial assistance for those impacted by COVID-19, and just last week, hosted our first webinar to provide Dashers with information about the vaccine. Equally important, we became a lifeline to millions of people who saw flexible earnings opportunities, especially after furloughs and other forms of job loss. In Q4 alone, over one million Dashers earned over $2 billion in supplemental income on our platform. We reduced our commissions by half to local merchants, an investment totaling over $100 million, while funding national marketing campaigns to drive growth and add instant liquidity. We provided grants to more than nearly 2,000 local restaurants to help them adapt to the COVID winter. And by the end of Q4 2020, our analysis showed that the odds of surviving during the pandemic were eight times better for merchants on DoorDash versus all U.S. restaurants. For consumers, we accelerated our entry into the convenience and grocery categories. From September to December last year, we observed 95% growth in consumers who order from these new categories on the DoorDash marketplace. Finally, we supported our community by donating free DashPass subscriptions to healthcare workers across the country and partnered with organizations like the New York City Department of Public Schools, United Way and Feeding America to deliver food, groceries and supplies to those most in need, powering the delivery of 6.5 million meals to those in need during 2020. I want to thank all of our teams worldwide and the millions of consumers, Dashers and merchants who each stepped up in their own ways to navigate this pandemic. As we progress out of the pandemic, I thought I'd remind everyone of our long-term vision, which will take decades to build. In order to grow and empower local economies, we plan to build a marketplace and platform to enable every brick-and-mortar business to compete in today's convenience economy. The job of our marketplace is to grow in merchant sales, and we aspire to bring all of your city to you in minutes, not hours or days. Today, most of our business is in the restaurants category where we still see massive runway. We are investing to extend our category-leading position in the U.S. while doubling down on the momentum we are seeing overseas in Canada and in Australia. Outside of restaurants, we're excited about the early progress we're making after launching into the convenience and grocery categories. According to third-party data, DoorDash became the largest online convenience delivery platform in the U.S. in less than a year, demonstrating the extensibility of our platform. And this is just the beginning as we have a long way to go in building our marketplace to serve these and many other categories in the future. The job of our platform is to empower a brick-and-mortar merchant to build their own digital channel, a task necessary to have adapted to evolving consumer preferences before the pandemic and a task certainly necessary to have survived COVID-19. This business is even more critical as we come out of the pandemic as consumers have only become more habituated to a convenience economy, aided by a possible longer-term trend toward working from home. Today, merchants can use DoorDash Drive to offer on demand and same-day delivery from their own digital channels. In cases where merchants don't have an online ordering solution, they can use DoorDash Storefront, which enables them to participate in e-commerce and gives them a product that's seamlessly tied to their back-of-house systems. Over time, we will have to build even more products and services to enable merchants to run their digital business as effectively as we operate our marketplace. Underpinning our marketplace and platform is our maniacal focus on operating efficiency where we believe best-in-class execution will result in an improving cost structure that unlocks further investment capital as we grow our skin. With that, let me hand it over to Prabir. Heath, it's Tony. I'll take that question. If you can think of any silver linings of this pandemic, I think it is that every brick-and-mortar store, whether they are a restaurant or a retailer, is participating in e-commerce, sometimes exclusively in e-commerce given some of the restrictions that we saw during the past year. And for us, we really were seeing that on both sides of our business as a marketplace as well as a platform. On the marketplace front, we launched our second category of convenience item deliveries about a year ago when we announced partnerships with 7-Eleven, CVS, Walgreens and many others. And already, that has picked up quite a lot of momentum in the early progress. Again, very early, but according to third-party estimates, DoorDash already is the largest delivery platform for convenience goods in the U.S. And I think you're seeing some of the extensibility of starting with the highest frequency category of restaurants, building the biggest audience there and covering the most number of stores there, just given the nature of how many restaurants there are relative to how many other types of stores there are. That have made us be able to accelerate very, very quickly into some of these other categories. On the platform front, we've actually been delivering from a lot of these partners for a while. DoorDash Drive launched in 2017 Q1. So it's about four years old now. And Prabir mentioned some of the categories that really came into fruition in the past year, whether that be in retail as we partnered with the likes of Macy's and Michael's, pet supplies, PetSmart and Petco, or pharmacy with Sam's Club. And so I think what you're seeing is every business recognizes that omnichannel is a great thing. Every business is trying to figure out how to redo their supply chains to really meet a post-pandemic omnichannel presence, which they expect to grow. And we'll be there with them, both with our marketplace as well as our platform. Yes, Eric, I'll take that one. Look, the goal on -- if you think about our portfolio of investments today, we are growing in our core category of restaurants, which we have -- we believe, has massive runway ahead. We're adding categories to becoming a multi-marketplace -- multicategory marketplace. We're adding products on our platform in addition to Drive and Storefront. And the fourth area is international. So our perspective on international opportunities is really taking a very long-term view and becoming a global company over the long run. And given what we've seen, even with our current footprint in Australia and Canada where we believe we gained share in 2020 and saw improvements in our unit economics, we're really liking what we've seen with our playbook. And we also like what we see in terms of some of the geographic opportunities outside of the ones we operate in, in terms of just how underpenetrated and how large some of these opportunities are, especially as we bring a multiproduct portfolio into those geographies. With respect to how we enter, obviously, we'll look at any opportunities and weigh them against our own organic efforts. So far, we like our playbook, and we'll always seek to enter markets in a differentiated way for all of the audiences. Yes. I'll take that. Look, certainly, we have a full plate, and it's a broad surface area. And the goal was always, over many decades, to build both a marketplace and a platform in which we can transform every brick-and-mortar business. So that aperture is -- was wide even 7.5 years ago when we started the company. The way I tend to think about this is less about which thing comes up, I guess, most often in my dreams. It's more -- do we have the right leader and are we setting up that leader with the right cross-functional team for success. And as Prabir mentioned in some of the opening remarks, a lot of these projects that we're talking about, they're in very different stages of progression. And we tend to invest, kind of, measure it to what we see, both in terms of achieving product market fit as well as just where we are in the maturation and development of that market opportunity. So it's not like -- I guess it's making sure that we always have that portfolio of investments and making sure that so long as we have the right team and the right single-threaded focus on that area that the focus is really just on that execution and nothing else. Well, I think it's important to start with what it is that we want to achieve with respect to anything policy when it comes to Dashers. And for us, that always starts with what it is that Dashers want. And I think what you saw in Proposition 22 was that both politics and policies sided with the Dasher. Both sides of the aisle and California came together to support Dashers' desire to keep the flexibility that, frankly, doesn't exist in any other type of work opportunity and then paired that flexibility with greater security. And wherever there are opportunities to have discussions about how can we maintain this flexibility and really create a set of standards around it that gives portable and proportional benefits tied to this flexibility, we're happy to have those conversations. I mean if you just look at some of the outcomes that have been achieved with Prop 22, I mean, you see a 50% increase in Net Promoter Scores for Dashers post Prop 22 in the State of California. So I think this is an instance where business and policy actually achieve the outcomes -- or the outcomes actually achieved the objectives that it set out to accomplish. Yes. So Jason, maybe I'll take the first part of the question. So I think the first question was on Storefront. Look, Storefront is very early. It's a little over six months old as a product, and it has grown extremely, extremely quickly since launch. And you're right, in some sense for merchants, it's a bit of a no-brainer because it already integrates with all of their back-of-house systems that we've had to do on our marketplace. On the flip side, there's a lot of work to be done, making sure that it works with a wide variety of merchants. We serve -- we're very privileged and proud to serve hundreds of thousands of businesses, but that also comes with lots of complexity in terms of their operations, their protocols, their reporting requirements and things -- and so on and so forth. And so that's really where we are. We're back to how we think about investment horizons and how we manage capital allocation. Right now, Storefront is really in the product market fit phase. And so we're just trying to create more and more features such that it can deliver more and more of the benefits that we see in our own marketplace to a merchant's own digital channel. Youssef, on your second question around international, I touched upon this a little bit earlier. But for us, it's really taking a really long-term view. And otherwise, candidly, we would not have launched in the United States either as we were not the first player in 2013 when we founded the company. And so I think for us, it's really looking for areas of opportunity where we can bring something of unique difference and taking a pretty long-term view on what it is that we can do for all of the audiences, consumers, merchants and Dashers. And I mean, if you look at some of the markets, well, frankly, even in the U.S., it's still pretty early days. The penetration levels are quite low in these very large geographies, including those that have players already existing there. So for us, it's always just obsessing over the consumer, merchant and Dasher. And I think if we do that, our products will speak for themselves. Yes. I'll take the first question on DashPass. And I think since Prabir talked earlier about active efficiency, I'll let him take the second question on batching. With respect to DashMart, we're super excited about the DashMart business. It's, again, very early days. What turned into an experiment at the end of 2019 has been something that we've invested into 2020. And so we're certainly seeing the right input metrics to cross our investment thresholds and stage this for further capital allocation. And really, if you think about the thesis behind DashMart, it's really bringing selection to where it has not existed before. Whether that means giving merchants -- it's really a win-win for merchants and consumers. For merchants, it gives them the opportunity to bridge into certain geographies that they may want to be in but aren't currently in, in the depth or magnitude that they wish. For consumers, it's getting selection that they've never had before. I mean for example, I mean, if you think about restaurateurs, they also sell a lot of retail items, as an example, where in places like Chicago, we carry the sauces of chefs like Stephanie Izard and many others in which we're serving the restaurants on DoorDash and Caviar. We're also now serving some of their other products through DashMart. Equivalently, that's also happening in other categories as well where, again, for merchants, this is an extension to bring them beyond their four walls wherever they are. And for consumers, it's giving them selection that they've never had access to before. Great. Thanks, everyone."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Andy Hargreaves, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thanks. So, hello, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I am pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call, including our expectations of our business, future financial results and guidance, strategy and statements regarding the recently announced acquisition of the Wolt\u2019s transaction result. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, and some such risks are described in our risk factors, including in our SEC filings, including Form 10-K. You shouldn\u2019t rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial results, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our Investor Letter, which is available on our IR site. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. And with that, we can go straight to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I know you are focused on maximizing the long-term profit dollars. Just hoping you could provide some more color on how to think about the near-term investment and loss levels in some of the new categories, just relative to the profit and cash generation that you mentioned in the core restaurant business? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hi, Doug. Thanks for the question. Yes. That\u2019s right. We are focused on maximizing scale and the reason for that is because we operate in very large categories that are underpenetrated today. What I will say is, we are not breaking out the margins of the investments in our new categories other than to say that the U.S. business is growing nicely and has an increase in contribution margins, both on a quarter-on-quarter and a year-on-year basis. So that increase in profit is what we are funding into these investments and we are watching for core signals around retention and order frequency to make sure that they hit our term thresholds.\nDouglas Anmuth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions from me, please. One, did you guys see any benefits from Omicron during the quarter and how has January and early February trended versus your expectations? And second, can you maybe speak to recent trends in the competitive landscape and do you believe as your main competitor has been talking about that you guys may have lost some share in the U.S., and if so, maybe just kind of if you can flesh that out for us in terms of geos and product types where you feel you need to maybe regain some share? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: So maybe I will start the Omicron question, and then, Tony, can chime in with the competitive landscape. On Omicron specifically, the impact in Q4, even January, it\u2019s been relatively muted, it\u2019s not significant that I would call it out, and certainly, not significant when compared to the impact we saw from COVID in early in Q2. In fact, with every sort of successive variant, the impact on our business has basically diminished and so the Q4 outperformance, I wouldn\u2019t attribute that to Omicron. And Tony, if you want to comment on the competitive landscape.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Youssef. We actually haven\u2019t noticed any share loss in any time period recently in the fourth quarter or for the year of 2021. And I think when you think about maybe why this is, it really just breaks out into, I think, basic math, right? On new customers, we continue to be the leading acquirer of all customers that come into the industry for the first time. And then when you think about the possibility of new customer acquisition, especially just given how deep some of these channels are, they are really deeper than any other possible channel in which you can acquire new customers into the industry. I think the second part of how you can gain share certainly is, just what is the retention and order frequency of these customers, and we continue to have leading retention and order frequency in the category. And this has always been our focus, by the way, which is to make sure that we build the best product, which you can see as demonstrated through these leading both new customer acquisition, as well as retention metrics. And as a result, when I think about just this ties a little bit to, I think, the previous question that Doug was asking, just how large the core business opportunity is in U.S. restaurants, the fact that even as the share leader and continuing to be the fastest-growing part of the industry, we are only 5% of U.S. industry sales. And I think when you look at all of our active users, while we had a record quarter of 25 million monthly active consumers we are a single-digit percentage of the populations that we serve, and certainly, as you start adding into some of these new categories, as well as international geographies and there is a plus one side of what we do with products like driving store front. I mean, we are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the opportunity in front of us and that\u2019s why we are very excited in investing. But that said, in terms of how we view the future, besides staying disciplined in terms of how we make investments, it\u2019s -- first and foremost, starts with making sure that we have the best product, which is going to offer the best combination of selection, quality, affordability and service, and so long as we continue doing that, I think, the scoreboard will continue taking care of itself.\nPrabir Adarkar: And just to add to Tony\u2019s point, Youssef, to answer your question directly, over the last 12 months, we have gained 2 points of share, over 2 points of share on our third-party data sources. And specifically, with respect to Q4, we believe we have gained share as we move faster than our peers based on their publicly reported numbers for their U.S. businesses.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Two questions. So is there anything unique about the experience thus far in Canada and Australia that gives you confidence that once Wolt comes into the fray that you will be able to run the same playbook successfully? I think there\u2019s some skepticism in the investment community that, what you see in the U.S. is replicable in the international countries. So maybe just talk a little bit about that. And then, Prabir, your sales and marketing expense was actually down a bit quarter-on-quarter in contrast to GOV being up nicely. So I think the letter mentioned customer acquisition being a little bit more efficient. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that? Is that some of that retention you are talking about kicking in or anything else on marketing efficiency? Thanks a lot.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Why don\u2019t I take the first question on some of our performance and progress internationally and then I will have Prabir take the second question on the sales and marketing expenses. With respect to our international progress, I mean, we are super excited in what we have seen and that\u2019s why we are only continuing to invest more there. And again, it starts with, how do we find product market fit and then how do we actually scale up our investments appropriately given what we are seeing. And what we see is, increased selection that we are offering customers, better quality of experience, more -- greater and greater affordability levels, especially with our investments through programs like DashPass and better service levels. As a result, we are seeing higher order frequencies, higher retention, increase engagement with some of our new categories as well in these countries. And so, that\u2019s really what we are seeing from customers, and frankly, their voice, as well as their -- how they choose to spend their dollars is really what informs us and guides us. And so we are only seeing progress there. And I think those inputs are what has translated into certain outputs such as our revenue growth, order growth, category share growth, all of these things. So I think once we have nailed these inputs, that\u2019s why you are seeing the growth of the investments behind them and that\u2019s why we are also really excited about the Wolt partnership, because we will get to do this on a bigger scale across over 20 countries. And Prabir, do you want to add\u2026\nPrabir Adarkar: Ross, just to add\u2026\nTony Xu: \u2026on that topic?\nPrabir Adarkar: Yeah. Yeah. And just to finish up that point, I mean, there\u2019s obviously been category driver that Tony alluded to. But in addition, I mean, we stay super disciplined when it comes to these investments. That\u2019s what\u2019s allowed us to grow the U.S. business and we are applying the same rigor to whether it\u2019s new categories or international, and we are seeing margin improvement. And so that then allows us to invest more with greater confidence. So let me just conclude that point. And on your question on sales and marketing, the reason why sales and marketing declined was because our Driver acquisition or Dasher acquisition cost were lower quarter-on-quarter. As we have said in earlier quarters, we fixed the undersupply situation that we faced earlier in Q2 and we find ourselves well supplied, and we expect to be well supplied in 2022. And the big reason for that is because the people that generally become Dashers are a very different audience than the types of people that the other gig economy competes companies are competing for it. So specifically, I think, we had said over 90% of Dashers had really they have no plans to drive for rideshare and only 4% say they prefer to drive share compared to food delivery. And so the reasons for that is, because you don\u2019t need a car to Dash. You can Dash on a scooter, you can Dash on a bike. It tends to be safer because we are not sharing your personal space with another human being. So as a result of that, it\u2019s a very different audience that we can go after, and we -- because we find ourselves was supplied to those Dashers acquisition cost and resulting as the marketing counts decline quarter-on-quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions from us. So, first, Tony, in 2021, you guys launched a lot of new offerings and expanded across many verticals. The pace of innovation was pretty strong. But as we think about 2022 and maybe even 2023, what are one or two main initiatives you feel is ready to graduate and kind of become more meaningful on financial KPIs in the next like 12 months to 24 months? And then second question, maybe for Prabir, it seems like MAU was up 20% last year and frequency was also up pretty nicely. But as we think about your guidance, 19% GOV growth at the high end for full year, how should we think about the assumptions for MAU growth frequency and AOE for this year? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Deepak. On the first question, I appreciate the comments on product innovation. We are always trying to accelerate that, especially when we hear signals from how we can serve customers better, whether they be consumers, merchants or Dashers. So we are constantly trying to increase the pace when we see that opportunity and only until we find product market fit do we actually scale them into fairly large businesses, and I think we have had a track record of doing this now, whether it\u2019s certainly our core U.S. restaurants business, then building products on our platform like DoorDash Drive, as well as Storefront. We are the leading category player in the convenience category, in the pickup category. We have taken businesses pretty much from scratch in these new categories of convenience, grocery and other categories from zero into now $1 billion plus scale businesses that 14% of our monthly active users spend time in and so I think there\u2019s been a lot of progress to your point. In terms of just focusing on one or two things, what we tend to do is, our investment philosophy is really -- it starts with building the best product. And so long as we like what we are seeing from a product market fit perspective and we are constantly trying to make every detail right within each one of these categories, then do we stage gate further investment into growing these, whether it be into new geographies, into more merchants. We doubled the number of non-restaurant partners, for example, in our marketplace in 2021. But we have a lot of work to do. And so, the way I think about it is, so long as we stick to our investment philosophy of making sure that we build the best possible product as measured by our retention and order frequency, and we stay disciplined in how we can scale them, not just with capital, but frankly, with the right leaders place in these initiatives, as well as the right team allocated to those leaders, we will be in a great spot.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Deepak, on your question around the 2022, and obviously, the longer term outlook. Look, it\u2019s as simple as the goal is to increase the end use and to continue having the part of sequence. We don\u2019t run the business on a one-year clock and we think about planting seeds for many, many years in the future. So the way to think about it is these categories, even the food categories to be underpenetrated. In that core business at a tight run rate, we are less than as Tony alluded to 5% of total net restaurant sales. And so even in core food, there\u2019s significant room for continued adoption and engagement increases. Now you add to that all these other categories that we have made initial forays into, right, whether it\u2019s convenience, grocery, alcohol, pet food, retail and so on. These are massive markets that are also in lower and lesser penetrated compared to the food category. So we put these two things together, it\u2019s an exciting opportunity set ahead and basically signals that we are seeing in terms of early adoption and engagement as we transition from being food delivery app to basically all of your -- serving all of your local commerce needs. It gives us confidence that we will sustain a healthy growth rate for a long period of time.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Prabir. Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Boone: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two, please. One, can you just update on your progress on advertising and can that contribute to 2022? Or is it a longer-term initiative? And then secondly, on non-restaurant verticals, where are you seeing traction with consumers? Is it grocery? Is it alcohol? Can you be a little bit more specific there? Thank you so much.\nTony Xu: Yes. Sure. I will take both of those and feel free to add Prabir. On the first question around advertising, we are seeing tremendous excitement, pretty much actually from all of the stakeholders, from advertisers, from retailers, from restaurants, from consumers. And to me, what\u2019s really important is making sure that we can achieve two objectives, which sometimes can come at odds with one another. One is how do we offer the best return in -- advertiser return in terms of their return on spend. And the second is how do we make sure that we certainly not degrade, but ideally improve the consumer shopping experience. And these are the two things that we are constantly focused on. And so we are in no rush to monetize, although we are really excited by what we are seeing. But these are kind of our objective functions, if you will, when it comes to advertising. It\u2019s doing really well. It\u2019s off to a tremendous start. There is extraordinary demand. But I think staying disciplined, and again, building the best possible product to allow us to have these long-term sustained periods of growth is what -- is how we think about this. With respect to, I think, the new categories, we are actually seeing traction within each category. And I think in some regard, this is probably not a surprise. I mean just think about some of these categories, whether it\u2019s things that you are stocking up in your pantry or grocery shopping or everything in between. I mean these are the highest frequency possible categories when it comes to consumer spend. And all we are really doing is, I think, adding to the incremental demand on one side by making sure that customers can get things delivered in minutes, not hours or days. And then on the other side, we are enabling these retailers and merchants to be able to do it through their own channels, their own apps, their own websites. And so I think for those reasons, that\u2019s why we are seeing this growth. I mean, I think, as you saw in our shareholder letter, on an aggregate basis, about 14% of our monthly active shoppers have shopped in a category outside of restaurants. But that number is substantially higher than that in hundreds of markets already and so -- and this is pretty universal across categories.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Andrew, just on your -- just to go back to the advertising question, we are expecting advertising revenues to grow in 2022, but we will invest those incremental profits and the growth initiatives with the aim of maximizing long-term profit dollars.\nAndrew Boone: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe just dovetailing with some of what we have talked about so far. As you move into more categories and you think about more product evolution over the long-term, I think in the Shareholder Letter, there was a comment about retention and frequency in LTV. How should we be thinking about long-term margin structure or the long-term LTV-to-CAC in this business now versus maybe the pre-pandemic period when you IPOed a couple of years ago and how would you frame what you have learned over the last couple of years with respect to that? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Eric. Just to -- let me take that question. The first thing, I\u2019d say is, what we shared in the letter was meant to be a framework for how we think about how we manage the business. So today, we are not managing the business to a certain margin. We are not trying to increase margins quarter-on-quarter. We are not trying to manage an absolute amount of EBITDA. Instead, what we do is we invest. And we invest in areas. We start small and we look for signals along two dimensions. The first is product market fit. So we alluded to the fact that 14% of our MAUs use verticals outside of food. That\u2019s a signal of product market fit. We are looking forward to frequency signals. We are looking for the impact of initiatives and actions we take on retention on the core platform whether it\u2019s a relative to the core platform. If we see product market signals, that\u2019s one criteria that\u2019s been met. The second is are we making progress on unit economics. And we have a view for each business, what target unit economics need to be in order to meet our return thresholds. And so we are looking for steady progress. When you have seen both of these things, like we have with our new verticals, like we have with our international business and with our platform business, that\u2019s when we start scaling up our investments. And so that\u2019s the framework we generally use versus trying to target a certain margin. The reason we included that example in the shareholder letter was to provide a case study of how we think about it, because if you were trying to grow margins period-on-period, a product like DashPass would never come to be, it just wouldn\u2019t because on each order, DashPass has a lower unit margins. But as we said from the beginning, if you are optimizing for long-term profit dollars, and we have confidence in the increasing order frequency of the DashPass program. As a result, the total dollars we can generate per user on the platform are higher compared to the alternatives. And so I am not avoiding the question legitly, because we aren\u2019t running the business to certain target, but we are happy with the progress we are making on maximizing long-term profit dollars. The one thing that gives me further confidence or sort of room for upside is the advertising opportunity, where the advertising opportunity only grows as our users and our engagement grows, and today, compared to year ago with 20% MAUs compare to several years ago, where three, four times size of our business, and these individuals are engaging with us, not just in the restaurant vertical, because all of these different other verticals and over multiple services within the app, which then gives us a tremendous opportunity to not just create new business lines, but also generate advertising revenue with a healthy ROAs. And so I think of that as upside to the model. It\u2019s not something that you should make in certainly in the near-term, because we need to be very careful about how we, if we not just enable advertising ROAs, but do so in a way that doesn\u2019t degrade the consumer experience.\nTony Xu: The only thing I\u2019d add to what Prabir said is really, I think, the latter part of the question around what have we learned kind of during the pre-COVID kind of post-COVID era of behavior. Is just the resilience of the category and how I think we have put to rest, I think this question of what happens to demand as diners go back and eat inside restaurants. Well, I think clearly, takeout and delivery, as shown by our performance, not just in the fourth quarter but also in 2021, just in an aggregate is that they are complementary. It\u2019s very possible to eat inside of a restaurant and get delivery, because we eat three times or more maybe per day, and that\u2019s over 100 shopping moments per month. And then you start adding in these other categories, and you just ask yourself the question, well, is it complementary to go inside shopping malls or other types of stores and maybe get it delivered online or over the Internet. And I think that\u2019s kind of what we have seen certainly in the restaurant delivery business and we are starting to see that in all of our other categories.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have seen some examples on the app when I ordered dinner, for example, might push me to order ice cream from another local store. I imagine new categories like grocery and alcohol and convenience, so probably incrementally less time sensitive. So there\u2019s probably even a greater opportunity for Dashers to go to multiple stores for the same customer, but is that a substantial opportunity, either from a cost efficiency perspective or higher GOV or maybe some potential advertising opportunity?\nTony Xu: Hey. It\u2019s Tony. Yeah. I will take your question. I think it\u2019s a really good point and I think this kind of really is very exciting for us, because it\u2019s the thesis we have had since really day one of the company, which is this business anything last mile and local commerce is really about building greatest order density. That\u2019s why we started with restaurants, right? It has the highest count of stores across every category of local retail restaurants who that is and it has the highest frequency of use, which is what gives you the possibility for the highest order density. And if you can start with the highest order density, then you have a lot of optionality. Optionality to do some of the things that you describe a bring other types of things and I think hopefully being useful to consumers and different kinds of merchants, which therefore provides more flexible work opportunities for Dashers. It also provides opportunities to do I think some of the things you described around, which is efficiency. But to us, it\u2019s just again, it goes back to, how do we become more and more useful in people\u2019s lives, right? How do we solve more jobs for a consumer as we think about every shopping occasion they have. And again, while we have impressive order frequency, it\u2019s a small fraction of actually how much shopping that actually takes place, right? So we have a lot of work to do, I think, to solve even more jobs. And I think the same is true for merchants and not only in helping them build their channels, but doing other types of jobs for them. That\u2019s why we have our platform services business. And I think together, if we can do these two things, we will provide the greatest number of work opportunities for Dashers as well. And so you are absolutely right, and I think a lot of the assumptions behind the question. But to us, it just starts with how do we build the best possible experience in solving the most number of jobs.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael McGovern with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael McGovern: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could dig a little bit more into the chart about DashPass order mix versus contribution profit per active consumer. I thought it was pretty surprising and interesting to see that there\u2019s such a wide variance of DashPass order mix and also the contribution dollars. So I was wondering what causes some cohorts to lag and then is it kind of just a function of time to get those lagging cohorts up to that close to $25 mark of contribution profit per active consumer? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hey. Thanks for the question, Mike. And it\u2019s a good opportunity to explain exactly what the chart is because we got a few questions ahead of the call. So each dot on the chart is a quarterly cohort. So each -- this quarterly cohort starting from 2019 all the way through to the third quarter of 2021. And along the X-axis is the percentage of the orders from that cohort that are DashPass orders. On the Y-axis is the Q -- is the -- in quarter the Q4 2021 contribution profit per active user in that quarter for each of these cohorts. And as you can see, this positive correlation where the higher the DashPass order mix, the higher the contribution profit for MAU. And it goes back to the answer I gave to Eric to his question, which is with DashPass, we are making a trade-off to accept lower unit margins in exchange for significantly higher order frequency. And so as the order frequency increases, you generate more orders and those orders translate into greater cumulative contribution profit for each user. Now to your question around what drive the variance, its largely time. On the left side of this chart are basically newer cohorts, the right side of the shop are the older cohorts. And so generally, as time goes by, people -- consumers get increasingly habituated. They started using the product and DashPass making financial sense because once you start placing more than 2 to 2.5 orders, the product pays for itself. And so what you see is over time, as you -- as consumers save more money, they start using underpin DashPass, but then further drives up their order frequency.\nMichael McGovern: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And I guess one quick follow-up on order frequency. I was just wondering and on the 14% of customers that are now trying non-restaurant ordering for the first time or, excuse me, just using it. Do you expect that restaurant and non-restaurant can exhibit similar order frequency trends long-term or do you think that eating and ordering from restaurants is fundamentally a higher order frequency you kind of market?\nPrabir Adarkar: In general, people\u2019s activity on our app resembles how they operate in their daily lives, right? So if you think about this question came up sort of a few quarters ago and we went public around the mix between national brand restaurants versus local restaurants and frankly, it replicates what you see in the industry. Similarly, with areas such as convenience and grocery and alcohol and pet food, essentially, over time, as people\u2019s awareness of DoorDash builds and as our selection builds and the levers that they live in, their behavior offline and online will converge. Today, it\u2019s lower because that level, we are still making progress in terms of the selection quality, affordability paradigm, in order to hit the sweet spots that more and more consumers start becoming aware of DoorDash as an on-demand way to actually get access to these verticals that are adjacent to food delivery and the ones that they use. So short answer to your question is, over time, I expect the order frequency to basically limit how people shop in their daily lives.\nMichael McGovern: Got it. That\u2019s great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. I have a couple, if I can. First, just thanks for sharing the updated cohort data. If we just focus on maybe the narrower subset of users added during the pandemic, do you see consistent frequency and retention on those newer cohorts compared to older cohorts and in particular, in markets that have reopened more than others? And anything you can kind of share on how you think that\u2019s going to play out over the rest of this year in terms of the cohort behavior and what\u2019s embedded in the guidance? And then, secondly, on grocery, at the time of the IPO, I think, there were still some question marks around the unit economics and scalability of grocery. As you guys have progressed and learned in that category, how do you feel today about your ability to generate attractive unit economics and kind of how is that informing how you go-to-market on the grocery side? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Great. So the first thing, let me just say is that the retention pre-COVID versus COVID, right? We were in the middle of COVID in 2020, retention spiked. It was at all-time highs, right? And then from there on, in 2021, you start to see a slow normalization to retention, especially as vaccination rates increased and in-store dining resumed. We are at a point now where -- and by the way, in 2021, early on in 2021, we were bolstered by the effect of stimulus payments that had an upward impact on both retention and order frequency. Where we are at today is still better than pre-pandemic levels. But the retention has now normalized where it\u2019s slightly above pedantic levels, but not substantially. Order frequency is substantially higher compared to pre-pandemic levels, as well as 2020 levels, but that\u2019s because of continued improvements to order frequency, both within the DashPass cohorts, as well as the non-DashPass cohorts.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Look, on the second question around grocery. I mean, here\u2019s like the way we think about it, right? I mean when you look at our portfolio of priorities, we have the U.S. core business of restaurant delivery. We have these new categories, one of which you are referencing grocery, platform services, international and advertising. The way we think about them is really, how are we doing against their life stage, right? Obviously, a lot of these businesses performed actually quite recently, a product like grocery, for example, is only about 12 months to 14 months old. We love the trajectory of the business, both top and bottomline, but it\u2019s still in its earliest innings. And so right now, the focus continues to be making sure that we keep improving the product experience, the selection of partners that we can bring on and the inventory from these partners, the quality of the experience itself, the affordability of these deliveries, as well as the service levels. And so that\u2019s really the focus right now on grocery, and again, like the way we think about making these investments is in a fairly disciplined way of making sure that we find product market fit before we actually scale these things out. And so when we do scale these things out, they tend to already have very, very robust unit economics and cohort performance.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on DashMart. Maybe can you guys talk about the expansion plan maybe for FY 2022 and what are the key learnings so far? And just curious, what do you need to see for this business to scale will you consider M&A or partnership to expand this segment? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Hey, James. It\u2019s Tony. So, on DashMart, we really like what we see. Again, like this is another one of these newer initiatives about year and a half old. And what we are learning, I think, are benefits really for -- starting with a couple of audiences and I will talk about how it translates into the third audience. So, first, for consumers, a lot of these DashMarts are just bring selection of inventory into geographies where, frankly, didn\u2019t previously exist, whether literally never existed or the hours of operation has now opened pretty wide to 24x7 now, which is a big improvement for what consumers are seeking. I think with respect to merchants, this is a critical infrastructure for a lot of them either to expand into new geographies or to increase into different hours of operations and so what we see is really DashMarts on a fairly long investment time horizon. Again, staying disciplined around finding product market fit before we choose to scale these things out, but what we are seeing is quite a lot of demand for them. And I think it really speaks to, again, what we are trying to create at DoorDash, which is really the largest local commerce app or marketplace where we are bringing incremental demand and the largest local commerce platform, where we are building tools and infrastructure, obviously, starting delivery with products like Drive. But if you think about all the other products and services that merchants need to build in order to compete digitally in today\u2019s economy, well, it certainly expands far beyond just logistics. And so DashMarts are really a form of infrastructure to store inventory to possibly enter new geographies and certainly expand their hours of service. And so we plan on investing in this line of work for a really long time for those reasons, and obviously, if we can build both a marketplace and a platform with DashMart, I think it provides tremendous work opportunities for Dashers. But again, the investment philosophy stays the same, given how young dash marks are. It\u2019s making sure that we have great product market fit and then we will continue to scale them.\nJames Lee: And one quick follow-up question, Tony here. When you look at the non-restaurant business, in general, like two parts to this question, when you look at user behavior, do they tend to be more recurring in nature, are they more impulsive? And also second, for your non-restaurant business in general, can you be profitable over time without advertising?\nTony Xu: So on the non-restaurant category what we are seeing is, pretty much quite a lot of different kinds of use cases. Are there people who just shop for impulse purchases for whatever the occasion might be, yes? But predominantly, we are seeing people come back for, I think, a lot of use cases. I mean, where the recurring behavior is looking for that middle of the week run now being solved by somebody else, right? That\u2019s really the job that we are solving for a lot of these customers, right? Like when you think about the items near pantry that get consumed the earliest or the items in your refrigerator that maybe perish the earliest, those are the things that actually -- those are the types of things where you have to go back everything in a week, no matter how much you buy on a weekly basis, right, and those are the jobs where people have to do every single week and so we are seeing certainly both, although more of the behavior is recurring. And then I will let Prabir take, I think, your second question, which is really around, I think, the business model.\nPrabir Adarkar: And James, we have not disclosed anything about the business model around non-restaurant verticals and so no comment on that question.\nJames Lee: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. Two questions. When you think about the number of DashPass members now, you have over 10 million out of, whatever, 25 million MAUs, what do you think are the obstacles to getting that penetration higher, I know it\u2019s high, 40%. But I would think given the value prop and the frequency of the activity that, that could get into 60%, 70%, maybe long-term. So what\u2019s -- what are the biggest things you have to solve for in order to get that penetration higher? And then any quick updated comments on Prop 22 and I know there was a the AG reversed or challenged the judge\u2019s decision earlier this month. Any updated thoughts on how that\u2019s going to play out or when we will know? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Prabir, do you want to take the first\u2026\nPrabir Adarkar: Yeah. I think\u2026\nTony Xu: \u2026 and I can take the second.\nPrabir Adarkar: I want to take the first one and you take the second one. Okay. So, Mark, on your question on the 10 million out of 40 million, yes, the 10 million was a milestone. We are happy with its 40% of our MAUs. But there\u2019s a lot of runway here, right? I mean, as you think about -- with 25 million MAUs, we are a small fraction of the U.S. population. Now add in the other countries we operate in, whether it\u2019s Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, and we have access to over 500 million people. And so in the context of that 500 million people, I mean even if you adjust for that for adults and so on, the 10 million membership size is a small fraction. So the path to get there is going to be back to the basics of selection, quality and affordability. So in selection, as we keep adding these new categories and new stores into these neighborhoods that cross-sell percentage, the 14% will start creeping up and order frequency in these new verticals will increase. Remember the point I made earlier about purchase behavior on our platform, ultimately mimicking or reflecting how human beings operate in their daily lives. So, over time, as that ate frequency increases, the savings opportunity increases and DashPass starts making sense. So even if it\u2019s someone that doesn\u2019t order enough restaurant delivery today, over time, DashPass may end up making sense for them, because they use DashPass to order their convenience goods, or their grocery goods or their liquid purchases or their pet food or retail and so on so forth. So there\u2019s opportunity in that front and there\u2019s opportunity for continuing improving quality. Today would mean consistent improvement, but reasonable number of deliveries are effective. So we have got a bunch of work to do to make the product reliable 100% of the time so that if you are a DashPass member, the experience truly feels special.\nTony Xu: Yeah. And Mark, with respect to your second question on Prop 22, nothing has changed. I mean, we are absolutely right on the law here. In fact, I think even the California Attorney General have supported us in this regard that, 58% to 59% of the state population and voting population are saying that they pass something into law that should be legalized. I think it\u2019s just common sense that that\u2019s the right legal answer. But I think even more importantly than this, just more broadly speaking, we feel the same way about this issue anywhere in the sense that drivers in this type of economy ought to be able to take wherever they want to work, whenever they want to work and that flexibility is critical. I mean that\u2019s what Prop 22 stands for a while giving them the protections that they deserve and we -- whether it\u2019s in the State of California or frankly, any geography globally, that\u2019s where we stand for, which is to support the Dasher. And the voters of California believe in this, the drivers believe in this and the California Attorney General believes in this.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Tony. Thank you, Prabir.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Erickson: Thanks. Just a couple. I guess, first, between the different categories, all the different categories you have going here in the U.S. and then, obviously, Wolt coming on here later this year, hopefully, and then Canada and Australia. Does all of that expansion, I guess, right in front of you, probably, keep you from, say, exploring other international expansion or should we assume other markets are sort of always under exploration? And then second, you think about the regulatory work likely to occur, if not in the future, if not already in your -- a lot of these international markets, talk about kind of how prepared you feel you are in terms of personnel and the associated expense necessary to kind of support those works, and hopefully, constructive dialogues? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey. It\u2019s Tony. I will take both of those questions. With respect to the first, I think, you are certainly right in saying that we have quite a lot on our plate and we are constantly, again, trying to invent the best possible products. And again, when you think about the portfolio of initiatives of U.S. restaurants, new categories or platform services, international markets and advertising, there\u2019s a lot of work to go around. So we always believe that we have to earn the right to serve customers in a second way by doing an excellent job in the first way and so that\u2019s really what we are focused on. But look, I mean, it doesn\u2019t mean that we are not scanning for opportunities. We are always looking for opportunities regardless, especially when we have such a robust core business that\u2019s producing positive cash flow and with a very healthy balance sheet, it gives us lots of opportunities to be opportunistic and go on the offensive. I think with respect to your second question around regulatory preparation. Yes, I mean, this has been -- something that\u2019s been a part of DoorDash really since 2013 when the company was founded. And this is -- these beliefs that we have had since day one of making sure that worker\u2019s should be able to have this new standard where they get the flexibility that they are telling us over and over again with their words, as well as with their feet. And also the protections that we believe they deserve. And frankly, just like expire outdated laws that deserve to be expired. And we think the productive way in doing this is that governments and businesses such as ourselves should work together across any geography to make sure that this actually happens from the perspective of the worker, not from any other perspective. And so that\u2019s what we are working really hard on and we have best-in-class teams to get that work done.\nBrad Erickson: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, guys. A couple of questions. On the marketplace side of things, non-restaurant partners doubled 2021. Clearly, you have a lot of runway there and you have a focus on product market fit for scaling. But how do you think about ways to grow partners on a platform? And then any dynamics to call out with respect to the different commission points you launched earlier in 2021, 15%, 25%, 30%, as cohorts of partners experience or use that model or are they moving up to the different commission points.\nTony Xu: Yeah. I will take the first question and maybe Prabir can take the second on the kind of different tiers of commission points. With respect to the first of adding more selection in these new categories, a lot of it is just doing the work quite candidly. I think what has been really attractive to all of these customers is, well, I mean, look at what we are bringing, we are bringing the largest on-demand audience for local commerce that has the highest frequency of shopping. That\u2019s an incremental use case both from their physical activities, their own digital activities and other -- any other previous digital partnerships that they have signed. And so, as a result of that, actually, we are seeing quite a lot of excitement where people are starting to think of DoorDash, not just as lunch and dinner, but really everything inside the neighborhood. So we are actually seeing quite a lot of progress. And but that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t work to be done. I mean we have to build a lot of products now that make sense for categories outside of restaurants, right? Everything from the catalog, to the in-store shopping process, to how we think about customer support, to think about how do we support people not just again on our channel, but also their own channel. So there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. But I would say that the excitement from partners has been tremendous. I think some of those names you have seen in the press and things like this and we expect adding a lot more partners to come.\nPrabir Adarkar: Brian, on the question about the pricing payers. Just as a reminder, this was aimed at SMB restaurants, not larger restaurants and on those that are coming through our self-service channel. So a small fraction of those have actually opted into the pricing tiers versus the prior pricing. And off the number that after the majority have picked the two higher tiers, which was in line with what we expected and kind of makes sense given the value that we drive at the higher pricing does.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jim Sanderson with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nJim Sanderson: Thanks for the question. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on DashPass, I am wondering if you could help us to understand how the new DashPass members were recruited if this is primarily through credit card marketing programs, and then going forward, as you try to expand these types of programs internationally if your client acquisition strategy for DashPass is going to have to adjust away from credit cards. Just a little bit more texture on how that growth has developed.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yeah. The vast majority of the DashPass members are through our own channels and the minority are through credit card channels.\nJim Sanderson: And then, are the percentage or share of DashPass members that pay full membership, is that changing over time?\nPrabir Adarkar: No. It\u2019s relatively consistent. But, again, it depends on -- you will remember that one of the ways we on DashPass is through a free trial period. So depending on the intensity of our marketing efforts that free -- the trial versus paid mix changes, which is very consistent.\nJim Sanderson: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Prabir Adarkar",
            "content": "Hi, Doug. Thanks for the question. Yes. That's right. We are focused on maximizing scale and the reason for that is because we operate in very large categories that are underpenetrated today. What I will say is, we are not breaking out the margins of the investments in our new categories other than to say that the U.S. business is growing nicely and has an increase in contribution margins, both on a quarter-on-quarter and a year-on-year basis. So that increase in profit is what we are funding into these investments and we are watching for core signals around retention and order frequency to make sure that they hit our term thresholds. So maybe I will start the Omicron question, and then, Tony, can chime in with the competitive landscape. On Omicron specifically, the impact in Q4, even January, it's been relatively muted, it's not significant that I would call it out, and certainly, not significant when compared to the impact we saw from COVID in early in Q2. In fact, with every sort of successive variant, the impact on our business has basically diminished and so the Q4 outperformance, I wouldn't attribute that to Omicron. And Tony, if you want to comment on the competitive landscape. And just to add to Tony's point, Youssef, to answer your question directly, over the last 12 months, we have gained 2 points of share, over 2 points of share on our third-party data sources. And specifically, with respect to Q4, we believe we have gained share as we move faster than our peers based on their publicly reported numbers for their U.S. businesses. Ross, just to add... Yeah. Yeah. And just to finish up that point, I mean, there's obviously been category driver that Tony alluded to. But in addition, I mean, we stay super disciplined when it comes to these investments. That's what's allowed us to grow the U.S. business and we are applying the same rigor to whether it's new categories or international, and we are seeing margin improvement. And so that then allows us to invest more with greater confidence. So let me just conclude that point. And on your question on sales and marketing, the reason why sales and marketing declined was because our Driver acquisition or Dasher acquisition cost were lower quarter-on-quarter. As we have said in earlier quarters, we fixed the undersupply situation that we faced earlier in Q2 and we find ourselves well supplied, and we expect to be well supplied in 2022. And the big reason for that is because the people that generally become Dashers are a very different audience than the types of people that the other gig economy competes companies are competing for it. So specifically, I think, we had said over 90% of Dashers had really they have no plans to drive for rideshare and only 4% say they prefer to drive share compared to food delivery. And so the reasons for that is, because you don't need a car to Dash. You can Dash on a scooter, you can Dash on a bike. It tends to be safer because we are not sharing your personal space with another human being. So as a result of that, it's a very different audience that we can go after, and we -- because we find ourselves was supplied to those Dashers acquisition cost and resulting as the marketing counts decline quarter-on-quarter. And Deepak, on your question around the 2022, and obviously, the longer term outlook. Look, it's as simple as the goal is to increase the end use and to continue having the part of sequence. We don't run the business on a one-year clock and we think about planting seeds for many, many years in the future. So the way to think about it is these categories, even the food categories to be underpenetrated. In that core business at a tight run rate, we are less than as Tony alluded to 5% of total net restaurant sales. And so even in core food, there's significant room for continued adoption and engagement increases. Now you add to that all these other categories that we have made initial forays into, right, whether it's convenience, grocery, alcohol, pet food, retail and so on. These are massive markets that are also in lower and lesser penetrated compared to the food category. So we put these two things together, it's an exciting opportunity set ahead and basically signals that we are seeing in terms of early adoption and engagement as we transition from being food delivery app to basically all of your -- serving all of your local commerce needs. It gives us confidence that we will sustain a healthy growth rate for a long period of time. And Andrew, just on your -- just to go back to the advertising question, we are expecting advertising revenues to grow in 2022, but we will invest those incremental profits and the growth initiatives with the aim of maximizing long-term profit dollars. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Eric. Just to -- let me take that question. The first thing, I'd say is, what we shared in the letter was meant to be a framework for how we think about how we manage the business. So today, we are not managing the business to a certain margin. We are not trying to increase margins quarter-on-quarter. We are not trying to manage an absolute amount of EBITDA. Instead, what we do is we invest. And we invest in areas. We start small and we look for signals along two dimensions. The first is product market fit. So we alluded to the fact that 14% of our MAUs use verticals outside of food. That's a signal of product market fit. We are looking forward to frequency signals. We are looking for the impact of initiatives and actions we take on retention on the core platform whether it's a relative to the core platform. If we see product market signals, that's one criteria that's been met. The second is are we making progress on unit economics. And we have a view for each business, what target unit economics need to be in order to meet our return thresholds. And so we are looking for steady progress. When you have seen both of these things, like we have with our new verticals, like we have with our international business and with our platform business, that's when we start scaling up our investments. And so that's the framework we generally use versus trying to target a certain margin. The reason we included that example in the shareholder letter was to provide a case study of how we think about it, because if you were trying to grow margins period-on-period, a product like DashPass would never come to be, it just wouldn't because on each order, DashPass has a lower unit margins. But as we said from the beginning, if you are optimizing for long-term profit dollars, and we have confidence in the increasing order frequency of the DashPass program. As a result, the total dollars we can generate per user on the platform are higher compared to the alternatives. And so I am not avoiding the question legitly, because we aren't running the business to certain target, but we are happy with the progress we are making on maximizing long-term profit dollars. The one thing that gives me further confidence or sort of room for upside is the advertising opportunity, where the advertising opportunity only grows as our users and our engagement grows, and today, compared to year ago with 20% MAUs compare to several years ago, where three, four times size of our business, and these individuals are engaging with us, not just in the restaurant vertical, because all of these different other verticals and over multiple services within the app, which then gives us a tremendous opportunity to not just create new business lines, but also generate advertising revenue with a healthy ROAs. And so I think of that as upside to the model. It's not something that you should make in certainly in the near-term, because we need to be very careful about how we, if we not just enable advertising ROAs, but do so in a way that doesn't degrade the consumer experience. Hey. Thanks for the question, Mike. And it's a good opportunity to explain exactly what the chart is because we got a few questions ahead of the call. So each dot on the chart is a quarterly cohort. So each -- this quarterly cohort starting from 2019 all the way through to the third quarter of 2021. And along the X-axis is the percentage of the orders from that cohort that are DashPass orders. On the Y-axis is the Q -- is the -- in quarter the Q4 2021 contribution profit per active user in that quarter for each of these cohorts. And as you can see, this positive correlation where the higher the DashPass order mix, the higher the contribution profit for MAU. And it goes back to the answer I gave to Eric to his question, which is with DashPass, we are making a trade-off to accept lower unit margins in exchange for significantly higher order frequency. And so as the order frequency increases, you generate more orders and those orders translate into greater cumulative contribution profit for each user. Now to your question around what drive the variance, its largely time. On the left side of this chart are basically newer cohorts, the right side of the shop are the older cohorts. And so generally, as time goes by, people -- consumers get increasingly habituated. They started using the product and DashPass making financial sense because once you start placing more than 2 to 2.5 orders, the product pays for itself. And so what you see is over time, as you -- as consumers save more money, they start using underpin DashPass, but then further drives up their order frequency. In general, people's activity on our app resembles how they operate in their daily lives, right? So if you think about this question came up sort of a few quarters ago and we went public around the mix between national brand restaurants versus local restaurants and frankly, it replicates what you see in the industry. Similarly, with areas such as convenience and grocery and alcohol and pet food, essentially, over time, as people's awareness of DoorDash builds and as our selection builds and the levers that they live in, their behavior offline and online will converge. Today, it's lower because that level, we are still making progress in terms of the selection quality, affordability paradigm, in order to hit the sweet spots that more and more consumers start becoming aware of DoorDash as an on-demand way to actually get access to these verticals that are adjacent to food delivery and the ones that they use. So short answer to your question is, over time, I expect the order frequency to basically limit how people shop in their daily lives. Great. So the first thing, let me just say is that the retention pre-COVID versus COVID, right? We were in the middle of COVID in 2020, retention spiked. It was at all-time highs, right? And then from there on, in 2021, you start to see a slow normalization to retention, especially as vaccination rates increased and in-store dining resumed. We are at a point now where -- and by the way, in 2021, early on in 2021, we were bolstered by the effect of stimulus payments that had an upward impact on both retention and order frequency. Where we are at today is still better than pre-pandemic levels. But the retention has now normalized where it's slightly above pedantic levels, but not substantially. Order frequency is substantially higher compared to pre-pandemic levels, as well as 2020 levels, but that's because of continued improvements to order frequency, both within the DashPass cohorts, as well as the non-DashPass cohorts. And James, we have not disclosed anything about the business model around non-restaurant verticals and so no comment on that question. Yeah. I think... I want to take the first one and you take the second one. Okay. So, Mark, on your question on the 10 million out of 40 million, yes, the 10 million was a milestone. We are happy with its 40% of our MAUs. But there's a lot of runway here, right? I mean, as you think about -- with 25 million MAUs, we are a small fraction of the U.S. population. Now add in the other countries we operate in, whether it's Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, and we have access to over 500 million people. And so in the context of that 500 million people, I mean even if you adjust for that for adults and so on, the 10 million membership size is a small fraction. So the path to get there is going to be back to the basics of selection, quality and affordability. So in selection, as we keep adding these new categories and new stores into these neighborhoods that cross-sell percentage, the 14% will start creeping up and order frequency in these new verticals will increase. Remember the point I made earlier about purchase behavior on our platform, ultimately mimicking or reflecting how human beings operate in their daily lives. So, over time, as that ate frequency increases, the savings opportunity increases and DashPass starts making sense. So even if it's someone that doesn't order enough restaurant delivery today, over time, DashPass may end up making sense for them, because they use DashPass to order their convenience goods, or their grocery goods or their liquid purchases or their pet food or retail and so on so forth. So there's opportunity in that front and there's opportunity for continuing improving quality. Today would mean consistent improvement, but reasonable number of deliveries are effective. So we have got a bunch of work to do to make the product reliable 100% of the time so that if you are a DashPass member, the experience truly feels special. Brian, on the question about the pricing payers. Just as a reminder, this was aimed at SMB restaurants, not larger restaurants and on those that are coming through our self-service channel. So a small fraction of those have actually opted into the pricing tiers versus the prior pricing. And off the number that after the majority have picked the two higher tiers, which was in line with what we expected and kind of makes sense given the value that we drive at the higher pricing does. Yeah. The vast majority of the DashPass members are through our own channels and the minority are through credit card channels. No. It's relatively consistent. But, again, it depends on -- you will remember that one of the ways we on DashPass is through a free trial period. So depending on the intensity of our marketing efforts that free -- the trial versus paid mix changes, which is very consistent."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Yeah. Hey, Youssef. We actually haven't noticed any share loss in any time period recently in the fourth quarter or for the year of 2021. And I think when you think about maybe why this is, it really just breaks out into, I think, basic math, right? On new customers, we continue to be the leading acquirer of all customers that come into the industry for the first time. And then when you think about the possibility of new customer acquisition, especially just given how deep some of these channels are, they are really deeper than any other possible channel in which you can acquire new customers into the industry. I think the second part of how you can gain share certainly is, just what is the retention and order frequency of these customers, and we continue to have leading retention and order frequency in the category. And this has always been our focus, by the way, which is to make sure that we build the best product, which you can see as demonstrated through these leading both new customer acquisition, as well as retention metrics. And as a result, when I think about just this ties a little bit to, I think, the previous question that Doug was asking, just how large the core business opportunity is in U.S. restaurants, the fact that even as the share leader and continuing to be the fastest-growing part of the industry, we are only 5% of U.S. industry sales. And I think when you look at all of our active users, while we had a record quarter of 25 million monthly active consumers we are a single-digit percentage of the populations that we serve, and certainly, as you start adding into some of these new categories, as well as international geographies and there is a plus one side of what we do with products like driving store front. I mean, we are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the opportunity in front of us and that's why we are very excited in investing. But that said, in terms of how we view the future, besides staying disciplined in terms of how we make investments, it's -- first and foremost, starts with making sure that we have the best product, which is going to offer the best combination of selection, quality, affordability and service, and so long as we continue doing that, I think, the scoreboard will continue taking care of itself. Yeah. Why don't I take the first question on some of our performance and progress internationally and then I will have Prabir take the second question on the sales and marketing expenses. With respect to our international progress, I mean, we are super excited in what we have seen and that's why we are only continuing to invest more there. And again, it starts with, how do we find product market fit and then how do we actually scale up our investments appropriately given what we are seeing. And what we see is, increased selection that we are offering customers, better quality of experience, more -- greater and greater affordability levels, especially with our investments through programs like DashPass and better service levels. As a result, we are seeing higher order frequencies, higher retention, increase engagement with some of our new categories as well in these countries. And so, that's really what we are seeing from customers, and frankly, their voice, as well as their -- how they choose to spend their dollars is really what informs us and guides us. And so we are only seeing progress there. And I think those inputs are what has translated into certain outputs such as our revenue growth, order growth, category share growth, all of these things. So I think once we have nailed these inputs, that's why you are seeing the growth of the investments behind them and that's why we are also really excited about the Wolt partnership, because we will get to do this on a bigger scale across over 20 countries. And Prabir, do you want to add... ...on that topic? Yeah. Hey, Deepak. On the first question, I appreciate the comments on product innovation. We are always trying to accelerate that, especially when we hear signals from how we can serve customers better, whether they be consumers, merchants or Dashers. So we are constantly trying to increase the pace when we see that opportunity and only until we find product market fit do we actually scale them into fairly large businesses, and I think we have had a track record of doing this now, whether it's certainly our core U.S. restaurants business, then building products on our platform like DoorDash Drive, as well as Storefront. We are the leading category player in the convenience category, in the pickup category. We have taken businesses pretty much from scratch in these new categories of convenience, grocery and other categories from zero into now $1 billion plus scale businesses that 14% of our monthly active users spend time in and so I think there's been a lot of progress to your point. In terms of just focusing on one or two things, what we tend to do is, our investment philosophy is really -- it starts with building the best product. And so long as we like what we are seeing from a product market fit perspective and we are constantly trying to make every detail right within each one of these categories, then do we stage gate further investment into growing these, whether it be into new geographies, into more merchants. We doubled the number of non-restaurant partners, for example, in our marketplace in 2021. But we have a lot of work to do. And so, the way I think about it is, so long as we stick to our investment philosophy of making sure that we build the best possible product as measured by our retention and order frequency, and we stay disciplined in how we can scale them, not just with capital, but frankly, with the right leaders place in these initiatives, as well as the right team allocated to those leaders, we will be in a great spot. Yes. Sure. I will take both of those and feel free to add Prabir. On the first question around advertising, we are seeing tremendous excitement, pretty much actually from all of the stakeholders, from advertisers, from retailers, from restaurants, from consumers. And to me, what's really important is making sure that we can achieve two objectives, which sometimes can come at odds with one another. One is how do we offer the best return in -- advertiser return in terms of their return on spend. And the second is how do we make sure that we certainly not degrade, but ideally improve the consumer shopping experience. And these are the two things that we are constantly focused on. And so we are in no rush to monetize, although we are really excited by what we are seeing. But these are kind of our objective functions, if you will, when it comes to advertising. It's doing really well. It's off to a tremendous start. There is extraordinary demand. But I think staying disciplined, and again, building the best possible product to allow us to have these long-term sustained periods of growth is what -- is how we think about this. With respect to, I think, the new categories, we are actually seeing traction within each category. And I think in some regard, this is probably not a surprise. I mean just think about some of these categories, whether it's things that you are stocking up in your pantry or grocery shopping or everything in between. I mean these are the highest frequency possible categories when it comes to consumer spend. And all we are really doing is, I think, adding to the incremental demand on one side by making sure that customers can get things delivered in minutes, not hours or days. And then on the other side, we are enabling these retailers and merchants to be able to do it through their own channels, their own apps, their own websites. And so I think for those reasons, that's why we are seeing this growth. I mean, I think, as you saw in our shareholder letter, on an aggregate basis, about 14% of our monthly active shoppers have shopped in a category outside of restaurants. But that number is substantially higher than that in hundreds of markets already and so -- and this is pretty universal across categories. The only thing I'd add to what Prabir said is really, I think, the latter part of the question around what have we learned kind of during the pre-COVID kind of post-COVID era of behavior. Is just the resilience of the category and how I think we have put to rest, I think this question of what happens to demand as diners go back and eat inside restaurants. Well, I think clearly, takeout and delivery, as shown by our performance, not just in the fourth quarter but also in 2021, just in an aggregate is that they are complementary. It's very possible to eat inside of a restaurant and get delivery, because we eat three times or more maybe per day, and that's over 100 shopping moments per month. And then you start adding in these other categories, and you just ask yourself the question, well, is it complementary to go inside shopping malls or other types of stores and maybe get it delivered online or over the Internet. And I think that's kind of what we have seen certainly in the restaurant delivery business and we are starting to see that in all of our other categories. Hey. It's Tony. Yeah. I will take your question. I think it's a really good point and I think this kind of really is very exciting for us, because it's the thesis we have had since really day one of the company, which is this business anything last mile and local commerce is really about building greatest order density. That's why we started with restaurants, right? It has the highest count of stores across every category of local retail restaurants who that is and it has the highest frequency of use, which is what gives you the possibility for the highest order density. And if you can start with the highest order density, then you have a lot of optionality. Optionality to do some of the things that you describe a bring other types of things and I think hopefully being useful to consumers and different kinds of merchants, which therefore provides more flexible work opportunities for Dashers. It also provides opportunities to do I think some of the things you described around, which is efficiency. But to us, it's just again, it goes back to, how do we become more and more useful in people's lives, right? How do we solve more jobs for a consumer as we think about every shopping occasion they have. And again, while we have impressive order frequency, it's a small fraction of actually how much shopping that actually takes place, right? So we have a lot of work to do, I think, to solve even more jobs. And I think the same is true for merchants and not only in helping them build their channels, but doing other types of jobs for them. That's why we have our platform services business. And I think together, if we can do these two things, we will provide the greatest number of work opportunities for Dashers as well. And so you are absolutely right, and I think a lot of the assumptions behind the question. But to us, it just starts with how do we build the best possible experience in solving the most number of jobs. Yeah. Look, on the second question around grocery. I mean, here's like the way we think about it, right? I mean when you look at our portfolio of priorities, we have the U.S. core business of restaurant delivery. We have these new categories, one of which you are referencing grocery, platform services, international and advertising. The way we think about them is really, how are we doing against their life stage, right? Obviously, a lot of these businesses performed actually quite recently, a product like grocery, for example, is only about 12 months to 14 months old. We love the trajectory of the business, both top and bottomline, but it's still in its earliest innings. And so right now, the focus continues to be making sure that we keep improving the product experience, the selection of partners that we can bring on and the inventory from these partners, the quality of the experience itself, the affordability of these deliveries, as well as the service levels. And so that's really the focus right now on grocery, and again, like the way we think about making these investments is in a fairly disciplined way of making sure that we find product market fit before we actually scale these things out. And so when we do scale these things out, they tend to already have very, very robust unit economics and cohort performance. Hey, James. It's Tony. So, on DashMart, we really like what we see. Again, like this is another one of these newer initiatives about year and a half old. And what we are learning, I think, are benefits really for -- starting with a couple of audiences and I will talk about how it translates into the third audience. So, first, for consumers, a lot of these DashMarts are just bring selection of inventory into geographies where, frankly, didn't previously exist, whether literally never existed or the hours of operation has now opened pretty wide to 24x7 now, which is a big improvement for what consumers are seeking. I think with respect to merchants, this is a critical infrastructure for a lot of them either to expand into new geographies or to increase into different hours of operations and so what we see is really DashMarts on a fairly long investment time horizon. Again, staying disciplined around finding product market fit before we choose to scale these things out, but what we are seeing is quite a lot of demand for them. And I think it really speaks to, again, what we are trying to create at DoorDash, which is really the largest local commerce app or marketplace where we are bringing incremental demand and the largest local commerce platform, where we are building tools and infrastructure, obviously, starting delivery with products like Drive. But if you think about all the other products and services that merchants need to build in order to compete digitally in today's economy, well, it certainly expands far beyond just logistics. And so DashMarts are really a form of infrastructure to store inventory to possibly enter new geographies and certainly expand their hours of service. And so we plan on investing in this line of work for a really long time for those reasons, and obviously, if we can build both a marketplace and a platform with DashMart, I think it provides tremendous work opportunities for Dashers. But again, the investment philosophy stays the same, given how young dash marks are. It's making sure that we have great product market fit and then we will continue to scale them. So on the non-restaurant category what we are seeing is, pretty much quite a lot of different kinds of use cases. Are there people who just shop for impulse purchases for whatever the occasion might be, yes? But predominantly, we are seeing people come back for, I think, a lot of use cases. I mean, where the recurring behavior is looking for that middle of the week run now being solved by somebody else, right? That's really the job that we are solving for a lot of these customers, right? Like when you think about the items near pantry that get consumed the earliest or the items in your refrigerator that maybe perish the earliest, those are the things that actually -- those are the types of things where you have to go back everything in a week, no matter how much you buy on a weekly basis, right, and those are the jobs where people have to do every single week and so we are seeing certainly both, although more of the behavior is recurring. And then I will let Prabir take, I think, your second question, which is really around, I think, the business model. Yeah. Prabir, do you want to take the first... ... and I can take the second. Yeah. And Mark, with respect to your second question on Prop 22, nothing has changed. I mean, we are absolutely right on the law here. In fact, I think even the California Attorney General have supported us in this regard that, 58% to 59% of the state population and voting population are saying that they pass something into law that should be legalized. I think it's just common sense that that's the right legal answer. But I think even more importantly than this, just more broadly speaking, we feel the same way about this issue anywhere in the sense that drivers in this type of economy ought to be able to take wherever they want to work, whenever they want to work and that flexibility is critical. I mean that's what Prop 22 stands for a while giving them the protections that they deserve and we -- whether it's in the State of California or frankly, any geography globally, that's where we stand for, which is to support the Dasher. And the voters of California believe in this, the drivers believe in this and the California Attorney General believes in this. Yeah. Hey. It's Tony. I will take both of those questions. With respect to the first, I think, you are certainly right in saying that we have quite a lot on our plate and we are constantly, again, trying to invent the best possible products. And again, when you think about the portfolio of initiatives of U.S. restaurants, new categories or platform services, international markets and advertising, there's a lot of work to go around. So we always believe that we have to earn the right to serve customers in a second way by doing an excellent job in the first way and so that's really what we are focused on. But look, I mean, it doesn't mean that we are not scanning for opportunities. We are always looking for opportunities regardless, especially when we have such a robust core business that's producing positive cash flow and with a very healthy balance sheet, it gives us lots of opportunities to be opportunistic and go on the offensive. I think with respect to your second question around regulatory preparation. Yes, I mean, this has been -- something that's been a part of DoorDash really since 2013 when the company was founded. And this is -- these beliefs that we have had since day one of making sure that worker's should be able to have this new standard where they get the flexibility that they are telling us over and over again with their words, as well as with their feet. And also the protections that we believe they deserve. And frankly, just like expire outdated laws that deserve to be expired. And we think the productive way in doing this is that governments and businesses such as ourselves should work together across any geography to make sure that this actually happens from the perspective of the worker, not from any other perspective. And so that's what we are working really hard on and we have best-in-class teams to get that work done. Yeah. I will take the first question and maybe Prabir can take the second on the kind of different tiers of commission points. With respect to the first of adding more selection in these new categories, a lot of it is just doing the work quite candidly. I think what has been really attractive to all of these customers is, well, I mean, look at what we are bringing, we are bringing the largest on-demand audience for local commerce that has the highest frequency of shopping. That's an incremental use case both from their physical activities, their own digital activities and other -- any other previous digital partnerships that they have signed. And so, as a result of that, actually, we are seeing quite a lot of excitement where people are starting to think of DoorDash, not just as lunch and dinner, but really everything inside the neighborhood. So we are actually seeing quite a lot of progress. And but that doesn't mean that there isn't work to be done. I mean we have to build a lot of products now that make sense for categories outside of restaurants, right? Everything from the catalog, to the in-store shopping process, to how we think about customer support, to think about how do we support people not just again on our channel, but also their own channel. So there's a lot of work to be done. But I would say that the excitement from partners has been tremendous. I think some of those names you have seen in the press and things like this and we expect adding a lot more partners to come."

These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our website and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. We'll typically go straight into questions, but given the transaction announcement, we'll have Tony and Miki give some brief comments before we go into the Q&A session. For the Q&A, please note that the Miki 's happy to answer questions about his approach to the industry and his rationale for the combination. Please don't ask questions about Wolt financials, or outlook, or future integration plans. Our businesses will remain independent until the deal closes. So we won't be answering those ones at this point. I will now pass it on to Tony.\nTony Xu: Great. Thanks, Andy. Hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today. At DoorDash our mission is to grow and empower local economies. We started in food delivery logistics, and our vision was always to build a platform that supports all of local commerce, and to do it on a global basis. To date, we have executed against this primarily on an organic basis. That's not because we believe that must be done organically, but because our framework for M&A sets a high bar. For those who haven't heard it before, our M&A framework is comprised of 3 core standards. First, it must be talent accretive. We look for teams of superbly talented people that share our vision as well as our approach to execution. Second, we must unlock product categories and, or new geographies. This means that we look for opportunities that expand our TAM, either in a way that we couldn't do so on our own or in a way that is much more efficient than we could do so ourselves. And third, it must increase our long-term profit potential and add to shareholder value. Wolt handling meets all 3 criteria. We believe Wolt brings extraordinary talent, a world-class product, and operational expertise that will accelerate our progress. We've gotten to know Mickey and the Wolt team well over the last few months, in fact, years and believe that they are truly exceptional. They share our ambition to build a global platform for all of global commerce. And they've established a culture based on innovation, intense operational rigor, and a bias for action. These characteristics match our own and we believe our strategic and cultural alignment make them the best team in the world to lead our international efforts. From a market perspective, Wolfe operates in 23 markets of which 22 are new markets for DoorDash. By themselves, we believe these markets provide an opportunity to grow our international business to multiples of what it is today.  This should allow us to invest and expand more efficiently than we could have done on our own and on a faster timeline. Finally, Wolt 's product scales to multiple categories. In certain markets, the Company has already established a strong presence in categories ranging as far as cosmetics and electronics. As we look to grow our non-restaurant categories globally, we expect their product vision and expertise will improve our execution. From a financial perspective, the opportunity in local commerce is enormous. We believe that the potential in our combined markets create a substantial opportunity to grow gross order value to multiples of its current level.  We expect to invest aggressively behind the Wolt team and believe their capabilities will improve our efficiency internationally, while allowing us to increase our focus in the United States. A building -- building a large and profitable local commerce platform is difficult to do in any market. Doing so across many markets simultaneously is exponentially harder. But attacking hard problem -- problems is what we like to do at DoorDash. And we know that the same is true for Volt. We couldn't be happier to be teaming up with Mickey and the extraordinary team at Volt to execute against our shared vision. With that, let me hand it over to Micky.\nMiki Kuusi: Thanks, Tony. Hi, everyone. I'm Micky, co-founder and CEO of Wolfe. So my co-founders and I founded Wolfe back in 2014 with ambition to build a new layer of infrastructure that connects with restaurants and retailers, core years and consumers in a way that made cities better and people happier. We wanted to build the digital version of shopping mall, but with the convenience that a modern logistics engine can enable. We did our first delivery in Helsinki, Finland back in 2015. When we started, we knew a few things would have to be true if we were going to build a scale of a business we envisioned. First of all, we were going to have -- to going to have to expand beyond Finland. In Finland, we have fewer than 6 million people. So to build large business, we were going to have to be international from day 1, we built everything about the service from product logistics, to customer service with the idea of being easily exportable, is allowed us to launch 22 new countries in the 5 years from 2016 to 2020. Secondly, we were going to have to be efficient. In the Nordics, we have a challenging combination of small cities, low population density, higher labor costs and a whole different culture, that means we have to build the business to operate at incredible levels of logistical efficiency in order to generate room for profitability. Thirdly, we have to build the product that consumers locked. It was no room in our margin structure or our bank account to make off for poor quality products with a huge customer acquisition spend. We have to make our marketing spend work by using our product to retain consumers at higher levels than what we saw at competitors. We've been on an incredible journey so far, but believe we are only getting started. We have one chance to build a leading global platform for local commerce by joining forces with the team of DoorDash, we expect to put our combined Company on a path to accelerate our efforts and bring greater levels of value to consumers, merchants, and couriers around the world.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thank you Mickey and Tony. Operating the questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions]. Please standby. We'll be compiling, again, a roster. First question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. You're now live.\nRoss Sandler: Hey guys, I guess we knew this day was going to come eventually with the European Cold War kicking off. But I guess it's Tony, the first question, is it looks like Vault is doing about the same drops for hours, some of their competitors over there, and our understanding if they're number 2 in most of their markets, so I guess, what are you guys bringing to the table, and how might the combination change that and advanced them to the top of the league table. Thanks a lot.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Ross, I'll start and I'll let others here follow. I would say there are three big things that we saw about Wolt that are just really incredible. First and foremost, this is a team that executes in a very similar way to DoorDash. I cannot understate how important that is when we're talking about an execution-oriented business, which is what we find ourselves in. They really competed by building a winning product, by focusing on removing every basis points point of inefficiency, finding every penny of savings and building the business that has compounded its efforts in delighting the customer and doing so in a very capital efficient way. The second thing I would say is they built a remarkable business. I mean, as you saw in the Investor Relations deck that we uploaded, the business has grown to $2.5 billion and annualized gross order value is growing triple digits. It's done so while also growing its bottom line at the same time. And so it's become very, very efficient not only in its drops per hour, which includes idle time, by the way, but also just in how it's thought about everything from the consumer experience in conversion to customer support, to localization and so forth. They built an incredible business when you look at this capital efficiency combined with just how early their markets are, as a standalone business, they just have very large scale to grow into. The final thing I would say is it really represents an accelerated timeline and speed for DoorDash Bolt because of where they started in their home country of Finland, a relatively speaking, smaller country they knew from day 1 in order to achieve the scale of their ambition, they needed to expand into a lot of geographies and they've now grown to 23 markets of which 22 will be new to DoorDash. So the combined team will be able to serve over 700 million people, so not only does it grow our TAM, but it allows DoorDash to have single threaded focus here in accelerating our ability to compete on a bigger global stage.\nPrabir Adarkar: Here, Ross, just to add to Tony's point, deliveries per hours is obviously an important metric but there's across other aspects of the P&L, we were actually amazed by what we saw in terms of voice capital efficiency. The retention is also supportive, and so what I'm trying to say with that is, it actually learning from voltage help increase the efficiency of our own international investments. The second thing -- the second point I'd make is Vault has 4,000 people. And so if you think about what that does to our international organic ability to expand internationally, which is raises our level of focus outside the U.S. And in third, it preserves our existing management bandwidth to go after the large opportunity that exists in the U.S., and allows us to sharpen that focus among in the restaurant category in the U.S. but also in terms of new categories like also inconvenience.\nRoss Sandler: Great, thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line's open.\nDeepak Mathivananr: Great. Congrats on the acquisition. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Tony and one for Miki. Tony, wanted to ask about the drivers supply and utilization here in the U.S. It seems like the driver acquisition trends are still pretty healthy but with various categories on the platform scaling with different on-demand needs for now. Curious on your thoughts on whether it would make sense to deploy a dual model with part-time, full-time model together with the on-demand workforce? What are the things that you are watching, potentially to explore this model? And then, maybe as a follow-up to Ross's question on formally key. I wanted to ask about your thoughts on the broader European markets. Where do you see kind of near to medium-term opportunities to expand next, given that the competitive intensity and some of the Western European markets is very different.\nTony Xu: Hey Deepak, I'll start on the Dasher question and I think there's actually a couple of questions in there. I think the first part is, if you look at dashers, they're actually no different from consumers in the sense that they all value choice. And one of the things that we've seen as with over 3 million dashers, who dash in the quarter earning over $2.8 billion, I think would really go to show is that when we offer flexible opportunities at the platform, it really can be complementary to the traditional labor market. And that's why I think you'd see healthy levels of Dasher supply in the marketplace that has drawn to meet the demand. And as we've gotten into other categories, this is even offering Dashers even more choice and more flexible opportunities, whether it's doing grocery deliveries, convenience deliveries, etc. I think the second part of your question really is around Dasher preference and at the end of the day, we're a platform that always has built what Dasher wanted. And then starting from that basis of offering and what we hear time and again, not just actually in the U.S., but really in all of our markets is how much they value the flexibility to earn. And starting from that basis, and then working backwards with local regulators, elected officials, and anyone else really who wants to create different frameworks that really meets the modern day realities of what it is that workers want. That's what we stand for. Go ahead, Miki.\nMiki Kuusi: Yeah. On competition in Europe, like a lot of people say that it's very intense from where I'm sitting, like it doesn't feel that the intense I guess it's because when you're sitting in the pressure kettle for 7 years, you get used to the pressure. Competition has always been incense in our industry, and I expect it always will be. This is an industry that is ultimately about how you're able to vary efficiency with customer experience. Like the easiest thing in the world is to spend money to have an amazing customer experience, but not unless -- that's not a long-term sustainable business. And when it comes to competition, like our focus is not on competition, our focus is on the customer and providing value for the customer, building an amazing service for the customer. But doing it in an efficient, profitable manner, which allows us to keep on investing for a very long time into bringing more customers in the platform. If I look at Europe, it's still very early in all of our markets and in most of the markets in Europe, as well. So, yes there is competition, there will always be competition, but ultimately it's the game of execution of how you will value the consumer.\nDeepak Mathivananr: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next on our queue is Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Just one really, when you think about what you framed as the potential for EBITDA, looking out to 2022 and how walls fits into that broader framework. Can you talk to us a little bit about your biggest priorities, including executing the ANSYS act would acquisition about what would push you to the upper or lower band with some of those profitability outcomes as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months. Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hi, it's for me and thanks for the question. We're not fall many providing 2022 guidance. Really the purpose of the 0 to 500 EBITDA range was to signal that even post acquisition which by the way, has to go through regulatory review and complete, assuming the deal completes, we expect the combined Company to have adjusted EBITDA. that's loosely new 3 to 1 DoorDash will do on a standalone basis with 2022. And so despite the combination, it doesn't change our priorities. Our priorities still remain. First, to build the number 1 food app in the U.S. Second, to continue adding multiple categories beyond food and expanding the convenience grocery, packed food retail and so on. Third, to continue building the platform side of our business with DoorDash driving store fronts. And then fourth, to continue building a global Company and the Wolt conversation that we're having today is a huge part of that.\nOperator: All right. Next one on the queue is Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan, your line is now open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about DashPass, you talked about the 9 million plus members. So that you could share a little bit more just on their characteristics in terms of frequency, and order size, and perhaps around new vertical adoption relative to non DashPass members. And then you mentioned Canada and Australia share gains but obviously early in some of the international markets, just curious if you expect the offering to work the same way as you expand more internationally going forward. Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hey, Doug, thanks for the question. Yes. We're excited about DashPass, it's our primary affordability play to think about it, because we in a zero delivery fees as well as reduced service fees for DashPass members. The interesting pre -bound DashPass is that it actually helps with the overall retention DashPass members and higher retention compare to those that Mark Hughes DashPass engagement levels of significantly higher. We haven't disclosed exactly how much we hired instead we see DashPass members have a greater tendency to adopt across not just multiple types of products. So delivery and pickup, but also across multiple categories. And so, I view DashPass membership to -- increases a day, leading indicator in terms of future growth, and usually opportunity for us as we think about the size of the membership base to be 9 million. There's millions of other MAUs that currently use DoorDash that aren't DashPass members. And we've got work to do in order to convert them to DashPass numbers. Beyond that, there's millions of other people that don't use DoorDash at all. And so for us, as we continue making advances in terms of selection, both on the restaurant side as well as other categories, improve the quality of the delivery experience and continue to work on affordability. Our hoping that membership base grows. We should guide future growth. On the question on Canada and Australia, we look at it -- it's a slump like it was in the U.S. It comes down to the same 3 vectors of selection, quality, and affordability. And there's no other secret sauce and we'll continue to make progress, improving in all key dimensions, which is strong, leading into retention gains and category savings.\nDouglas Anmuth: Great. Thank you, Prabir.\nOperator: Next one on the queue is Michael McGovern from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael Mcgovern: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just a couple on Wolt, I was wondering, pretty surprising to see such high growth this year in 2021 when we're more post-pandemic and there should be higher mobility having presumably some deceleration on growth. So can you talk about what's driving the outsized growth for Wolt? And it doesn't look like geographic expansion, so is there maybe non restaurant expansion or category expansion that Wolt consume that's contributing to higher growth?\nPrabir Adarkar: Thanks for the question. It's essentially a variety of things that are going I don't want to go into a lot of detail there until the deal closes, but it's not because of adding new countries, it's because of strong retention, it's because of customer acquisition strength, it's because of category expansion into beyond pooling and so. We would like to exactly point that you just observed which is continued strength despite the fact that we're now sitting here towards the end of 2021, 2 years after the pandemic began. All those data points are things that we saw we were excited by and thank you, to testament to the great product experience, and the good part of the Mickey and his team have built.\nMiki Kuusi: Yeah, and I mean, people rate 80 -100 times a month, so if you're talking about like an average market in the frequency of 3 and 4 like the reality is that like we're still a very small part of our customers lives. And if you look at the broader population, most people have never even find a service like us. So we're only getting started when you look at like the market we operate in, expanding the new cities, bringing new merchants on the platform, and increasingly being much more than a restaurant food delivery service, now expanding to retail and other categories. So ultimately, it's an execution game. If you're the best possible provider for the customer, you will have customers using your more frequently, more often on your customers coming to the platform. And that's what we're focused on.\nMichael Mcgovern: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next one on the queue is Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions from me, please. First, on the acquisition, can you maybe just speak to the low level of integration needed for you guys to deliver on the vision? Just trying to understand what are low-hanging fruits versus things that may take longer to execute on? Just considering the large footprints of the acquired Company. And second, maybe you can comment on the Albertsons partnership that you've announced last quarter? Any learnings from that for grocery delivery? I think you had initially talked about a couple thousand stores, and do you anticipate any more partnerships by year-end? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Sure. I'll take both of those. On the first question, this partnership is really about acceleration and expansion to play for a bigger price on an even larger global stage. I think both Wolt and DoorDash has done a remarkable job in building the best product possible in their respective markets. And really, when I think about the combination now serving over 700 million people once the deal is closed from the first half of next year, we have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to keep delighting our customers and offering the best combination of selection, quality, price, and service. And that's true in the restaurants category. That's also true beyond restaurants. So there's a lot of work to do. And in that vein, we really could use all the talented teammates possible. I mean, this partnership is not about cost synergies. This partnership is about the acceleration and expansion, and we're very excited for the long runway ahead. Your second question I think was with respect to Albertson, it's been a fantastic partnership with Albertson, you're right we've now launched across their entire footprint over 2,000 stores. And we continue actually to see other partners added into this category. In fact, in the Third Quarter, we announced over 40,000 non-restaurant stores, including a recent additions of Total Wine & More, Weis Markets and Cardenas Markets in the grocery category, if that's what you're focused on, and also Bed Bath and Beyond. So even beyond food and liquor. As we discussed, there are 4 big areas of work right now at DoorDash, we're building a number 1 food app. We are getting into new categories such as convenience in grocery. Those are relatively new categories where -- I know we're the leading platform in the U.S. in convenience deliveries, but with the long, long ways to go there. We're continuing to invest in services to help merchants build their own digital business with products like DoorDash Drive and Storefront. And obviously, we're making a big announcement today on our international business. And so again, the theme even in both of your questions is, how do we make sure we have single-threaded leadership in order to have both speed and quality of execution across all of these priority areas.\nYoussef Squali: All right. Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: Next one on the queue is Bernie McTernan from Needham & Company. Your line is now open.\nBernie Mcternan: Great. Thanks for taking questions. Just two for me. Tony, as you think about the next 12 to 24 months and isolating the U.S., what do you see is the greater near-term opportunity for you that are increasing the frequency of usage from the base, and as a result, driving more DashPass members? Or just continue to expand the total number of customers on the platform? And then just follow-up on DashPass. The 9 million customers, certainly more than we were expecting and it's been a while since you provide, I think it was last year, you provide the 5 million. Can you talk about the cadence of getting from the 5 million to the 9 million?\nTony Xu: Yeah, I'll take the first one and maybe I'll let Prabir to follow on the second one. So on the first one with respect to just the opportunity in the U.S. we're still pretty early. I know that obviously tell that it was a big accelerator into the business. And in fact, you've seen a lot of the resilience of that consumer behavior stay even though in-store dining has returned to effectively all-time highs according to the latest Census Bureau staff that I saw in Q3. So there's just a lot of work still to do in the restaurants category alone. Yes, we're seeing consumer engagement higher than pre-COVID levels. As Prabir mentioned, there are a lot of customers that have never used DoorDash and certainly our customers that use DoorDash, there's a lot of them that are not a part of DashPass. That's certainly an opportunity. Another big opportunity I would cite is our work into other categories. We are quickly marching into these other categories. In the first quarter, we announced single-digit percentages of our monthly active users having shopped in a non-restaurant category, that number is now up to 12% in the third quarter. But again, these categories of convenience or grocery or alcohol, they're very, very, very young. We think there is a massive runway ahead and certainly a lot of work to do in order to invent, to bring these categories online.\nPrabir Adarkar: Good morning. On your question of K1s, I'm not sure exactly which area you're looking for in your question as the speed at which we've added that's brought service whether the results from jewelry into the pandemic. Let me put it this way. We've had quarter-on-quarter growth in the national membership program every single quarter since we launched the program.\nBernie Mcternan: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Next one in the queue is Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer Company. Your line is now open.\nAndy Hargreaves: Jason are you there? Let's go onto Brad, air the next question and will come back with you on that one.\nOperator: All right. So for the next question, we do have Brad Erickson from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBradley Erickson: Thanks. So just a couple, I guess. One, how should we think about the brands going forward here? Do you go with multiple brands across the markets that are kind of in or just DoorDash, maybe eventually takeover in certain countries? And then second, when you look at the priorities here, once the deal does close, is it really to just focus on the existing countries where, we're both our operating or maybe we'll also look to expand into new countries with either of the brands? Thanks.\nTony Xu: I'll take that one. Hey Brian, I guess crawl walk run like say a lot internally, and first we have to wait for the deal to close, which we expect to happened in the first half of '22. Second point around, I think your question was around brands. Well -- these are hydro local businesses, and at the same time, all these share that global commonality that people, regardless of where they live, eat 3 times a day, and shop in this category over a 100 times a month, and are always seeking more and more convenience. And brands tend to be hyper-local, and so we're going to optimize for, how do we serve customers, merchants, and couriers, in the best possible way in their hyper-local area? In fact, nothing is going to change in terms of the quality of service, certainly day 1, we only expect that to increase over time. And with respect adding to the second part of your question around the existing footprint versus adding footprint, we have a lot of work on our plate. There's 700 million people that post deal close we are going to have to continuously delight. And while we have the benefit and the privilege of living in a high frequency category, we also recognize that as an execution-oriented business where you have to earn every single order and every next order before we can earn the privilege of serving our customers the next time. So not much more to say than that right now besides super excited about the announcement today with a great team that shares our vision as well as the way we operate. And we have a lot of work ahead of us.\nBradley Erickson: That's great. Thanks.\nOperator: Next one on the queue is Steven Fox from Fox Advisors LLC. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. Just on the acquisition, it sounds like there's areas where you both have different kinds of efficiency improvements versus the other. I was wondering how you envision sort of getting best practices out of the 2 platforms? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about the ads growth? I understand you said in the letter you're reinvesting profits from ads, but can you give us some sense for how it's growing and how successful it's been in the last quarter? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Sure. I'll take it first and I'll let?for beer? follow-up on the ads question. With respect to the first question on efficiency, there are no silver bullets in this business. That's what I've learned. I mean, there is literally efficiency everywhere from the consumer shopping experience itself to merchant operations, to customer support, to drive our efficiency, which I think sometimes gets quite a lot of attention. And -- but there is literally a systemic equation in which you have to look at every component part, break it down into its inputs in from first principles, build the best possible combination of selection, quality, price, and service for customers. And you're absolutely right, the Wolt team has done an amazing job with that, the DoorDash team has as well and post deal close, we certainly will share best practices, but there are no silver bullets here. It's an execution-oriented business where you really have to understand how the inputs translate into the outcomes. And you have to work every single variable.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hi Steven. And on the question about ad on, so it's -- we're not disclosing ad revenue at this point. What I would say is we're being careful about how we build it. It's really a merchant service. And it's not an EBITDA play. And what I mean by that is we're taking our time to ensure that we have to remain strong for advertisers while ensuring that the customer experience remains utilized. Ideally, it's related to the customer experience. And then as you pointed out, as we make more progress, those profit dollars will get invested back into growth initiatives as I made the point on going EBITDA play from our perspective.\nSteven Fox: Great, that's all very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Next one on the line is James Lee from Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to get, update on DashMart and you know what are the key learnings that you guys are seeing so far. And what do you need to see for this business to expand, should we think about this business as a complementary business or can it scale to a point into a main product? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Thanks for the question, James. And the way I view our convenience business consists of 1P and 3P offerings. And to defend it from a customer's perspective, all they care about is that they get the selection that they knew that -- the right quality and affordable prices. And so to us, it's a hybrid strategy that involves both 1P and 3P partnerships in order to ensure that the selections available are the best quality in price. On the latter part of your question, at the end of the day, it's to one -- it's a form of selection just like anything else. And allows us because it's first-party to include not just food, include not just grocery, but potentially AirPods or other things that the customer wants in demands. It's a core component of our strategy, we're investing in it, which is part of the second priority I mentioned earlier in the conversation. And you can expect more updates as we make progress, but we're not prepared to disclose today.\nJames Lee: Thank you.\nOperator: Right. Next one on the queue is Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer and Co. Your line is now open.\nJason Helfstein: Thanks, Eric. I'll be making, again, multicasting. I saw you guys just filed the perspectives, but maybe I'll ask this maybe scenario, but how did you think about valuation there? I don't know if there's something you want to share as far as like trailing 12 months revenue or gross profits. So just any thoughts how you thought about valuation. And then in the first quarter, you mentioned 7% of the business is from non-restaurant orders, just any update there? Thanks.\nOperator: Okay. Next on the queue is Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAndy Hargreaves: [Indiscernible]\nOperator: Yeah. Go ahead.\nPrabir Adarkar: [Indiscernible] We didn't disclose the order on new verticals, but what we did say, is that the customers are any use that orders from categories outside of restaurants grew 12% in September and December with single-digit back in Q1. That's where the second question you asked on the question of valuation, we aren't disclosing anything other than the current run rate GMV from -- involved in package you thought about the valuation we looked at the non-term profit potential of the business is given the retention dynamics we're seeing in the unit economics, in ancillary markets as well as the runway getting Wolt currently has 2.5 million MAUs in the countries in which it operates in. These countries have 370 plus million people, so there's a lot of runway for growth, and I do believe in the team and I believe if we execute well, we think we'll generate a very attractive return.\nOperator: All right. Brian Fitzgerald, your line is now open.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, guys. Maybe just a follow-up on both. Can you talk about the level of batching that you've done there historically if you track that, how it has progressed? And then on DoorDash, wanted to know if we gave an update on the reception and the adoption levels of the more recent 15, 25, 30 commission levels, how that's progressing if you're seeing people move out of one bucket into another? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Maybe on the question batching, as I said, look, the Company is operating independently today, we're not going to provide an update on board's matching levels at this time. On the adoption of the pricing tiers, we said last quarter with the majority of [Indiscernible]?mass??transit? choosing either premium or plus new real update on those metrics. Other than to say that the premier mix outperformed our expectations. And the question was really a unit revenue question. Maybe this is a smaller factor versus all of the other movements. And given our investments that hit in our data rate.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney from ISI. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. The presentation describes Finland is having one of the most difficult markets for last mile local logistics. Could you explain why? What's particularly difficult about that market? And I asked that because the follow-up question is, when you think about the attractiveness of the European markets, Eastern, Northern European markets, where this acquisition -- if it's successful will take you. Is there something about those markets that's more or less attractive than what you currently face in terms of regulation, income requirements, and there are some for workers for in classification of workers, etc. So it's just something about those markets that makes them more or less attractive. They can still be intrinsically attractive, but less attractive than the current markets that you're in. Thank you.\nMiki Kuusi: I can maybe start. If you look at our top of the business, like ultimately it's the marriage of efficiency and customer experience. Why it's been this difficult, like Nordic countries have the lowest income disparity in the world. It means that our blended hourly cost is going to be surprisingly close to our average order value. So we need to make the model work by the way of efficiency. There's not really tipping culture. So you have to survive on relatively low delivery fees and commissions. There's not a very strong pre -existing delivery cultures. You have to basically educate consumers to use delivery. And then like cities are not very high density and they are not very big. So you need to be able to succeed environments where order density is not going to be very high for a very long time, if ever. I'm going to top it off like we have very harsh winters. It's a hit stock for most of the year and so forth. So it's just a difficult way to do what we do. And the funny thing is that as we came out of Finland louder than Nordics, we just realized that every other country we saw, was a lot easier for us to do. I guess, like here, like we used to get every single ounce of the mobile to work out a little bit more efficiently to be able to operate.\nTony Xu: Yeah, and Mark, what I would say, or what I'd add to that is I think that what the Wolt team has really proven is, regardless of market, people eat 3 times a day and they're always seeking convenience options. And what's been really attractive about frankly their markets or even larger markets is just how early the runway is, both in the food category as well as beyond.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Ralph Schackart from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nRalph Schackart: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just on that driver supply. Just curious what the trends that you're seeing now that some of the government subsidies are starting to weigh in a number what you talked about the average active, our increasing by about 9% or so. Just curious more on the supply, if you sort of attract and retain drivers in this current environment?\nTony Xu: Yeah. I can study -- dasher supplier I think has been very very healthy in the second and the third quarter. And I think again what you see is just, again, over 90% of these dashers work fewer than 10 hours a week. And then the average dasher is under 5 hours a week. And so if you think about just the nature of that work, it truly it's very different and frankly very complementary to a traditional job. As a result of which that's why we saw over 3 million Dashers in the quarter that have earned over $2.8 billion, and Dasher pay has actually increased by over 30% per active hour. And so it's been very healthy, but this is, again, a business where it's very, very dynamic. As we head into Q4 with seasonality we're going to have to make certain preparations and changes and we saw that also with Exogynist influences vol, in Q1 with some of the stimulus money coming in and driving up demand and so, but in general though, because of the nature of the work and how flexible it is, Dasher supplies have been relatively healthy.\nRalph Schackart: Okay, great. Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Potter: Great. Thanks very much. I was hoping you could give an update on drive. I know, historically you haven't wanted to disclose specifics there, but maybe just qualitative. How is drive been going? And then a follow-up question also related to drive. Is there an analogous sort of white-label service with Vault? I know that historically the European markets maybe have been more mom-and-pop less sort of large franchises, I'm just curious the extent to which you'd consider a white-label offering in Europe, as well. Thanks.\nTony Xu: Sure. I'll start. On Drive you're absolutely right, I mean, it's the -- Drive is the business that we've launched now for over 5 years, which really started in 2016. And it really started as a service to help restaurants build around digital business for on-demand delivery, but since, it's really grown into the last-mile logistics system for all retailers. I mean, it's -- we're [Indiscernible], I guess the work is -- businesses is really across every category, whether it'd be grocery or health and beauty or general merchandise. We've seen it across the board, and so the drive business has really diversified as well. We believe a long way to go in building a platform services business in which we not only want to create the largest local commerce marketplace, we also want to build the largest local commerce platform. We have to help these businesses, certainly with logistics that's one component, but everything from customer acquisition to customer service are things that you're going to have to do as a business owner in order to build additional business. And so we have quite a long way to go on the platform services road map, drive is a huge part of it. And we're excited to bring it to most places.\nAlexander Potter: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Again, if you would like to ask a question, [ Operator Instruction ] Next one on the queue is Robert Mallings from Gordon Haskett Research. Your line is now open.\nRobert Mollins: Thank you. Tony, when you look at heavy users that aren't DashPass members, what are some of the reasons those consumers haven't signed up, and what levers can you call it to change that?\nTony Xu: Yeah, it's a great question. So again, customers value or are evaluating us across four dimensions. The selection of stores. The quality of the delivery experience as measured by speed and timing and it's accuracy. Certainly the affordability the program which you're referencing DashPass and customer support. And so those are all of the things that we have to get right to be a valuable enough service where we can earn the privilege of getting a DashPass members. And you can see that, we're doing work in all of these areas. There isn't necessarily one thing that we can do to drive up membership. It's really working on all of the inputs. I mean, big part of selection in addition to adding more and more restaurants and different ways of interacting, those restaurants. Not only the leading platform for delivery in the U.S. but also the leading platform for pickup, for example, in the U.S. is other categories. And as mentioned both in our shareholder letter, the progression from low-single-digits or single-digit percentages in Q1 of our active user base trying a non-restaurants categories and now 12% in the Third Quarter, I mean, that's showing some of that progression. But we have a long way to go there. The quality is something that we're constantly obsessing over, constantly trying to shave seconds and minutes of inefficiency out of the system. Company trying to improve our accuracy. As well as just making it easier also, for deliveries to be completed on our platform. And with respect to service and affordability, we're always trying to deliver more value to consumers, more value to merchants, and more value Dasher. So a lot of work remains to be done, no single silver bullet, but it's really about working the inputs to offer the best combination so that we can earn the privilege of having more members into DashPass.\nRobert Mollins: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Right. That was our last question. I will now turn the call over back to Andy Hargreaves.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thank you everybody for joining us and thank you Tony, Miki and Prabir. We will talk to you all soon. Have a great evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Miki Kuusi",
            "content": "Thanks, Tony. Hi, everyone. I'm Micky, co-founder and CEO of Wolfe. So my co-founders and I founded Wolfe back in 2014 with ambition to build a new layer of infrastructure that connects with restaurants and retailers, core years and consumers in a way that made cities better and people happier. We wanted to build the digital version of shopping mall, but with the convenience that a modern logistics engine can enable. We did our first delivery in Helsinki, Finland back in 2015. When we started, we knew a few things would have to be true if we were going to build a scale of a business we envisioned. First of all, we were going to have -- to going to have to expand beyond Finland. In Finland, we have fewer than 6 million people. So to build large business, we were going to have to be international from day 1, we built everything about the service from product logistics, to customer service with the idea of being easily exportable, is allowed us to launch 22 new countries in the 5 years from 2016 to 2020. Secondly, we were going to have to be efficient. In the Nordics, we have a challenging combination of small cities, low population density, higher labor costs and a whole different culture, that means we have to build the business to operate at incredible levels of logistical efficiency in order to generate room for profitability. Thirdly, we have to build the product that consumers locked. It was no room in our margin structure or our bank account to make off for poor quality products with a huge customer acquisition spend. We have to make our marketing spend work by using our product to retain consumers at higher levels than what we saw at competitors. We've been on an incredible journey so far, but believe we are only getting started. We have one chance to build a leading global platform for local commerce by joining forces with the team of DoorDash, we expect to put our combined Company on a path to accelerate our efforts and bring greater levels of value to consumers, merchants, and couriers around the world. Yeah. On competition in Europe, like a lot of people say that it's very intense from where I'm sitting, like it doesn't feel that the intense I guess it's because when you're sitting in the pressure kettle for 7 years, you get used to the pressure. Competition has always been incense in our industry, and I expect it always will be. This is an industry that is ultimately about how you're able to vary efficiency with customer experience. Like the easiest thing in the world is to spend money to have an amazing customer experience, but not unless -- that's not a long-term sustainable business. And when it comes to competition, like our focus is not on competition, our focus is on the customer and providing value for the customer, building an amazing service for the customer. But doing it in an efficient, profitable manner, which allows us to keep on investing for a very long time into bringing more customers in the platform. If I look at Europe, it's still very early in all of our markets and in most of the markets in Europe, as well. So, yes there is competition, there will always be competition, but ultimately it's the game of execution of how you will value the consumer. Yeah, and I mean, people rate 80 -100 times a month, so if you're talking about like an average market in the frequency of 3 and 4 like the reality is that like we're still a very small part of our customers lives. And if you look at the broader population, most people have never even find a service like us. So we're only getting started when you look at like the market we operate in, expanding the new cities, bringing new merchants on the platform, and increasingly being much more than a restaurant food delivery service, now expanding to retail and other categories. So ultimately, it's an execution game. If you're the best possible provider for the customer, you will have customers using your more frequently, more often on your customers coming to the platform. And that's what we're focused on. I can maybe start. If you look at our top of the business, like ultimately it's the marriage of efficiency and customer experience. Why it's been this difficult, like Nordic countries have the lowest income disparity in the world. It means that our blended hourly cost is going to be surprisingly close to our average order value. So we need to make the model work by the way of efficiency. There's not really tipping culture. So you have to survive on relatively low delivery fees and commissions. There's not a very strong pre -existing delivery cultures. You have to basically educate consumers to use delivery. And then like cities are not very high density and they are not very big. So you need to be able to succeed environments where order density is not going to be very high for a very long time, if ever. I'm going to top it off like we have very harsh winters. It's a hit stock for most of the year and so forth. So it's just a difficult way to do what we do. And the funny thing is that as we came out of Finland louder than Nordics, we just realized that every other country we saw, was a lot easier for us to do. I guess, like here, like we used to get every single ounce of the mobile to work out a little bit more efficiently to be able to operate."

            "content": "Here, Ross, just to add to Tony's point, deliveries per hours is obviously an important metric but there's across other aspects of the P&L, we were actually amazed by what we saw in terms of voice capital efficiency. The retention is also supportive, and so what I'm trying to say with that is, it actually learning from voltage help increase the efficiency of our own international investments. The second thing -- the second point I'd make is Vault has 4,000 people. And so if you think about what that does to our international organic ability to expand internationally, which is raises our level of focus outside the U.S. And in third, it preserves our existing management bandwidth to go after the large opportunity that exists in the U.S., and allows us to sharpen that focus among in the restaurant category in the U.S. but also in terms of new categories like also inconvenience. Hi, it's for me and thanks for the question. We're not fall many providing 2022 guidance. Really the purpose of the 0 to 500 EBITDA range was to signal that even post acquisition which by the way, has to go through regulatory review and complete, assuming the deal completes, we expect the combined Company to have adjusted EBITDA. that's loosely new 3 to 1 DoorDash will do on a standalone basis with 2022. And so despite the combination, it doesn't change our priorities. Our priorities still remain. First, to build the number 1 food app in the U.S. Second, to continue adding multiple categories beyond food and expanding the convenience grocery, packed food retail and so on. Third, to continue building the platform side of our business with DoorDash driving store fronts. And then fourth, to continue building a global Company and the Wolt conversation that we're having today is a huge part of that. Hey, Doug, thanks for the question. Yes. We're excited about DashPass, it's our primary affordability play to think about it, because we in a zero delivery fees as well as reduced service fees for DashPass members. The interesting pre -bound DashPass is that it actually helps with the overall retention DashPass members and higher retention compare to those that Mark Hughes DashPass engagement levels of significantly higher. We haven't disclosed exactly how much we hired instead we see DashPass members have a greater tendency to adopt across not just multiple types of products. So delivery and pickup, but also across multiple categories. And so, I view DashPass membership to -- increases a day, leading indicator in terms of future growth, and usually opportunity for us as we think about the size of the membership base to be 9 million. There's millions of other MAUs that currently use DoorDash that aren't DashPass members. And we've got work to do in order to convert them to DashPass numbers. Beyond that, there's millions of other people that don't use DoorDash at all. And so for us, as we continue making advances in terms of selection, both on the restaurant side as well as other categories, improve the quality of the delivery experience and continue to work on affordability. Our hoping that membership base grows. We should guide future growth. On the question on Canada and Australia, we look at it -- it's a slump like it was in the U.S. It comes down to the same 3 vectors of selection, quality, and affordability. And there's no other secret sauce and we'll continue to make progress, improving in all key dimensions, which is strong, leading into retention gains and category savings. Thanks for the question. It's essentially a variety of things that are going I don't want to go into a lot of detail there until the deal closes, but it's not because of adding new countries, it's because of strong retention, it's because of customer acquisition strength, it's because of category expansion into beyond pooling and so. We would like to exactly point that you just observed which is continued strength despite the fact that we're now sitting here towards the end of 2021, 2 years after the pandemic began. All those data points are things that we saw we were excited by and thank you, to testament to the great product experience, and the good part of the Mickey and his team have built. Good morning. On your question of K1s, I'm not sure exactly which area you're looking for in your question as the speed at which we've added that's brought service whether the results from jewelry into the pandemic. Let me put it this way. We've had quarter-on-quarter growth in the national membership program every single quarter since we launched the program. Hi Steven. And on the question about ad on, so it's -- we're not disclosing ad revenue at this point. What I would say is we're being careful about how we build it. It's really a merchant service. And it's not an EBITDA play. And what I mean by that is we're taking our time to ensure that we have to remain strong for advertisers while ensuring that the customer experience remains utilized. Ideally, it's related to the customer experience. And then as you pointed out, as we make more progress, those profit dollars will get invested back into growth initiatives as I made the point on going EBITDA play from our perspective. Thanks for the question, James. And the way I view our convenience business consists of 1P and 3P offerings. And to defend it from a customer's perspective, all they care about is that they get the selection that they knew that -- the right quality and affordable prices. And so to us, it's a hybrid strategy that involves both 1P and 3P partnerships in order to ensure that the selections available are the best quality in price. On the latter part of your question, at the end of the day, it's to one -- it's a form of selection just like anything else. And allows us because it's first-party to include not just food, include not just grocery, but potentially AirPods or other things that the customer wants in demands. It's a core component of our strategy, we're investing in it, which is part of the second priority I mentioned earlier in the conversation. And you can expect more updates as we make progress, but we're not prepared to disclose today. [Indiscernible] We didn't disclose the order on new verticals, but what we did say, is that the customers are any use that orders from categories outside of restaurants grew 12% in September and December with single-digit back in Q1. That's where the second question you asked on the question of valuation, we aren't disclosing anything other than the current run rate GMV from -- involved in package you thought about the valuation we looked at the non-term profit potential of the business is given the retention dynamics we're seeing in the unit economics, in ancillary markets as well as the runway getting Wolt currently has 2.5 million MAUs in the countries in which it operates in. These countries have 370 plus million people, so there's a lot of runway for growth, and I do believe in the team and I believe if we execute well, we think we'll generate a very attractive return. Maybe on the question batching, as I said, look, the Company is operating independently today, we're not going to provide an update on board's matching levels at this time. On the adoption of the pricing tiers, we said last quarter with the majority of [Indiscernible]?mass??transit? choosing either premium or plus new real update on those metrics. Other than to say that the premier mix outperformed our expectations. And the question was really a unit revenue question. Maybe this is a smaller factor versus all of the other movements. And given our investments that hit in our data rate."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Andy. Hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today. At DoorDash our mission is to grow and empower local economies. We started in food delivery logistics, and our vision was always to build a platform that supports all of local commerce, and to do it on a global basis. To date, we have executed against this primarily on an organic basis. That's not because we believe that must be done organically, but because our framework for M&A sets a high bar. For those who haven't heard it before, our M&A framework is comprised of 3 core standards. First, it must be talent accretive. We look for teams of superbly talented people that share our vision as well as our approach to execution. Second, we must unlock product categories and, or new geographies. This means that we look for opportunities that expand our TAM, either in a way that we couldn't do so on our own or in a way that is much more efficient than we could do so ourselves. And third, it must increase our long-term profit potential and add to shareholder value. Wolt handling meets all 3 criteria. We believe Wolt brings extraordinary talent, a world-class product, and operational expertise that will accelerate our progress. We've gotten to know Mickey and the Wolt team well over the last few months, in fact, years and believe that they are truly exceptional. They share our ambition to build a global platform for all of global commerce. And they've established a culture based on innovation, intense operational rigor, and a bias for action. These characteristics match our own and we believe our strategic and cultural alignment make them the best team in the world to lead our international efforts. From a market perspective, Wolfe operates in 23 markets of which 22 are new markets for DoorDash. By themselves, we believe these markets provide an opportunity to grow our international business to multiples of what it is today.  This should allow us to invest and expand more efficiently than we could have done on our own and on a faster timeline. Finally, Wolt 's product scales to multiple categories. In certain markets, the Company has already established a strong presence in categories ranging as far as cosmetics and electronics. As we look to grow our non-restaurant categories globally, we expect their product vision and expertise will improve our execution. From a financial perspective, the opportunity in local commerce is enormous. We believe that the potential in our combined markets create a substantial opportunity to grow gross order value to multiples of its current level.  We expect to invest aggressively behind the Wolt team and believe their capabilities will improve our efficiency internationally, while allowing us to increase our focus in the United States. A building -- building a large and profitable local commerce platform is difficult to do in any market. Doing so across many markets simultaneously is exponentially harder. But attacking hard problem -- problems is what we like to do at DoorDash. And we know that the same is true for Volt. We couldn't be happier to be teaming up with Mickey and the extraordinary team at Volt to execute against our shared vision. With that, let me hand it over to Micky. Yeah. Hey, Ross, I'll start and I'll let others here follow. I would say there are three big things that we saw about Wolt that are just really incredible. First and foremost, this is a team that executes in a very similar way to DoorDash. I cannot understate how important that is when we're talking about an execution-oriented business, which is what we find ourselves in. They really competed by building a winning product, by focusing on removing every basis points point of inefficiency, finding every penny of savings and building the business that has compounded its efforts in delighting the customer and doing so in a very capital efficient way. The second thing I would say is they built a remarkable business. I mean, as you saw in the Investor Relations deck that we uploaded, the business has grown to $2.5 billion and annualized gross order value is growing triple digits. It's done so while also growing its bottom line at the same time. And so it's become very, very efficient not only in its drops per hour, which includes idle time, by the way, but also just in how it's thought about everything from the consumer experience in conversion to customer support, to localization and so forth. They built an incredible business when you look at this capital efficiency combined with just how early their markets are, as a standalone business, they just have very large scale to grow into. The final thing I would say is it really represents an accelerated timeline and speed for DoorDash Bolt because of where they started in their home country of Finland, a relatively speaking, smaller country they knew from day 1 in order to achieve the scale of their ambition, they needed to expand into a lot of geographies and they've now grown to 23 markets of which 22 will be new to DoorDash. So the combined team will be able to serve over 700 million people, so not only does it grow our TAM, but it allows DoorDash to have single threaded focus here in accelerating our ability to compete on a bigger global stage. Hey Deepak, I'll start on the Dasher question and I think there's actually a couple of questions in there. I think the first part is, if you look at dashers, they're actually no different from consumers in the sense that they all value choice. And one of the things that we've seen as with over 3 million dashers, who dash in the quarter earning over $2.8 billion, I think would really go to show is that when we offer flexible opportunities at the platform, it really can be complementary to the traditional labor market. And that's why I think you'd see healthy levels of Dasher supply in the marketplace that has drawn to meet the demand. And as we've gotten into other categories, this is even offering Dashers even more choice and more flexible opportunities, whether it's doing grocery deliveries, convenience deliveries, etc. I think the second part of your question really is around Dasher preference and at the end of the day, we're a platform that always has built what Dasher wanted. And then starting from that basis of offering and what we hear time and again, not just actually in the U.S., but really in all of our markets is how much they value the flexibility to earn. And starting from that basis, and then working backwards with local regulators, elected officials, and anyone else really who wants to create different frameworks that really meets the modern day realities of what it is that workers want. That's what we stand for. Go ahead, Miki. Sure. I'll take both of those. On the first question, this partnership is really about acceleration and expansion to play for a bigger price on an even larger global stage. I think both Wolt and DoorDash has done a remarkable job in building the best product possible in their respective markets. And really, when I think about the combination now serving over 700 million people once the deal is closed from the first half of next year, we have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to keep delighting our customers and offering the best combination of selection, quality, price, and service. And that's true in the restaurants category. That's also true beyond restaurants. So there's a lot of work to do. And in that vein, we really could use all the talented teammates possible. I mean, this partnership is not about cost synergies. This partnership is about the acceleration and expansion, and we're very excited for the long runway ahead. Your second question I think was with respect to Albertson, it's been a fantastic partnership with Albertson, you're right we've now launched across their entire footprint over 2,000 stores. And we continue actually to see other partners added into this category. In fact, in the Third Quarter, we announced over 40,000 non-restaurant stores, including a recent additions of Total Wine & More, Weis Markets and Cardenas Markets in the grocery category, if that's what you're focused on, and also Bed Bath and Beyond. So even beyond food and liquor. As we discussed, there are 4 big areas of work right now at DoorDash, we're building a number 1 food app. We are getting into new categories such as convenience in grocery. Those are relatively new categories where -- I know we're the leading platform in the U.S. in convenience deliveries, but with the long, long ways to go there. We're continuing to invest in services to help merchants build their own digital business with products like DoorDash Drive and Storefront. And obviously, we're making a big announcement today on our international business. And so again, the theme even in both of your questions is, how do we make sure we have single-threaded leadership in order to have both speed and quality of execution across all of these priority areas. Yeah, I'll take the first one and maybe I'll let Prabir to follow on the second one. So on the first one with respect to just the opportunity in the U.S. we're still pretty early. I know that obviously tell that it was a big accelerator into the business. And in fact, you've seen a lot of the resilience of that consumer behavior stay even though in-store dining has returned to effectively all-time highs according to the latest Census Bureau staff that I saw in Q3. So there's just a lot of work still to do in the restaurants category alone. Yes, we're seeing consumer engagement higher than pre-COVID levels. As Prabir mentioned, there are a lot of customers that have never used DoorDash and certainly our customers that use DoorDash, there's a lot of them that are not a part of DashPass. That's certainly an opportunity. Another big opportunity I would cite is our work into other categories. We are quickly marching into these other categories. In the first quarter, we announced single-digit percentages of our monthly active users having shopped in a non-restaurant category, that number is now up to 12% in the third quarter. But again, these categories of convenience or grocery or alcohol, they're very, very, very young. We think there is a massive runway ahead and certainly a lot of work to do in order to invent, to bring these categories online. I'll take that one. Hey Brian, I guess crawl walk run like say a lot internally, and first we have to wait for the deal to close, which we expect to happened in the first half of '22. Second point around, I think your question was around brands. Well -- these are hydro local businesses, and at the same time, all these share that global commonality that people, regardless of where they live, eat 3 times a day, and shop in this category over a 100 times a month, and are always seeking more and more convenience. And brands tend to be hyper-local, and so we're going to optimize for, how do we serve customers, merchants, and couriers, in the best possible way in their hyper-local area? In fact, nothing is going to change in terms of the quality of service, certainly day 1, we only expect that to increase over time. And with respect adding to the second part of your question around the existing footprint versus adding footprint, we have a lot of work on our plate. There's 700 million people that post deal close we are going to have to continuously delight. And while we have the benefit and the privilege of living in a high frequency category, we also recognize that as an execution-oriented business where you have to earn every single order and every next order before we can earn the privilege of serving our customers the next time. So not much more to say than that right now besides super excited about the announcement today with a great team that shares our vision as well as the way we operate. And we have a lot of work ahead of us. Sure. I'll take it first and I'll let?for beer? follow-up on the ads question. With respect to the first question on efficiency, there are no silver bullets in this business. That's what I've learned. I mean, there is literally efficiency everywhere from the consumer shopping experience itself to merchant operations, to customer support, to drive our efficiency, which I think sometimes gets quite a lot of attention. And -- but there is literally a systemic equation in which you have to look at every component part, break it down into its inputs in from first principles, build the best possible combination of selection, quality, price, and service for customers. And you're absolutely right, the Wolt team has done an amazing job with that, the DoorDash team has as well and post deal close, we certainly will share best practices, but there are no silver bullets here. It's an execution-oriented business where you really have to understand how the inputs translate into the outcomes. And you have to work every single variable. Yeah, and Mark, what I would say, or what I'd add to that is I think that what the Wolt team has really proven is, regardless of market, people eat 3 times a day and they're always seeking convenience options. And what's been really attractive about frankly their markets or even larger markets is just how early the runway is, both in the food category as well as beyond. Yeah. I can study -- dasher supplier I think has been very very healthy in the second and the third quarter. And I think again what you see is just, again, over 90% of these dashers work fewer than 10 hours a week. And then the average dasher is under 5 hours a week. And so if you think about just the nature of that work, it truly it's very different and frankly very complementary to a traditional job. As a result of which that's why we saw over 3 million Dashers in the quarter that have earned over $2.8 billion, and Dasher pay has actually increased by over 30% per active hour. And so it's been very healthy, but this is, again, a business where it's very, very dynamic. As we head into Q4 with seasonality we're going to have to make certain preparations and changes and we saw that also with Exogynist influences vol, in Q1 with some of the stimulus money coming in and driving up demand and so, but in general though, because of the nature of the work and how flexible it is, Dasher supplies have been relatively healthy. Sure. I'll start. On Drive you're absolutely right, I mean, it's the -- Drive is the business that we've launched now for over 5 years, which really started in 2016. And it really started as a service to help restaurants build around digital business for on-demand delivery, but since, it's really grown into the last-mile logistics system for all retailers. I mean, it's -- we're [Indiscernible], I guess the work is -- businesses is really across every category, whether it'd be grocery or health and beauty or general merchandise. We've seen it across the board, and so the drive business has really diversified as well. We believe a long way to go in building a platform services business in which we not only want to create the largest local commerce marketplace, we also want to build the largest local commerce platform. We have to help these businesses, certainly with logistics that's one component, but everything from customer acquisition to customer service are things that you're going to have to do as a business owner in order to build additional business. And so we have quite a long way to go on the platform services road map, drive is a huge part of it. And we're excited to bring it to most places. Yeah, it's a great question. So again, customers value or are evaluating us across four dimensions. The selection of stores. The quality of the delivery experience as measured by speed and timing and it's accuracy. Certainly the affordability the program which you're referencing DashPass and customer support. And so those are all of the things that we have to get right to be a valuable enough service where we can earn the privilege of getting a DashPass members. And you can see that, we're doing work in all of these areas. There isn't necessarily one thing that we can do to drive up membership. It's really working on all of the inputs. I mean, big part of selection in addition to adding more and more restaurants and different ways of interacting, those restaurants. Not only the leading platform for delivery in the U.S. but also the leading platform for pickup, for example, in the U.S. is other categories. And as mentioned both in our shareholder letter, the progression from low-single-digits or single-digit percentages in Q1 of our active user base trying a non-restaurants categories and now 12% in the Third Quarter, I mean, that's showing some of that progression. But we have a long way to go there. The quality is something that we're constantly obsessing over, constantly trying to shave seconds and minutes of inefficiency out of the system. Company trying to improve our accuracy. As well as just making it easier also, for deliveries to be completed on our platform. And with respect to service and affordability, we're always trying to deliver more value to consumers, more value to merchants, and more value Dasher. So a lot of work remains to be done, no single silver bullet, but it's really about working the inputs to offer the best combination so that we can earn the privilege of having more members into DashPass."

Grace, we\u2019ll go straight into questions today. So please go ahead and take the first question.\nOperator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Two questions. Tony, your non-restaurant delivery business has several strategies in place, both in marketplace and in drive. What are you most excited about thus far? What's adding the most to your financial performance? And second question is, in the letter, you mentioned that same-store sales for your merchants is up about 35%. I assume that's dramatically higher than anybody in the peer set. But if overall GOV starts to decelerate and normalize next year, how does that work as far as continuing to add merchants while growing same-store sales and any thought on how you balanced out that and what that might mean for merchant retention? Thanks a lot, guys. Nice quarter.\nTony Xu: Great. Hey Ross. I'll take the first question and I'll let Prabir start the second. So, on the first question with respect to new categories, I mean, you're right. We're super excited about our progress. In Q1, we announced that, about 70% of our business was coming from orders outside of restaurants, and that has grown sequentially and it's grown certainly faster than our restaurants business. And it does touch upon the strategy of creating both in marketplace where we're generating incremental demand and really building best-in-class point solutions category-by-category or bringing everything inside the neighborhood to consumers in minutes, not hours or days. And then on the other side, we are also building a first-party capability on behalf of retailers and merchants, so that they can create their own digital businesses. The goal of DoorDash has always been to create the largest local commerce marketplace as well as the largest local commerce platform. And we think that this strategy is certainly playing out, not just in our core and original category of restaurants, but now also heading into other categories.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Ross, just to add-on to Tony\u2019s point. The reason we are excited about these new categories, both in our marketplace and primarily in the marketplace in addition to drive is the \u2013 what the early data suggests is that when consumers buy from other categories in our marketplace in addition to the food category, they subsequently now then increase their retention and engagement with the marketplace as a whole compared to customers who do not buy across categories. And so we're seeing this behavior, it's super exciting, it's improving the value proposition of DashPass, which is why we're investing behind it both on the marketplace as well as for drive. Now for drive, it\u2019s a slightly different strategy because we don't own the customer into the drive. But as we add more orders from other categories to the ecosystem, we're just creating node density and order density that I think it lowers our cost structure, and then the rest of the flywheel. So that's the first part of your question. On the second question, I think, I understand what you're getting at. But the way I view it is first, if you think of it from a merchant standpoint, the marketplace GOV is just one portion of the sales that we generate. It doesn't capture the value of drive orders, right? So remember that. So the true sales from a merchant perspective is very different than the \u2013 than what's implied by the GOV growth. The second is if you look at what's happened to our order frequency over time, we're currently at all-time highs. And that - the order frequency is high both for our DashPass subscribers as well as for non-DashPass users. And so both sets of \u2013 both cohorts of users had actually achieved not just year-on-year, but lifetime high order frequency. And that will continue to increase over time as our selection improves, as the affordability improves and as quality improves, and that will then continue to have GOV growth for our merchants.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, sir.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, guys. I had two questions. One was around the beat and the guidance. How much of that was driven by international versus new categories? If you could parse that out or give us some color on that? And then could you talk to the kind of different take rates or pricing points you rolled out last quarter. Can you talk to us about the adoption rates? Is there a tendency to move up or down versus cohorts of somebody who started at a certain percentage and then started moving up to 25% to 35%? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Sure. So Brian, on the first question, we basically saw strength across the Board and just core consumer metrics, right? So it wasn't that one part of our business beat and other didn\u2019t. But across the Board, we started to see, as I alluded to earlier, strong order frequency development, you saw pick up on DashPass subs not just in the U.S., but also growth in our international region. As a matter of fact, our international business actually grew faster both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year compared to our U.S. business. We have continued to see strength on retention and order frequency for our consumer cohorts, both those cohorts that were acquired this year compared to new cohort we had pre-COVID and retention and order frequency benefits our existing cohorts that were acquired prior to the pandemic. So across both new cohorts and existing cohorts, retention and order frequency continues to be above pre-COVID levels. So long way of saying, we are seeing strength across all these fundamental consumer metrics that then ultimately led to order volume beat that then translated to GOV in the rest of P&L. On your question around the buy-side packages, what I would say is the majority of restaurants have chosen either the premium or the plus package and the premium mix actually is outperforming our expectations. And so on the whole, it's performing in line with a slightly better than expectations. If it's a take rate question, I don't think the impact on our take rate will be noticeable because there's other factors like DashPass mix and fundamental efficiency improvements that usually are much larger in magnitude than the shifts that are created by the pricing packages.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Very clear. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is open, sir.\nYoussef Squali: Yes. Two questions for me. When I read the letter, I noticed that it's really peppered by language mostly about higher - the need for a higher level of investment. So can you maybe quantify the higher level of investment in DoorDash supply and new categories and international kind of that you qualified? How long do you think or do you anticipate this investment cycle to last some kind of \u2013 just kind of the \u2013 what's the primary driver? You've obviously been aggressively investing to date, but it seems like this is a step up from what you've been doing so far. Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hi, Youssef. So maybe just a bigger step back, I just want to reiterate and remind people of how we manage the business and the philosophy, which is we\u2019re super early in terms of the opportunity, not just in food, but also in the ad and these other categories that were what now recently entered into such as convenience, grocery, packed food, icon and others. So we're a tiny, tiny fraction of the potential of these categories. And that's why we're investing. So if you take a look at where we're investing, it's largely driven by new categories and to build our international business. We're not going to break out the quantum of the investment, but I will say that we are fortunate and that we've got in U.S. business that is firstly, large; second, growing; and third, has improving margins, which then creates a larger profit pool that we can then use to invest in these other opportunities that are ahead of us.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping you just talk a little bit more about the Japan market launch. I know it's fairly new, but just curious what some of the nuances are in that market relative to the U.S., and then if you could also talk about how you're thinking about Europe as well? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. I mean, Japan, we launched the market. I don\u2019t even think it's been two months, so it's too early to draw any conclusions. But whenever we launched these markets in the beginning, we're super focused on, I'm going to call it product market parameters more so than actual financial parameters. So let me describe what I mean. We are looking for retention improvements. We are looking for order frequency improvement. We are looking to ensure that customers aren't retaining simply for discounts versus creating a habit with us. And so, again, it's been two months. I don't want to \u2013 it's too early to declare victory or anything like that, but we're encouraged by what we see. We are currently in one market, which is largely \u2013 which is Sendai. And what we're noticing is that the opportunity is available because these markets are relatively under-penetrated compared to core urban city centers. And so lots more work to do, and we'll keep you posted on the progress. And in terms of just other geographies, I mean, I'll just remind you of our authorities, one of which is to become an international company and we exist in \u2013 we operate in Canada and Australia and Japan today. And over time, as these other markets get bigger and start generating profit pools and we can afford to do so, we will expand obviously in an economically efficient manner in other geographies.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Brad Erickson from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.\nBradley Erickson: Hey, thanks. I guess two for me. One, just within the guidance, it seems like you're looking for Q4, maybe a little bit less than seasonally normal. Is that just a reflection of your comments on the letter around uncertainty? Or is there something else instructing that view? And feel free to recharacterize that view if you want. And then second, follow-up from an earlier question. You've had a ton of gross profit upside here over the past few quarters, and I guess, in the letter, obviously, talking towards reinvestment in a few areas. Can you just remind investors as to how the team views those choices philosophically as you trade off growth versus profitability? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Sure. So Brad, on the first question with respect to the guidance, let me start by saying, so Q1 was elevated a little bit because of a couple of things. These markets have just begun to reopen, vaccination rates were lower, and then to compound all of that, you had the \u2013 let's call it the inorganic impact of stimulus checks there was driving consumer demand. And so that will add to an elevated Q1. As we look into the second half of the year and what\u2019s embedded in our guidance is really two things. The first is, where I call, ordinary course of summer seasonality. So in general, in Q3, we see the pace of consumer acquisition slows a little bit and you have lower order rates simply because consumers are going out during the summer because the weather improves. So that's one aspect. The second is we are baking in a level of conservatism because there is uncertainty in terms of what the world looks like in second half of the year as markets continue reopening. It's unclear whether we're even out of the pandemic at this point and so what the long-term effects are. And so there's plenty of unknowns here as a result of which we wanted to make sure we embed that uncertainty into our second half outlook. On your gross profit upside question, the way to think about it is we invest flexibility across the P&L. One of the reasons we do not provide revenue guidance but instead provide GOV guidance and EBITDA guidance is because depending on the opportunities that are available to us, we can take one of several actions in order to drive growth. We can invest through sales and marketing in terms of customer acquisition or Dasher acquisition. We can invest in pricing through lower prices that will then impact take rate or we can invest in incentives to drive up quality. We should then have further downstream impacts on the take rate as well as on our cost of sales. So we retained that flexibility because depending on the environment we're in, and depending on the exact challenges, we want to be able to deploy the right strategy without having to worry about revenue guide. Now as you look to the future, the factors that will continue to improve take rate, and I'll go through those just as a reminder for people is first, as we improve the efficiency of the logistics network that'll have a positive impact on take rate. As we improve the quality of the consumer experience, that will lower our refunds and credits and have a positive impact on take rate. As we do more \u2013 as we drive more drive orders, no pun intended. As we do more drive orders, that'll have a positive impact in take rate. In terms of headwinds to take rate, it's really three things. As we drive increased mix of DashPass orders, I'll remind folks that the DashPass orders, we have lower unit revenue, but significantly higher engagement as a result of which that's a trade off we're happy to make. Second, as we increase our investment in new categories. And third, as we increase our investment in the international. Because of the early stages of the evolution of these investments, usually they come with a lower take rate, and so you're seeing the blending effect in our take rate as a result of these investments.\nBradley Erickson: That's great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Steven Fox from Fox Advisors LLC. Your line is open, sir.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. Just two questions from the letter. I was curious if you could expand on. You mentioned three points of category share in the quarter, and then you also mentioned gaining more DashPass subscribers. Can you give us a little bit of color around what you're seeing that's driving that? What's behind the numbers basically? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. I think it comes down to a superior product, which is \u2013 the thing we aim to deliver is the best combination of selection, affordability and quality and what those three things translate into is category-leading spend retention. So our category-leading spend retention, I believe that translates some of these market share gains that you're seeing. DashPass is one component of that because DashPass is how we solve the affordability lever and we continue to increase DashPass subscribers who have higher order frequency compared to non-DashPass subscribers and that's then now leading to increasing order frequency over time as well as improve retention which then drives market share growth.\nSteven Fox: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next one, we have Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe, Tony, ask a little bit more about some additional \u2013 the more of the demand you're seeing for newer categories and also just the power of convenience. And so can you just talk about these dynamics of newer category orders? We know they're growing faster, but most of these orders come from restaurant orders to begin with as an add-on. How are you marketing down? How are people being aware that you offer pets goods and alcohol and everything else? So just maybe some insights on strategy and awareness of these new categories would be helpful. Thank you.\nTony Xu: Sure. I would say that we're still pretty early in that process. I mean, if you think about it, the greatest privilege we have is that our consumers eat 20 to 25 times a week. And so in terms of shot on goal or their willingness to come back to the app daily, we have the luxury to have a wide surface area and a large number of opportunities to actually engage with them. And most of what we're trying to do is we're trying to offer a best-in-class solution for them, whether that's shopping across multiple categories or whether that's shopping in within one category. And so for us it's not coming from one type of use case or one type of occasion. We're still in that learning process. I think there is a long ways to go. I think the industry has a long ways to go. I mean even within our core category, I want to remind folks that of restaurants, we are single-digit percentages of the restaurant industry. And when you add in some of these other categories, we\u2019re at a much, much smaller fraction. And so I think there's a long ways to go before we can start truly inventing technologies that will continue to change consumer preferences. The one thing that we do know is that consumers always lean towards the direction of greater and greater convenience and so that you should expect from future products to come.\nPrabir Adarkar: Tony, I\u2019d add to that [indiscernible]. Tony, just to remind you, in Q1, we had said that less than 10% of our MAUs actually use other categories. So Tony's point about the surface area and short-term goal, there's a lot of opportunity just to increase awareness and drive conversion just within our existing MAUs itself without having to actually acquire customers\u2019 specific to these new categories. Does that make sense?\nRonald Josey: That does. Thank you. That's super helpful. And maybe you talked in a letter as well, just along this there is a complexity across these categories and you are up for the challenge. But maybe help us understand what are the complexities? And that's all I got. Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. I think I know what you're \u2013 Ron, I know what you're referring to is really meant to be, let\u2019s say a rallying cry into our team and we\u2019ve enjoyed and benefited from tailwinds these past 18 months, we cannot let those make us complacent. So the environment is competitive and each change is going to be hard part. And so we need to stay vigilant and laser focused on building the best products for our merchants, casualty and consumers.\nRonald Josey: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So two quick one from us. First, your sales and marketing was up nicely in 2Q. Can you give some color on where these incremental spend was going? Is this related to new category efforts as we thought those were primarily driven through auto discounts? And then on the \u2013 the second question on the non-food categories, there\u2019s a number of different models that we have seen out there between marketplace, drive, warehouses and even more hands-on model using in-store shoppers. With all the new partnerships you\u2019ve announced, can you talk about what\u2019s your preferred strategy to attack these categories? Thanks a lot.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll take the first one, Deepak, on your sales and marketing question, and Tony can take your second. On the first \u2013 the first question, the short answer is the uptick in sales and marketing from a q-on-q perspective was driven primarily by our Dasher acquisition costs. Remember we spoke last at Q1, we were talking about being under supplied and so we made significant investments in acquiring Dashers in fact, acquire more Dashers this quarter than we have ever in the history of DoorDash. And we also experienced high advertising rates slightly because the rideshare industry and others were competing for the Dashers in our pool. So those two things led to higher Dasher costs this quarter that we had planned for if you think about our guidance. Now as for the future, remember, I will say I expect those elevated advertising rates to come down maybe not over the balance of this year would be somewhat conservative. But in the long-term, simply because it's a different pool of people, we\u2019ve discussed this in the past, the different pool of people that act as Dashers versus those that are interested in rideshare. Over 75% of our Dashers are students or have other sort of part-time or full-time job. I think, I mentioned to you over 90% do less than 10 active hours per week. And then the nature of the job is fundamentally different because you don't need a car or have to have a car frankly and order a Dash. And so given the size of this TAM opportunity for Dashers, we do believe those advertising rates will normalize over the long-term.\nTony Xu: Yes. With respect to your second question, what I would say is that, at the end of the day, we take a look at this from that consumer\u2019s perspective of what's going to offer the best product experience in terms of selection, quality and price. And we do that in concert and partnership with all of our retail partners because much of this actually requires invention. And if you think about fundamentally what we're trying to do regardless of the model in which we operate, we're trying to take the physical world or physical businesses and all of the activities that they're doing and being able to give those merchant partners a digital way or frankly, a new way to build their own digital businesses. So every activity has to be re-imagined and there isn't one point solution, I would say, that's going to ultimately work for every single merchant nor is there one that's going to ultimately be consistent enough to actually solve all of the unique challenges within each respective category. We both aspire to build the best-in-class category-specific solution as well as the best-in-class experience across categories. And so we will continuously work with our merchant partners to invent these technologies that will continuously help change consumer preferences.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Tan from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSpencer Tan: Hey. Thank you. Just have two questions. So around the commission caps that could be potentially permanent in New York City and San Francisco. I guess, if you could provide us just an update on where those stand today and how you kind of view the overall impact to your business? And then secondly, in kind of Grubhub and Just Eat Takeaway strongholds like in New York City or Chicago, how are you seeing the competitive environment in Q2 and kind of maybe quarter-to-date? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yes. I'll start with the first question. I'll let Prabir take the second question. With respect to these commission caps, we're actually largely seeing city officials and allow capitalism to take its course as most of these commission caps are actually being lifted, especially as more and more of the country is reopening and getting back into the sense of normalcy. I think with respect to the limited situations in San Francisco and New York City, our point of view is that any approach or ordinance towards a permanent cap is, frankly a) unnecessary because if you actually read some of these commission caps platforms like DoorDash\u2019s, already offer plans well below the commission cap that is proposed. Second, they're very harmful in the sense that they're hurting the audience that they're trying to help, which are these restaurants because commission caps what they do is, they will ultimately result in increased prices for consumers, lowered sales for these restaurants and reduced work opportunities for Dashers. And finally, because of the arbitrary nature of these commission caps, they're violently unconstitutional. I think, the best, I guess, synthesis of the situation might actually come from Mayor London Breed from San Francisco who believe that this ordinance really unnecessarily outweighs any public good. And so that's our take and that's why you see us take litigation action in San Francisco.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Spencer on your question, I mean, really the two markets you mentioned, Chicago and New York City were I guess competitive strongholds for one of our competitors. We are number one in Chicago. We've gained share not just in the second quarter, but also in the first quarter of this year. In New York City, we are not number one, but it\u2019s a clear priority for us. To be clear, we have continued to gain share including in the second quarter. Most of the other competitive share shifts we\u2019ve seen have occurred between the other two peers in that market.\nSpencer Tan: Got it. Thank you both, and congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nAndy Hargreaves: Grace, it looks like we don't have any more questions in the queue. So if that\u2019s the case, can you pass it to Tony for quick closing remark and wrap it up.\nTony Xu: Great. Thanks, Andy. Was there another question, Grace?\nOperator: No. You may proceed presenter.\nTony Xu: Great. Thanks, everyone. I just wanted to take a moment and celebrate the fact that we fulfilled our 2 billionth order in the second quarter. And as someone who has seen this journey from the very beginning, I can tell you that it took us over seven years to achieve our first billionth order, and only nine months later, we\u2019re able to see our second billionth order. So just want to take a moment to reflect on that milestone and thank all of our audiences, the team at DoorDash and all of our shareholders and what is a great achievement. Thank you very much, and we'll see you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Remember we spoke last at Q1, we were talking about being under supplied and so we made significant investments in acquiring Dashers in fact, acquire more Dashers this quarter than we have ever in the history of DoorDash. And we also experienced high advertising rates slightly because the rideshare industry and others were competing for the Dashers in our pool. So those two things led to higher Dasher costs this quarter that we had planned for if you think about our guidance. Now as for the future, remember, I will say I expect those elevated advertising rates to come down maybe not over the balance of this year would be somewhat conservative. But in the long-term, simply because it's a different pool of people, we've discussed this in the past, the different pool of people that act as Dashers versus those that are interested in rideshare. Over 75% of our Dashers are students or have other sort of part-time or full-time job. I think, I mentioned to you over 90% do less than 10 active hours per week. And then the nature of the job is fundamentally different because you don't need a car or have to have a car frankly and order a Dash. And so given the size of this TAM opportunity for Dashers, we do believe those advertising rates will normalize over the long-term. And Spencer on your question, I mean, really the two markets you mentioned, Chicago and New York City were I guess competitive strongholds for one of our competitors. We are number one in Chicago. We've gained share not just in the second quarter, but also in the first quarter of this year. In New York City, we are not number one, but it's a clear priority for us. To be clear, we have continued to gain share including in the second quarter. Most of the other competitive share shifts we've seen have occurred between the other two peers in that market."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Great. Hey Ross. I'll take the first question and I'll let Prabir start the second. So, on the first question with respect to new categories, I mean, you're right. We're super excited about our progress. In Q1, we announced that, about 70% of our business was coming from orders outside of restaurants, and that has grown sequentially and it's grown certainly faster than our restaurants business. And it does touch upon the strategy of creating both in marketplace where we're generating incremental demand and really building best-in-class point solutions category-by-category or bringing everything inside the neighborhood to consumers in minutes, not hours or days. And then on the other side, we are also building a first-party capability on behalf of retailers and merchants, so that they can create their own digital businesses. The goal of DoorDash has always been to create the largest local commerce marketplace as well as the largest local commerce platform. And we think that this strategy is certainly playing out, not just in our core and original category of restaurants, but now also heading into other categories. Sure. I would say that we're still pretty early in that process. I mean, if you think about it, the greatest privilege we have is that our consumers eat 20 to 25 times a week. And so in terms of shot on goal or their willingness to come back to the app daily, we have the luxury to have a wide surface area and a large number of opportunities to actually engage with them. And most of what we're trying to do is we're trying to offer a best-in-class solution for them, whether that's shopping across multiple categories or whether that's shopping in within one category. And so for us it's not coming from one type of use case or one type of occasion. We're still in that learning process. I think there is a long ways to go. I think the industry has a long ways to go. I mean even within our core category, I want to remind folks that of restaurants, we are single-digit percentages of the restaurant industry. And when you add in some of these other categories, we're at a much, much smaller fraction. And so I think there's a long ways to go before we can start truly inventing technologies that will continue to change consumer preferences. The one thing that we do know is that consumers always lean towards the direction of greater and greater convenience and so that you should expect from future products to come. Yes. With respect to your second question, what I would say is that, at the end of the day, we take a look at this from that consumer's perspective of what's going to offer the best product experience in terms of selection, quality and price. And we do that in concert and partnership with all of our retail partners because much of this actually requires invention. And if you think about fundamentally what we're trying to do regardless of the model in which we operate, we're trying to take the physical world or physical businesses and all of the activities that they're doing and being able to give those merchant partners a digital way or frankly, a new way to build their own digital businesses. So every activity has to be re-imagined and there isn't one point solution, I would say, that's going to ultimately work for every single merchant nor is there one that's going to ultimately be consistent enough to actually solve all of the unique challenges within each respective category. We both aspire to build the best-in-class category-specific solution as well as the best-in-class experience across categories. And so we will continuously work with our merchant partners to invent these technologies that will continuously help change consumer preferences. Yes. I'll start with the first question. I'll let Prabir take the second question. With respect to these commission caps, we're actually largely seeing city officials and allow capitalism to take its course as most of these commission caps are actually being lifted, especially as more and more of the country is reopening and getting back into the sense of normalcy. I think with respect to the limited situations in San Francisco and New York City, our point of view is that any approach or ordinance towards a permanent cap is, frankly a) unnecessary because if you actually read some of these commission caps platforms like DoorDash's, already offer plans well below the commission cap that is proposed. Second, they're very harmful in the sense that they're hurting the audience that they're trying to help, which are these restaurants because commission caps what they do is, they will ultimately result in increased prices for consumers, lowered sales for these restaurants and reduced work opportunities for Dashers. And finally, because of the arbitrary nature of these commission caps, they're violently unconstitutional. I think, the best, I guess, synthesis of the situation might actually come from Mayor London Breed from San Francisco who believe that this ordinance really unnecessarily outweighs any public good. And so that's our take and that's why you see us take litigation action in San Francisco. Great. Thanks, Andy. Was there another question, Grace? Great. Thanks, everyone. I just wanted to take a moment and celebrate the fact that we fulfilled our 2 billionth order in the second quarter. And as someone who has seen this journey from the very beginning, I can tell you that it took us over seven years to achieve our first billionth order, and only nine months later, we're able to see our second billionth order. So just want to take a moment to reflect on that milestone and thank all of our audiences, the team at DoorDash and all of our shareholders and what is a great achievement. Thank you very much, and we'll see you soon."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Andy Hargreaves. Please go ahead.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thanks, Mei. Hello, everyone. And thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. I am pleased to be joined today by Co-founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements during this call, including statements regarding our expectations of our business, future financial results and guidance and strategy. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements and such risks are described in our risk factors including in a SEC filings, including Form 10-K. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial results, including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our investor letter, which is available on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website, and audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. We\u2019re going to go straight into questions today. So, Mei, please take the first question.\nOperator: Our first question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks for taking the question. Two if I can. Just first in the shareholder letter, you called out increased frequency from existing customers who order convenience and I\u2019m curious if you can just put a finer point on that. Is that increases in frequency even on the food delivery side just more habituation to the app or is it more just a comment that convenience is additive and not cannibalistic? And I guess maybe in areas where the product is more full in terms of other things that you offer on the platform on top of food, convenience and other stuff? Are there similar dynamics where just the more categories people use it across, the more they use within individual categories? And then the second question would just be as far as the new commission packages, how are you seeing kind of merchants react to the new packages? Are they opting into the higher value bundles and what should we kind of expect in terms of take rate impact from that? Anything you can share that would be great. Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hi, Lloyd. It\u2019s Prabir. Why don\u2019t I take the first question on the frequency comment and then Tony will take the second. It\u2019s the latter thing you mentioned, which is what we actually find is that these categories are symbiotic with one another. So customers who order from new categories subsequently increase their frequency with restaurants by a greater amount than those who do not order from new categories. To said definitely, once you begin to use multiple categories, that actually increases your engagement with the core restaurant category. And then the other thing we found is that customers will actually engage with us across different categories beyond food, also creating stronger retention and engagement versus restaurants are pleased. Obviously consumers are pleased that all of our restaurant selling it. So we\u2019re actually seeing strength, because the addition of categories basically makes a user stickier without platform.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Lloyd. On the -- this is Tony. On the second question. The business impact is reflected in our guidance and it\u2019s something that we feel pretty comfortable. And as we tested this program, as we do with all of our new initiatives with merchants for about six months. So it\u2019s meeting our expectations in terms of our rollout so far. But I thought I\u2019d take a second to give you a bit of the guiding principles or the design principles behind why we shipped what we announced a couple of weeks ago. If you take a step back, we took quite a lot of actions during the pandemic to make sure that the businesses would be successful, that\u2019s the entirety of why DoorDash was founded to make sure that these local businesses would succeed. And so during the pandemic, I\u2019m very proud that the actions we took, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in investments we made allow these businesses to have 8 times the odds of surviving the pandemic versus the average restaurant in the industry. Now, as we get out of the pandemic and as we start heading into reopening, which I\u2019m very excited about, given where the country is in terms of vaccination rates increasing and such, is that, we wanted to give these business owners and speaking with him for about six months, seven months about this, the best chance of getting out of the gate as fast as possible. And what we heard over and again was, they really wanted choice, choice on the spectrum of investing in growth and in which case, they can pick some of the higher price plans that allows them participation in programs like DashPass, where DoorDash is covering the cost of delivery or choice in the form of greater profitability, depending on how they\u2019re seeing staffing and things like that, as they get into recovery. Choice in the form of whether the orders are coming from the DoorDash app or their own channel, where we\u2019re offering commission free, no cost product called DoorDash Storefront which will allow them to build their own digital channels, as well as choice in the form of non delivery use cases like pickup where we slashed rates from 15% to 6%. And so that really was the reason why we shift to what we announced and we had been working with these merchants for about six months on it. And in terms of the financial impact or the impact on the business, all of that is reflected in our guidance.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yeah. Just to add one point is that, if you actually look at these programs, there is an offset between the lower commission rate that comes with a higher consumer fee, it\u2019s not a perfect offset, but just keep that in mind as you think about the ramifications going.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.\nOperator: Next in line is Douglas Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. As to first just hoping to talk more about your thoughts on impact of reopening, and perhaps, just better thoughts have changed relative to six months ago, if it has? And then second question, just DoorDash supply, I guess, just how do you get comfortable with how that can play out here in the coming months given some of the supply issues, of course, better to deal with ridesharing in some other areas? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hey, Doug. Thanks for the question. So the first thing I\u2019ll say is, we were encouraged by the trends that we saw in the first quarter, particularly as markets reopened and in-store dining grew, the negative impact to consumer behavior was smaller than we initially anticipated and that enabled us to actually beat our Q1 guidance by 9%. What\u2019s driving that is the commentary we made even at the -- at our earlier earnings call we talked about consumer behavior being sticky. So as consumers begin to use the product, new habits develop and those habits tend to persist and par of that\u2019s been bolstered by the fact that the product has gotten routinely better over the course of time. Just over the course of this past year, the selection on the platforms improve in terms of the number of restaurants, as well as new categories, which is convenience stores and grocery stores, quality is improved, our affordability has gotten better. And all these things continue to adapt and support the continued stickiness as far as consumers go. And so as we look to the future, we\u2019re optimistic about the balance of the year, which led to an increase of guidance by about 15% to $35 billion to $38 billion of GOV. On your second question, I know rideshare is focused on this. But it\u2019s important to remember that rideshare drivers are a different pool of people than a Dashers. Over 75% of our Dashers are students or other part time or full time jobs on average they dash less than 4 hours per week. Dashers don\u2019t require a car, they can dash on bikes. Our population of Dashers tend to skew more female and that\u2019s likely because you don\u2019t have to share your personal space with another individual. And so even in our survey data shows that 21% of our Dashers not building for rideshare and only 6% say they prefer rideshare. So the completely different pool of people. We had a little bit of a supply blip in March that will solve the issue. We acted quickly. We took a bunch of actions including improving the efficiency of the logistics network, expanded our marketing funnels, improving our conversion rates for Dashers and the result we\u2019re now acquiring more Dashers per week than we were competitive one. So while supplies today and expect that to be the case for the foreseeable future.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thank you, Prabir.\nOperator: Next is Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much and congrats on the impressive quarter. Just two if I may. First, can you just speak to the recent trends that you\u2019ve seen so far, in May I think your guide speaks to it. But anything to highlight in terms of just the competitive intensity and how you guys feel about the -- particularly the growth in the non-food delivery business in the quarter and contribution to it? And second, as you look at the diversification that you\u2019re embarking on into non-food, convenience, grocery, et cetera. I was wondering if you can just speak to the broader, well, first, how big you think that business could become over time? Is this a situation where you could see a scenario where half of your business is coming from these new initiatives, say, over the next I don\u2019t know three years to five years, but probably, also just how do you see that impacting the take rates over time? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Sure. Hey. It\u2019s Tony. I\u2019ll start. So far the quarter is off to a great start. And what I\u2019ll say is that, the impact of reopening really has been more muted than we expected. Certainly, when we were looking at this last fall and even as we\u2019re starting to prepare for this towards even last summer. With respect to some of the new categories, we\u2019re very excited about our progress. I mean, growing 40% quarter-on-quarter, our non-restaurant orders now totaling over 7% of our total orders. And again, this happened in a pretty short period of time. We really in earnest launched our second category outside of restaurants in convenience, which we\u2019re now the market leader in just under a year. So things are certainly ahead of plan and exceeding our expectations there. With respect to I think the broader question of how this plays out and unfolds, as to remind all of us on the call, as I mentioned, during our -- actually our very first earnings call, we\u2019re really investing in four areas. We\u2019re investing, certainly, to grow our core business and we\u2019re seeing greater strength there, especially as we saw record engagement in the quarter, as well as our investment into other use cases, such as, pick up, where we\u2019re also the market leader now or the office business, like DoorDash for Work. We are investing certainly into new categories. We\u2019re also investing into the build out of our platform so DoorDash is as much a marketplace or app that grows your orders, as well as a platform that gives you products like DoorDash Drive, DoorDash Storefront to help merchants build their own channels, and then finally, international market growth. And so those are the four buckets of where we\u2019re investing. And we\u2019re very, very excited by both how things are progressing in all these areas, as well as what that might mean for diversification in the future.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Youssef, if I could just add to that, I mean, some of the markets you mentioned, whether it\u2019s convenience or grocery, these are extremely large markets, convenience is $200 billion and $250 billion, grocery is an $800 billion -- trillion market. But the thing that\u2019s unique is both of these have very low penetration rates and you think about our platform and the success that we\u2019re enjoying in convenience up to this point, despite thank you launching that business 12 months ago, it\u2019s because of the extensibility of our platform. Because we can take a hybrid approach that pairs together, not just third-party partners in our marketplace like CVS, like Walgreens, like 7-Eleven, in fact, Rite Aid that we recently announced. But also we\u2019re bringing our own first-party selection to consumers and that\u2019s in order to provide consumers a choice and serve them in underserved neighborhoods. And so penetration extremely low today and there\u2019s a lot of runway for growth.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up on our last one and then one other one. So the 7% of orders for non-restaurant, can you talk about the unit economics of that business and your got-to-market like Instacart I think is mostly getting its profit pool from ads. Gopuff is a one key business. So how do we think about the blended offering that you guys have an EBITDA per order, I think you mentioned is a little bit lower for convenience, any color there would be helpful on the EBITDA per order. And then it sounds like based on the letter that you guys are expecting a little bit of a drop off into the summer, which I think everybody can totally understand as things reopen, the question is more like, as you look at the data and are you seeing new customers that came in in 2020 and those ones that are going to drop off or is it that the higher frequency Dash past folks who order like 5 times a month. I\u2019m just going order last, when we get to the summer. Any color on that would be helpful? Thanks guys.\nPrabir Adarkar: So on the first question in terms of the unit economics, we\u2019re not actually breaking out even economics with these orders. What I will say is where we\u2019re fortunate in that our core U.S. business is cash generative and we\u2019re taking that cash and we\u2019re investing it to grow some of the new verticals with its community to or expand into new merchant services like storefront as well as expanding. So we\u2019re fortunate to have a profitable core business that allows us to invest in variance. On the question regarding the summer seasonality in the trajectory reticles baked into the guidance is the fact that starting about April and going all the way through to later day usually as the weather improves, we see consumers go dining and that behavior is generally consistent across both new customers that we recently acquired as well as existing customers that have been in the black for a while. It could be just behavior that we tend to see as weather improves and people want to go out a little bit more. So you don\u2019t see it in our historical numbers partly because of the rapid pace of customer acquisition. But if you look at it on a cohort level it\u2019s there both for you and existing cohorts.\nOperator: Next is Ralph Schackart from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nRalph Schackart: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m just curious if you could provide maybe a little more color on Dash pay and incentive trends that you\u2019ve seen both in the quarter, maybe kind of quarter-to-date, and on the low talked about 40% pay increase 30% I think decrease for cost of consumers over two year period. It sounds like you\u2019re in better supply situation now which is great. Just curious if you could give some more color on kind of recent trends and then signups are some of that\u2019s getting passed on the consumer and then eventually as government incentive programs subside. Do you think the driver incentives will normalize over time? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes, maybe I\u2019ll take that question. The summary is we\u2019re expecting take rates to improve sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and in part that\u2019s driven by the fact that Dash should be -- will normalize because the supply state is actually better to be the problem has been resolved and will drive market back to health. Taking a step back just in terms of overall Dash should be -- we\u2019ve said before, in the context of overall strategy, our North Staris to reduce customer prices, consumer prices, reduce the fees and commissions and just merchants and increased earnings per Dash and so in the 40% year over to will increase in Dash earnings per active hour, is consistent with our general philosophy. So as we continue to squeeze out more efficiency out of the logistics network, as we continue to improve by be fact and that results in unit economic improvements we invest a lot of that back into the ecosystem by taking down fees and by increasing Dash owners.\nRalph Schackart: Great. And if I could squeeze one more. And just under pickup opportunity, you talked about on the call and the later it seems a pretty good opportunity for you post-COVID environment. Maybe just talk about sort of how that\u2019s been received by consumers can of what we\u2019ve learned and as you had sort of technology to that long-term some innovation. What are your views on this opportunity? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Sure, I\u2019ll take that, it\u2019s Tony. I think the greatest privilege we probably have in this business is that people eats 22 to 25 times a week, maybe more, maybe less during this pandemic, but what I will say is that when someone is doing that kind of frequency of consumption, it\u2019s never going to happen in one method, it\u2019s never going to be all in cooking, it\u2019s never going to be all in eating out or eating in or getting deliveries. I think especially as we get out of the pandemic, we\u2019re going to go back to doing some of the things that I think are now priced commodities by grabbing a coffee on the way to work or doing a walk along the block with your colleagues and grabbing a snack or what have you and so we\u2019re seeing quite a lot of excitement to the pick a products, I think not just because people are tired of being stuck at home. But I think there is just a mere fact because we consume so often that this is one of the natural use cases that governs our behavior and so we\u2019re very excited to continue investing there.\nRalph Schackart: Great, Tony and thanks Prabir.\nOperator: Next is Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great, thanks for taking the question guys. One for Tony and one follow-up for Prabir. Can you talk about your partnership strategy for the new categories? I mean you\u2019ve entered into partnership is a lot of retailers directly, but as you kind of think about expanding it further over the next few years. How should we think about your desire to work with platforms that have offline business integrations like the online presence systems, point of sale software companies, shop with [inaudible] and even companies like Facebook to scale the merchant\u2019s side rapidly on both marketplace and drive?\nTony Xu: Yes, I\u2019ll start. Hi, Deepak, it\u2019s Tony. So the way that we look at all things is how do we build the best products and before our marketplace with that really means is how do we offer the best selection, quality price and customer service and for our platform business where we\u2019re building tools for merchants to allow them to grow their own digital businesses. It\u2019s really about how do we allow them to be very successful across all the activities that they have to perform in order to build a digital business. And so with that, I suppose as the guiding principle, we would consider any partnerships that achieve those means and they can look different depending on whether or not they fit into our marketplace or whether or not they fit into our platform, and so at DoorDash, we really are thinking about building the system that has both components. One, the system is our app which is trying to grow all of local commerce and bring everything inside your neighborhoods and minutes not hours or days. And then on the other side, we are trying to empower you the merchants to replicate and grow on top of your four-wall business and the two job that we do which is grow in power local commerce for all years.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. Now that\u2019s very helpful Tony, and then Prabir, can you talk about the second half guidance on GOV. Should we expect that GOV to bottom out in 3Q and it start improving sequentially in 4Q into 2022. How are you thinking about like the slope in the second half? Thank you so much.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes, the second half GOV has impacted by two factors. The first we\u2019re baking in some uncertainty with respect to consumer behavior as markets continue to reopen it is increase vaccination rates, but second to your point, there is some seasonality, even in that region continues to Labor Day until you\u2019ve got notes of Q2 and Q3 [inaudible]. And then as the winter season start setting in and we start to see growth from there right now. So it\u2019s this what you pointed out. The one thing I will say Deepak is just stepping back the GOV guidance for the year is materially higher than what we thought at the beginning of the year. So I\u2019d point to the shape of the curve you see at the novel right but may anything that you cited a big picture, which is we were feeling more optimistic today than you were earlier on.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Next is Michael McGovern from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael McGovern: Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter. I just wanted to ask maybe about -- maybe just like a regulatory overview. It seems like there\u2019s been a lot of news items on the regulatory side recently. So, maybe first if you could comment about the federal side and the comments from the Department of Labor Secretary recently and just any views on what could happen in long-term on the federal side? And then I think some of your peers in the gig economy rideshare space have talked about potentially working out deals with states that might look similar to Prop 22. So can you share with us if you\u2019re participating in those kinds of discussions are just what you think about the potential for regulatory developments on the state side as well? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yes, hey, Mike, it\u2019s Tony. I\u2019ll take that. So we\u2019re very excited about what we heard Secretary Walsh and the buying administration say which two or years was that they\u2019re very excited and figuring out with us with the private sector companies how to actually construct a model that takes us into the 21st century instead of I guess moving backwards the 20th century. I mean if you think about it. What DoorDash stands for is optimizing for the worker. So in this case the Dasher, the millions two drivers on our platform. And the number one thing we hear over and again from Dashers is that they want this flexibility that has never existed in any labor environment before, and the question is how do we marry that\u2019s in the face of traditional labor definitions with benefits and protections that we believe they deserve and what we heard from really anyone we stick to is our willingness to engage in that conversation and construct forward a third way in which we can compare this independence and flexibility with benefits and that\u2019s true at the federal level, that true at the state level, and any elected official that we speak with.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Mike, this to be clear, the deal we clear that we aren\u2019t taking immediate action and said we want to give comes from we\u2019re in dialog, which with the government in state level.\nMichael McGovern: Got it. Maybe just one quick follow-up to that. I thought the prior comments about the difference between Dashers and rideshare drivers were really important, especially on the regulatory side. So could you talk about just like the possibility that rideshare drivers and food delivery couriers are regulated separately with different rules or do you think that gig economy workers could just all be kind of lumped together long-term in terms of like that regulatory response in development?\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes, I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019ve got a full confusion on this matter. I mean, as Tony indicated in the Secretary Walsh\u2019s comment actually suggest an openness to engage with the private sector to figure this stuff out, so it\u2019s a little early to signal whether rideshare drivers we could together with the broader gig economy or good support, we\u2019ll come back if there\u2019s any update on this topic as our conversations progressed.\nMichael McGovern: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next is Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is Shawn [ph] on the call for Jason. So just one on how are you guys thinking about the risk around local pricing cash and how does this take into account with the new merchant pricing model? And then second, can you talk about the competitive environment around non-food sales relative to the environment through deliveries is more competitive, good at the same, less competitive. What are you guys doing there? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yes. Hi, Shawn, it\u2019s Tony. I\u2019ll start. So on the first question around commission caps what we expect is that these commission caps will be rolling off pretty soon in fact we\u2019ve already seen some of this and some very large cities like in Chicago, Kansas City, Cincinnati, I saw some even roll off earlier this week and so we\u2019re very encouraged I think by what we\u2019re seeing which is elected officials allowing capitalism to do its job and allow everyone to really make things work for all audiences and we\u2019re the first to be excited at DoorDash to have, lots of folk go back inside restaurants, and I think people will and I think that\u2019s -- as that continues to happen as the reopenings occur more and more folks will see delivery as an augmented way to help grow these physical businesses and to be one part of the portfolio of how they do business moving forward. I think with respect to the second question which is around I think you asked about the competitive environment and some of these newer categories. I mean, look, I would say that certainly things exceeded our expectations. If you look at the fact that we started just a year ago in our first non-restaurant category convenience and in about a year\u2019s time, we\u2019ve become the market leader in that category. I think really just show the strengths of both actually across all audiences. The receptivity to our platform how Dashers willing to do deliveries across different hours of the day, different categories how consumers are willing to see help solve different jobs at different times of the week and how different types of merchants will like to have access to the largest on demand food audience and that comes to us at the highest frequencies every month. And so far we are seeing quite a lot of progress in these areas. But to Prabir earlier points to an earlier question, we had the beginning of a massive transformation that\u2019s just unfolding. I mean just to remind all of us even in the core restaurant business even if you added all of the sales up for the largest platforms in the U.S. or about 10% or less of the entire restaurant industry. If you did the same math for some of these other categories that we\u2019re entering via convenience grocery and others that number is very, very, very small single-digits. And so there is a massive runway ahead.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nRon Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question and really great quarter. I wanted to ask two please more on -- one on DashPass, and you talked about subscribers more than doubled year-over-year average order frequency is an all-time high and I think you mentioned that new users joining in 1Q was somewhat of a record, but can you talk about the strategic nature of DashPass here just specifically as you think about increasing the penetration of new categories and you are increasing the MAUs for new categories, just how you see both DashPass in new categories are working together. And then, Tony maybe as a follow-up to your prior answer, and this is weird question maybe, but could it be that with the reopening the amount of change in consumer behavior to the reopening might actually help longer term about how we as consumers this order things restaurant food et cetera online and how you\u2019re thinking about how the reopening might actually be a tailwind? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Ron, Prabir will take the first one, and Tony will take the second. DashPass at the end of the day in the core pillar of our strategy to think about what we\u2019re going to do for consumers, its ability to deliver the wider selection. The best quality and superior affordability and DashPass right to the heart of both selection as well as this price because DashPass as you know consumers digital delivery fees introduced services on their orders until refining is consumers particularly the start increasing the engagement we derive value out of the fact that the $10 subscription fee differs the cost of multiple industries and multiple deliveries and multiple orders and so we are seeing the value proposition of a DashPass translating to into sign ups that have been allowed us to grow the DashPass number should be could be 2x was a year ago and another aspect of the strategy is to continue adding verticals into DashPass. So much the same way Amazon Prime allows you to consume products across multiple categories. That\u2019s our vision for DashPass with Starwood Food and over time, we\u2019ve added convenience stores and then the time as we continue that categories see get slotted into to DashPass to improve the consumer value proposition.\nTony Xu: Yes, and with respect to the second question around the reopening as a possible tailwind. I guess, no one has the crystal ball in terms of how this shape recovery occurs, I think in the earlier discussion how the slope of change happens, but what I would say is that the long-term trend is that when it comes to convenience things always move towards the direction of greater to convenience, which means that over the long-term and I suppose, if you look at it from that perspective the tailwind thesis would be that the all that\u2019s happening is that we\u2019ve kind of shifted some of the growth that was otherwise going to happen by who knows some period of time and I think what it was. It has allowed is just that it\u2019s allowed more and more people to be more and more comfortable with this type of business, which allows possibly faster entry into other categories as we power all of local commerce for example. And so I think that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re seeing it, but I do just want to remind people that convenience only moves in the direction of better convenience. I mean if someone was wanted to go and eat inside of a restaurant for example, they\u2019re probably not thinking about delivery. Conversely, if they\u2019re thinking about takeout or delivery they probably we\u2019re never going to go inside the restaurant in the first instance. And so I think it\u2019s again. I always like to step back in moments where we\u2019re trying to figure out what seems like a very difficult question to take a slightly longer time horizon and think was the greatest privilege we have here is that people eat 22 to 25 times a week and do we see some share of that growing into more convenience. We believe the answer is yes.\nRon Josey: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: We have our next question from Spencer Tan [ph] from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just, I think one question around guidance. So it looks like if you were to take the midpoint of your GOV and EBITDA guidance that you\u2019re guiding to EBITDA accretion versus prior quarters. Just wondering if that\u2019s a direct from the commission structure change that you announced this quarter and how we should think about that. Maybe just providing a little bit more color around that specifically. And then secondarily, I guess, looking into the recovery. Are you seeing any restaurants consolidate the platforms that they utilize and do you think that DoorDash has a competitive advantage from that standpoint by offering other types of software as a service and storefront versus maybe some of the smaller competitors out there i.e., having the ability to maybe gain a little bit more share from some of your comps? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: So if I answer the question correctly that to do with the EBITDA margins of the [inaudible] GOV picking up slightly, is there\u2026\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, got you.\nPrabir Adarkar: What I\u2019d say is would be provided a range of EBITDA, but if you just reiterate the way we manage our business, it\u2019s to try to maximize scale and so to the extent that the opportunity available to invest in order to beat top line we will do that all day long. The reason for expanding the guidance compared to the prior quarter. We don\u2019t want to feel compelled to have to spend the money in the quarter. If we don\u2019t find the right term cash flows. And so what this allows us to do is to drive that profitability to the bottom line in the event that the right investment opportunities and the slight margin accretion that you see is because of the sequential increase in the peak rate that we\u2019re expecting in Q2 because supply side is normal.\nTony Xu: Got it. Okay. Yes, thanks. And at this time, with respect to the second question, yes, we do believe that by having a wider portfolio of products, we can certainly serve more use cases both from a consumer perspective, as I was mentioning earlier people 22 to 25 times a week and so by having more use cases, whether it\u2019d be in delivery pick up the office business where we\u2019re serving a bigger addressable market and of course, you are stemming from that regard. And then with respect to the merchants on the platform piece where we\u2019re not only their largest source of incremental demand through our app. But the fact that we also power their own channels powered their deliveries that gives us greater ordered entity, which drives lower fulfillment costs, but it also allows us to take up greater kitchen capacity as we\u2019re powering the majority of the space that is being used up to produce the food in the first instance and so. I think those are some ways in which our suite of products are generating competitive advantage both for the consumer in terms of just giving a lot more value beyond delivery as well as some of the things that said earlier where we\u2019re adding more categories at no extra charge into a program like DashPass. And then on the merchant side, the wide portfolio of products choose either to grow through the largest source of incremental demand or app or the fact that we\u2019re powering we all of their channels allows us to certainly work with merchants more, but also take more of their production capacity.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you so much and congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Clara Linton [ph] from BTIG. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good evening. Tony or Prabir and why does some speculation on M&A that\u2019s come up somewhat recently, I wanted to see if we could revisit, how you guys are thinking about both new market entry and also specifically weighing up sort of build versus buy options for doing that? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yes, look, I mean we\u2019ve said previously that one of our aspiration is to build a global company in Italy. We operate in the U.S., Canada and Australia. And over time over a long horizon, we will go to expand outside of these regions, now as far as M&A goes what I\u2019d say is we look at all of the opportunities around us. And we\u2019re fortunate in that we\u2019ve got the core business in the U.S. that generates cash and we can invest organically to build out doesn\u2019t to the nation. To the extent, M&A makes sense it might be something we consider. But the bar is extremely high, just given that M&A frankly, it is a complicated matter and getting it right is difficult. So unless we\u2019ve got absolute conviction that M&A is right tool, we will usually rely on inorganic mechanisms.\nOperator: No further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mr. Andy Hargreaves.\nAndy Hargreaves: Perfect, thank you for the questions and thank you everybody for joining us today. Have a great afternoon or evening and we\u2019ll talk to you again in a few months. Bye.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect",

As to first just hoping to talk more about your thoughts on impact of reopening, and perhaps, just better thoughts have changed relative to six months ago, if it has?

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Yeah. Hey, Lloyd. On the -- this is Tony. On the second question. The business impact is reflected in our guidance and it's something that we feel pretty comfortable. And as we tested this program, as we do with all of our new initiatives with merchants for about six months. So it's meeting our expectations in terms of our rollout so far. But I thought I'd take a second to give you a bit of the guiding principles or the design principles behind why we shipped what we announced a couple of weeks ago. If you take a step back, we took quite a lot of actions during the pandemic to make sure that the businesses would be successful, that's the entirety of why DoorDash was founded to make sure that these local businesses would succeed. And so during the pandemic, I'm very proud that the actions we took, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in investments we made allow these businesses to have 8 times the odds of surviving the pandemic versus the average restaurant in the industry. Now, as we get out of the pandemic and as we start heading into reopening, which I'm very excited about, given where the country is in terms of vaccination rates increasing and such, is that, we wanted to give these business owners and speaking with him for about six months, seven months about this, the best chance of getting out of the gate as fast as possible. And what we heard over and again was, they really wanted choice, choice on the spectrum of investing in growth and in which case, they can pick some of the higher price plans that allows them participation in programs like DashPass, where DoorDash is covering the cost of delivery or choice in the form of greater profitability, depending on how they're seeing staffing and things like that, as they get into recovery. Choice in the form of whether the orders are coming from the DoorDash app or their own channel, where we're offering commission free, no cost product called DoorDash Storefront which will allow them to build their own digital channels, as well as choice in the form of non delivery use cases like pickup where we slashed rates from 15% to 6%. And so that really was the reason why we shift to what we announced and we had been working with these merchants for about six months on it. And in terms of the financial impact or the impact on the business, all of that is reflected in our guidance. Sure. Hey. It's Tony. I'll start. So far the quarter is off to a great start. And what I'll say is that, the impact of reopening really has been more muted than we expected. Certainly, when we were looking at this last fall and even as we're starting to prepare for this towards even last summer. With respect to some of the new categories, we're very excited about our progress. I mean, growing 40% quarter-on-quarter, our non-restaurant orders now totaling over 7% of our total orders. And again, this happened in a pretty short period of time. We really in earnest launched our second category outside of restaurants in convenience, which we're now the market leader in just under a year. So things are certainly ahead of plan and exceeding our expectations there. With respect to I think the broader question of how this plays out and unfolds, as to remind all of us on the call, as I mentioned, during our -- actually our very first earnings call, we're really investing in four areas. We're investing, certainly, to grow our core business and we're seeing greater strength there, especially as we saw record engagement in the quarter, as well as our investment into other use cases, such as, pick up, where we're also the market leader now or the office business, like DoorDash for Work. We are investing certainly into new categories. We're also investing into the build out of our platform so DoorDash is as much a marketplace or app that grows your orders, as well as a platform that gives you products like DoorDash Drive, DoorDash Storefront to help merchants build their own channels, and then finally, international market growth. And so those are the four buckets of where we're investing. And we're very, very excited by both how things are progressing in all these areas, as well as what that might mean for diversification in the future. Sure, I'll take that, it's Tony. I think the greatest privilege we probably have in this business is that people eats 22 to 25 times a week, maybe more, maybe less during this pandemic, but what I will say is that when someone is doing that kind of frequency of consumption, it's never going to happen in one method, it's never going to be all in cooking, it's never going to be all in eating out or eating in or getting deliveries. I think especially as we get out of the pandemic, we're going to go back to doing some of the things that I think are now priced commodities by grabbing a coffee on the way to work or doing a walk along the block with your colleagues and grabbing a snack or what have you and so we're seeing quite a lot of excitement to the pick a products, I think not just because people are tired of being stuck at home. But I think there is just a mere fact because we consume so often that this is one of the natural use cases that governs our behavior and so we're very excited to continue investing there. Yes, I'll start. Hi, Deepak, it's Tony. So the way that we look at all things is how do we build the best products and before our marketplace with that really means is how do we offer the best selection, quality price and customer service and for our platform business where we're building tools for merchants to allow them to grow their own digital businesses. It's really about how do we allow them to be very successful across all the activities that they have to perform in order to build a digital business. And so with that, I suppose as the guiding principle, we would consider any partnerships that achieve those means and they can look different depending on whether or not they fit into our marketplace or whether or not they fit into our platform, and so at DoorDash, we really are thinking about building the system that has both components. One, the system is our app which is trying to grow all of local commerce and bring everything inside your neighborhoods and minutes not hours or days. And then on the other side, we are trying to empower you the merchants to replicate and grow on top of your four-wall business and the two job that we do which is grow in power local commerce for all years. Yes, hey, Mike, it's Tony. I'll take that. So we're very excited about what we heard Secretary Walsh and the buying administration say which two or years was that they're very excited and figuring out with us with the private sector companies how to actually construct a model that takes us into the 21st century instead of I guess moving backwards the 20th century. I mean if you think about it. What DoorDash stands for is optimizing for the worker. So in this case the Dasher, the millions two drivers on our platform. And the number one thing we hear over and again from Dashers is that they want this flexibility that has never existed in any labor environment before, and the question is how do we marry that's in the face of traditional labor definitions with benefits and protections that we believe they deserve and what we heard from really anyone we stick to is our willingness to engage in that conversation and construct forward a third way in which we can compare this independence and flexibility with benefits and that's true at the federal level, that true at the state level, and any elected official that we speak with. Yes. Hi, Shawn, it's Tony. I'll start. So on the first question around commission caps what we expect is that these commission caps will be rolling off pretty soon in fact we've already seen some of this and some very large cities like in Chicago, Kansas City, Cincinnati, I saw some even roll off earlier this week and so we're very encouraged I think by what we're seeing which is elected officials allowing capitalism to do its job and allow everyone to really make things work for all audiences and we're the first to be excited at DoorDash to have, lots of folk go back inside restaurants, and I think people will and I think that's -- as that continues to happen as the reopenings occur more and more folks will see delivery as an augmented way to help grow these physical businesses and to be one part of the portfolio of how they do business moving forward. I think with respect to the second question which is around I think you asked about the competitive environment and some of these newer categories. I mean, look, I would say that certainly things exceeded our expectations. If you look at the fact that we started just a year ago in our first non-restaurant category convenience and in about a year's time, we've become the market leader in that category. I think really just show the strengths of both actually across all audiences. The receptivity to our platform how Dashers willing to do deliveries across different hours of the day, different categories how consumers are willing to see help solve different jobs at different times of the week and how different types of merchants will like to have access to the largest on demand food audience and that comes to us at the highest frequencies every month. And so far we are seeing quite a lot of progress in these areas. But to Prabir earlier points to an earlier question, we had the beginning of a massive transformation that's just unfolding. I mean just to remind all of us even in the core restaurant business even if you added all of the sales up for the largest platforms in the U.S. or about 10% or less of the entire restaurant industry. If you did the same math for some of these other categories that we're entering via convenience grocery and others that number is very, very, very small single-digits. And so there is a massive runway ahead. Yes, and with respect to the second question around the reopening as a possible tailwind. I guess, no one has the crystal ball in terms of how this shape recovery occurs, I think in the earlier discussion how the slope of change happens, but what I would say is that the long-term trend is that when it comes to convenience things always move towards the direction of greater to convenience, which means that over the long-term and I suppose, if you look at it from that perspective the tailwind thesis would be that the all that's happening is that we've kind of shifted some of the growth that was otherwise going to happen by who knows some period of time and I think what it was.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DoorDash Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Andy Hargreaves, you may begin your conference.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thank you, Emma. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. I'm very pleased today to be joined by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; CFO and incoming President and COO, Prabir Adarkar; and VP of Finance and Strategy and our incoming CFO, Ravi Inukonda. We'll be making forward-looking statements during today's call including our expectations for our business, financial position, operating performance, our market, guidance, strategies, our investment approach and the consumer spending environment. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. Many of these uncertainties are described in our SEC filings, including Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our letter to shareholders, which is available on our IR website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call is being audio webcast on our IR website. An audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. With that, I will pass it to Tony for some brief remarks, and then we'll go into questions. Tony?\nTony Xu: Thanks, Andy. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Typically, we just dive right into Q&A. But for today's call, I wanted to say a few words at the top about Christopher, Prabir and Ravi. I'm sure many of you have seen the news that we're naming Prabir, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Ravi as CFO as Christopher retires from operating roles and day-to-day management. In his seven-plus years here, Christopher, or CP as we call him internally, has helped to shape our business and our culture. He infused an operator mindset across the company and coached an entire generation of our leaders. On a personal level, I will miss him. I've learned so much from him and consider myself lucky to count him as a business partner and friend. Today's news is a chance to celebrate CP's 33 incredible years as an operator and what he has helped us build. It also shows the strength of our systems and the amazing team we have built at DoorDash. Prabir and Ravi have been with us for more than four years and have mastered every aspect of our business. Both are without equal in this space, and I'm excited for what they'll achieve and what we'll continue building together. Over our near 10-year history, DoorDash has been fortunate to have had a remarkably stable and high-quality leadership team. Nonetheless, everyone in our team has a succession plan. We knew that CP wouldn't always be here, and we've been ready for this possibility for some time. And we're always developing our bench of talent as well as our systems and processes so that the right people can step up when ready. We operate in a very complicated and dynamic space, and the understanding of nuance and the ability to translate this intuition into pragmatic judgment takes time. We're lucky that we have two people who've been grooming for a while and a group of operators behind them to continue executing with excellence without skipping a beat. Prabir and Ravi are also excellent stewards of our unique culture. Again, I want to thank CP for everything he's done and congratulate both Prabir and Ravi. I'm super excited for what's ahead because as CP likes to say, we're just getting started. With that, I'll turn it back over to Andy, and let's get started with your questions.\nAndy Hargreaves: Emma, we can go to questions now. Take the first question please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great, thanks for taking the question. So a couple of questions. First, Tony, the guidance paragraph in your press release noted ongoing significant investments reflected in the outlook. Can you update us on what the largest areas of incremental investments planned for 2023 are, which businesses started getting additional capital and are showing promising what growth and scaling potential? And then second one for Prabir. Congrats on the new roles. There's definitely some uncertainties around potential regulation in markets like New York City. I know the proposal is delayed until sort of the end of the month. But how are you thinking about the impact on your business currently? And kind of what have you factored into the preliminary 2023 outlook? Thank you so much.\nTony Xu: Hey Deepak, I'll take a stab at both of those questions. And feel free, others, to chime in. I think your first question was really just around how we were thinking about our capital allocation. To start, I think, it's important to just level set on our philosophy for investing, which has stayed the same ever since we've been a public company and really has been the same since day one in building DoorDash, which is our goal is to maximize long-term profit dollars. And so that both has a scale component to it as well as a unit economics component to it. And to me, both of them are very important and it's most important to get the sequencing right so that we are allocating capital in the most efficient ways. So, when you look at this allocation for whether it's 2023 or in the years to come, a lot of the investment is going towards in building our categories beyond restaurants, both in the United States as well as globally, as well as our operations outside of the U.S. as we're now live in 26 countries. I mean, I think it's been remarkable, the progress that we've seen so far in both the share gains, as well as just the level of product market fit that we've achieved in both of these dimensions. With new categories, we're now the largest platform with the most amount of partners outside of restaurants in North America. We've gained share in the majority of our international markets. And our Vault business overseas in Europe is growing much faster than peers. And so we're seeing a lot of progress there, and we're doubling on that momentum. At the same time, we're very observant about our unit economics. And a lot of that progression is reflected in some of the guidance that we shared for 2023, but also in what we expect to see on a go-forward basis as we continue to improve the efficiency of our operations in addition to the quality of our product level. Anyone else wants to add on the first question?\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. Tony, it's Prabir. Maybe I'll add a little bit, and then Ravi can take the New York City question. Deepak, I mean, Tony alluded to the strategy to continue investing behind building out on new categories as well as international. We put up significant proof points that are quite encouraging in terms of our progress in building scale. So just a couple of data points. Last quarter, we had said our U.S. convenience and grocery business, this was in Q3, had GOV growth of over 80%. That business grew 60% year-on-year in Q4, so it still continues to grow at meaningfully higher growth rates compared to the restaurants. Our third-party U.S. grocery business grew 100% year-on-year, both in Q3 and Q4. And in Wolt, as we alluded to in our shareholder letter, on a constant currency basis has grown 50% year-on-year, which is again significantly faster than its European peers. And so I take this as positive proof points in terms of not just product market fit, but our ability to drive scale on the platform. In addition, we've got proof points of continued improvement in unit economics. So we talked about a third-party convenience business. In fact, earlier in 2022, we said it would get to breakeven on a variable profit basis in 2022. In Q4, we did exactly what we said we were going to do. We got to variable profit breakeven. Our third-party grocery business continues to improve its margins. So to be clear, we have a long way to go. But as we continue to improve the products and the part experience, we believe we will continue to drive outsized growth in all of these areas that we're investing behind and continued margin improvement. Ravi, do you want to take the New York City question?\nRavi Inukonda: Yes. Thanks, Prabir. Thanks, Deepak, for the question. On the New York City impact, we've been thinking about this for a while now. The impact from a cost perspective is included in our EBITDA guidance going forward. We actually have a number of levers from an operational perspective that we can put in place, including passing on any fees to our audiences to ensure that we can meet our profitability expectations.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. Thank you so much for the answers. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions, may be two. The first one on the DashPass member number, another strong quarter period of growth. Can you just talk a little bit about the biggest drivers of that DashPass adoption growth? And any update on spend per member across the DashPassers? And the second one is just sort of look at the 2023 guidance. Can you just sort of give us a little \u2013 any breakdown at all how we think about the GOV and the EBITDA from the core U.S. restaurant business as opposed to all the emerging faster-growing businesses in the two pieces?\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. Maybe I'll start on the DashPass question, Brian, and Ravi can chime in on the 2023 guidance question in terms of what's driving the growth there. Really, look, the DashPass growth has been remarkably consistent over the course of this past year. We exited 2021 with 10 million subscribers. We're exiting this year with 15 million. And that \u2013 the pace of that growth has been consistent despite a variety of competitor offerings from both of our competitors in the space. And what that goes to is just evidence, to me at least, that the combination of selection, price and quality that we offer through our program is resonating with customers. In terms of what's driving the growth, it's not been partnership-driven as some of our competitors might be. That's a competitive strategy that others are using. The majority of our growth, at least as far as the DashPass program goes, is from our own channels as well as through traditional performance marketing channels. So these are \u2013 it's not partnership-driven. These are organic channels that ultimately drive that we've seen in the product. Second, the pace continues pretty consistently, and so there's a lot of room to grow. If you think about the size of the DashPass program at 15 million subs, it's still a far cry from other programs, whether it's the number of Netflix members or Prime subscribers, there's a lot of room for us to continue growing. And we're happy with the pace of growth historically, and we're not seeing any signs of that slowing down.\nRavi Inukonda: Thanks, Prabir. Let me take the question on the guide. We are not breaking out any specifics, but our U.S. restaurant business is the largest business, and it's going to be the major driver both on the top line as well as the bottom line. As we talked about in the shareholder letter, we do expect to increase margins, both from our U.S. restaurants as well as all of our investment areas going into 2023.\nBrian Nowak: Great, thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe if I could focus on Wolt. Can you talk a little bit in terms of multipart on elements of the subscription base of Wolt? And what is an opportunity set there as well as some of the competitive dynamic and how you've stated in investment mode in Walt? And what's that meant for a mixture of growth and possibly taking market share in some of those key markets for Wolt?\nTony Xu: Hey Eric, it's Tony. I'll get started, and others can chime in. I think the thesis for Wolt has remained remarkably consistent. When we met the team two years ago, we were first struck by how similar we were as operators and how we thought about just building businesses. But at the same time, what we were really impressed by from a business perspective was just the superior level of retention and order frequency it had achieved with its product relative to peers. And I think that remains to be what we've seen today in the data as we've now been partners for a couple of years now, where you just see the constant progression of its outperformance on a relative basis. And it's just coming from those cohorts getting larger that retain at higher levels who order and engage more often. That, effectively, the geometric sequence of growth that is what you're seeing on a relative basis. It actually isn't that much yet attributed to its subscription products or anything else, which actually lends to its future potential. I mean there's a couple of things that we're pretty excited about. One is just how under-penetrated it is in most of its geographies. And even its most mature established markets, Wolt actually serves a fraction of the actual population. And second, to the premise of the question, there are quite a lot of products that Wolt hasn't yet introduced. And in most of these markets, I think there also doesn't really exist that much e-commerce in terms of its behavior relative to some of what you see here in the United States, and so I think there's a lot of opportunity across a variety of vectors for growth.\nPrabir Adarkar: And just on the competitive dynamic question. I mean you asked the question on market share. Your third-party data, particularly in some of the countries where Wolt operates, isn't clean. But if you just simply look at their constant currency growth rate of 50% and you compare it to the European peers or European divisions of more global peers, the Wolt business is growing significantly faster. So to me, that suggests market share gains despite the fact that we don\u2019t have precise third-party data to back that up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is now open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Kind of try to bundle a few into one. You\u2019ve historically talked about your guidance philosophy being you give a range, you\u2019re not really targeting like beat the high end or hit the high end. It\u2019s more a function of, are there things to invest in that look compelling. And if you find things to invest, right, you don\u2019t end up hitting the high end. Is that still the way that you guys think about guidance philosophy? And how do we think about the growth opportunities you see perhaps into 2023 versus prior years, especially as you kind of get more comfortable with Wolt in a few markets? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hey Lloyd, I mean on the question of guidance philosophy, the way we guide and the way we run the business, I mean none of that\u2019s changed, right? And we\u2019ve said historically, the way we run the business is try to maximize scale and put as much on the top line as possible. The \u2013 and we\u2019re investing in that regard in order to maximize scale. Now as far as the EBITDA guidance goes, the guidance range is really meant to create a sense of discipline so that we ensure we can try to follow within the range. Now precisely where we fall, it depends on the exact investment opportunities available and their returns versus our expectations. And so to the extent, as you pointed out, investments are available, and we like the returns to our payback thresholds, we will invest. In recent times, what we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve outperformed on the top line, whether there\u2019s been strength in consumer metrics, you\u2019ve seen our MAU metrics, you\u2019ve seen our DashPass numbers that has contributed to incremental top line, that has helped us get closer to the top end of the EBITDA range despite a healthy level of investment. So that\u2019s just to clarify where we\u2019ve landed in the range, but the objective, A, philosophy has not changed in terms of how we manage the business and invest for growth. And then B, our objective is not to try to beat the EBITDA range to retire land within it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael McGovern: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the question. I recall back earlier in 2022, you gave a number that you had 80,000 net new restaurants and merchants I think in Q2. And I was curious, how that\u2019s tracking at this point as we get into more potentially recessionary environment? And do you have kind of an underlying assumption for how that will track in 2023? I guess how important is it to continue to drive new restaurant and merchant sign-ups? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yes. Hey Michael, so we\u2019ve continued to see growth in the selection on the platform, and that\u2019s true both for restaurants, and that\u2019s also true for non-restaurants. Actually, I\u2019d say there\u2019s kind of a confluence of two external factors in addition to just, I think the team\u2019s great execution, which is, one, you just see more and more physical retailers digitizing their entire business, which both is a tailwind to our marketplace of joining the marketplace for the first time. I mean if you looked at some of the brands that we onboarded in 2022, a lot of that even diversified beyond restaurants into the grocery sector with additions like Sprouts or Raley's. We announced all these earlier this year. Then you have additions in the retail category, whether it be Sephora or DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods. So a lot of these retailers are digitizing more of their business and coming online to get that incremental business from the largest local commerce marketplace. The second kind of thing that\u2019s happening is the fact that because they\u2019re trying to digitize their entire operations at these retailers, they are also partnering with our platform products as well, products like DoorDash Drive, DoorDash Storefronts, where they\u2019re trying to run more of their business in a fashion that both I think takes advantage of the convenience economy, but also I think, just creates a better business model for themselves, right, where they can make more productive use of their square footage by adding more and more sales into a fixed space. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing the quite a lot of additions, non-stop, candidly, both on the restaurant side as well as on the non-restaurant front.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Mike, just one technical point is that one of the five restaurants goes out of business each year, right? So there\u2019s \u2013 this is a moving target. There\u2019s constantly new restaurants that are appearing that we need to make sure we\u2019re staying ahead of. And so the sales team is always busy, and they\u2019re always putting up bigger and bigger targets in order to make sure that the selection that\u2019s available on our platform is fresh.\nMichael McGovern: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nNikhil Devnani: Hey, there. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple, please. So in the S-1, you provided some really helpful disclosure around contribution margins expanding for mature cohorts. Since then, there\u2019s been some changes: labor, regulatory. But also kind of you scaled up more, you have more subscribers today. Just wondering if that 8% threshold that those cohorts got to, is that still the right way to think about kind of mature cohort profitability for the business today? And then I had a separate question on new verticals. Are they acting as a new customer acquisition channel? Or is it more a function of engaging the existing customer base? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Nikhil, maybe I\u2019ll take the first one. The cohort level margins, they\u2019re healthy and they\u2019re progressing well. We showed you last quarter the total contribution profit for the U.S. restaurant business, which is essentially the aggregated performance of all the cohorts. And so if you take a step back, the contribution profit of our core business has consistently improved over the past few years, despite post-COVID reopening, despite Prop 22, which is a regulatory shop the system inflation and other things, and this is really the output of this focus on improving the efficiency of our logistics network, improving our defect rates and so on. And so we could \u2013 the purpose of that disclosure was to try to provide a simplified view of the progression that we have seen to the cohort margins but on an aggregated basis and to give you a sense of the incremental margins we are seeing in the U.S. restaurant business that are in line with what we\u2019ve said historically. And can you remind me of the second question, please?\nNikhil Devnani: Yes, sure. Just on the new verticals, are they acting as a channel for new customer acquisition altogether? Or is it more about engaging the customers you already have?\nPrabir Adarkar: I got it. Yes, yes. So it\u2019s two things. So it\u2019s strategically important for two purposes. First, we see a growing number of new customers starting with non-restaurant categories. So yes, it is a source of customer acquisition because there might be customers out there that didn\u2019t find the restaurant they were looking for. And now they find DoorDash interesting because their favorite grocery store, their favorite convenience store is on the platform. So yes, a growing number of new customers start their journey with DoorDash with the new \u2013 with the non-restaurant categories. Second, at least \u2013 and this is based on early signals, the work we\u2019ve done at least so far, preliminary seems to suggest that customers who order from both restaurants and non-restaurant categories have an increase in their order rate, which is the product of retention and order frequency compared to those that are single categories. So both of these things are important reasons for us to continue building a multi-category in order to be all things local commerce for our cities. And the last point I\u2019ll make is, we\u2019re seeing increasing adoption of our new verticals amongst our MAU base. So we\u2019ve said in Q4 last year, 14% of our MAUs had purchased from non-restaurant categories. That number in Q4 this year was 17%. So we\u2019re seeing steady growth, which is increased adoption in a larger base year-on-year of revenues.\nNikhil Devnani: Thanks, Prabir. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham. Your line is now open.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess, maybe just a clarification. I just want to make sure I got \u2013 you\u2019re right, Prabir, you said 15 million DashPass subscribers at the end of the quarter, that would be similar \u2013 or against the 10 million last year. And then if you could just discuss the payback period on those subs and if the cost to acquire them has been consistent over the last year or two.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. So first question, yes, 15 million is right. So 10 million at the end of 2021, increased to over 15 million at the end of 2022. Payback period, we\u2019ve not disclosed. We continue to run efficiently. Those payback periods have actually not materially different this year than they were earlier on in the year. So if what you\u2019re asking me is has competitor cross-selling bundles made it harder for us to acquire DashPass subscribers, we haven\u2019t seen any noticeable impact so far. I think I said earlier, the pace of DashPass subscriber growth has been relatively consistent each quarter. And on top of that, we track the number of new customers that joined the industry. Our share of new customers joining the industry has been consistent this past year. In fact, has actually increased towards the back half of this year. And so both of these data points give me comfort that we haven\u2019t seen any noticeable impact from any cross-selling.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking my question. I just had a couple about the 2023 outlook. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about APIs and kind of how you see them evolving across AOB and frequency. And I guess, in particular, on [indiscernible] and some others just about open funds. And then secondly, can you talk about gross margins a little bit, some of the tailwinds and perhaps heading in for next year? And do you need that to expand your higher EBITDA margin? Thank you.\nRavi Inukonda: This is Ravi. Let me take the question. On the first piece, on the 2023 guidance itself, in terms of KPIs, our goal is to continue to drive both monthly active users as well as order frequency. We continue to see strong signals in our retention, which has stabilized over the last several months. Newer cohorts continue to come in at order frequency, higher than what we\u2019ve seen earlier in the year. Now to your second point, can you repeat your second question?\nDoug Anmuth: Some of the gross margin puts and takes and do you need that to expand and drive EBITDA margin expansion.\nRavi Inukonda: Yes. On the gross margin piece itself, if you actually break apart the gross margin, core DoorDash gross margin, excluding Wolt actually increased on a year-on-year basis. That was driven by improvements in DASH or cost as a percentage of GOV as well as credits and refunds. Some part of that was offset by the higher insurance costs that we\u2019ve seen in the business. On a consolidated basis, gross margin declined because of mix shift towards the Wolt. Looking ahead in 2023, we do expect gross margin to be higher than Q4 levels.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morton with SVB. Your line is now open.\nMichael Morton: Thank you for question. A question on new vertical businesses. If you look at something like package pickup, it suggests that the time-sensitive nature you face in core restaurants could be lower, right, and maybe higher levels of batching. So I was wondering if you could speak to any of the early demand trends. And then unit economics you\u2019re seeing on some of these new verticals like package pickups compared to prior new verticals. And then just lastly, maybe any update on non-restaurant GOV growth would be great if you could. Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yes, sure. Maybe I can take the \u2013 it\u2019s Tony. I can take the first part of the question. And someone can answer, I think, the growth rate question, which we disclosed before. So, on the package piece, I mean we\u2019re obviously very excited about what we can build. Let me think about it. We have 3 million Dashers that come to the platform every 90 days. And we have the most sophisticated logistics systems for last mile. And when I think about the opportunity, it\u2019s quite immense just because most last-mile systems were built during the time when, frankly, there wasn\u2019t e-commerce, right, which means that a lot of the setup isn\u2019t really well suited for doing true last-mile deliveries. And that\u2019s actually why we think there\u2019s quite a lot that we can do that if we can deliver ice cream in 10 minutes or pizza in a similar period of time, we can certainly deliver something that is less perishable with greater time. And to your point, there\u2019s lots of opportunities to make the logistics really efficient. So we\u2019re quite excited about what this can be. I do think that, over time, in addition to becoming the largest local commerce marketplace, we\u2019ll also be the last mile infrastructure in most cities globally. It\u2019s just going to take quite a lot of time to get there. And the package piece is seeing quite a lot of demand. But it\u2019s pretty early, I would say, in terms of how it works. And so I think it really is a good example of how we try to solve customer problems at DoorDash. A lot of why we got into that business was really seeing some of the requests from customers come in to support and then acting upon it and running an experiment and then seeing if we can actually build a product that customers love, and then we\u2019ll actually consider the scaling afterwards. And so it\u2019s still in the period of finding and achieving product market fit. That\u2019s really where that experiment is right now. But we have many of these experiments across the Board at DoorDash, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s so fun to work here.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. And on your question on new categories growth, I think I mentioned this earlier in the call and I\u2019ll reiterated our U.S. convenience and grocery business grew roughly 60% year-on-year in Q4. Our U.S. grocery business grew roughly 100% year-on-year in Q4, and then our Wolt business grew 50% on a constant currency basis. Again, these are attractive growth rates that we\u2019re happy to post.\nMichael Morton: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Maybe a related question, Tony, you have large and growing lakes [ph] and data sets, which is maybe the most important driver of AI and machine learning models and then certainly front end center in the press nowadays. I want to know if you could talk a little bit about how you think these processes impact your business and how you leverage them on a daily basis.\nTony Xu: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. Like look, there\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m actually really glad that AI is having its kind of mainstream moments these days, and I think there is quite a lot of potential here. And I do think a lot of it is actually couched in the way that you described it, which is the importance of the data and taking that data into \u2013 translate it into pragmatic products that actually solve customer problems, right? Like that\u2019s kind of the key. And so for us, we\u2019ve actually been working with different AI in each of our products, probably for the last three years or four years now. Some of it you see in the ranking and the recommendations product we use with consumers. A lot of it you see behind the scenes with logistics. You see that now also in our support products. I mean it\u2019s really getting used across the board in other words. I think it\u2019s very hard when I think you\u2019re at the precipice of a technology to figure out the exact application in which it\u2019s going to really realize the technology\u2019s full potential. But we certainly see all of these benefits give small improvements that then compound over time. And when you\u2019re at the scale that we\u2019ve achieved in our business lines, it really adds up. And so I really think that this is going to be a big push for us on a go-forward basis or a continued big push, I should say, on a go-forward basis, and it\u2019s something I\u2019m super excited about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much and Prabir and Ravi, congrats. So, I guess a two-part question. One, the macro around the consumer seems to be a bit wobbly right now between a strong employment and dwindling balance sheet. I was wondering if maybe you can comment on what you\u2019ve seen so far in January and February. I know you\u2019ve already guided, and the guide looks really good. But if I look at the guide for the year, it seems like you\u2019re not really assuming much of an improvement Q1 to Q4, at least from a GOV standpoint. So maybe can you just address what you\u2019re seeing right now and kind of what you\u2019re baking in terms of your guide for the rest of the year in terms of sequential growth?\nRavi Inukonda: Cool, let me take this one. If you look at our results, we have consistently driven double-digit growth rate in GOV over the last seven quarters. In fact, our revenue is actually outpacing our GOV growth rate. When you look at the core consumer input metrics, we\u2019re just coming off of a record quarter in terms of monthly active users as well as DashPass subscribers. I think what we\u2019re seeing in the business is order frequency of the newer cohorts continues to be higher than the older cohorts. Retention of our newer cohorts has been pretty stable for the last several months. To your question on Q1 itself, it\u2019s off to a great start. We are seeing continued share gains since the beginning of the year, and that\u2019s what\u2019s baked into our guidance for the rest of the year as well.\nPrabir Adarkar: And just to add on the full year comment users, it\u2019s Prabir, I mean look, as Ravi said, we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019re seeing strong consumer metrics currently, right, both in Q4 and strength of the Q1. And so you\u2019ve got high visibility into the first half of the year, which is why you\u2019ve seen a strong Q1 guide. For the full year, particularly as you talk about the second half, there\u2019s uncertainty around macro issues, and we\u2019re trying to bake in that uncertainty now full year outlook because it\u2019s not about a lack of confidence in the fundamentals, it\u2019s about uncertainty on the macro conditions.\nYoussef Squali: Yes. Super helpful. Thanks, Prabir.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Boone: Thanks so much for taking my questions. Two please. Delivery Hero has made significant investments in its one piece convenience [ph] product. Can you also apply the investments of Hero [ph] one piece convenience product? And then secondly on corporate, the significant opportunity can just update your progress in terms of making more corporate relationships and office ordering? Thanks so much.\nTony Xu: Can you repeat the second question? Sorry. It was [indiscernible].\nAndrew Boone: I\u2019m thinking about the old seamless opportunity with corporate just having a more of a corporate relationship and office ordering as more people are back in office.\nTony Xu: Yes. I can take both of those questions. It\u2019s Tony. So I think the first question was around DashMarts. So we haven\u2019t broken out the investment piece behind \u2013 the investment budget for DashMarts. But here\u2019s kind of how I\u2019ve thought about DashMarts, which is first I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that it\u2019s not a standalone product, right? It\u2019s a feature built on top of the largest local commerce marketplace that has the most number of consumers who are the most engaged and also the most number of Dashers, none of whom we have to reacquire. The second comment \u2013 which makes just much more capital efficient from an investment perspective relative to a standalone effort. The second comment I\u2019d make here is really the purpose behind the investment. So if you think about where non-restaurant delivery is today, things like grocery delivery, take as an example, it really hasn\u2019t achieved the full potential of what we believe the category could become. I mean, at the end of the day, the customers looking to get everything they ordered inside their cart. They\u2019re looking for it at prices that are relatively the same as what they would expect to pay in store. And obviously they expect the delivery with greater convenience than if they were to do it on their own. But today, that\u2019s not what the current day products offer. But at the same time, we have to make sure that we can work together with retailers to bridge both the short-term challenges of working with third party retail infrastructure that isn\u2019t optimized, nor was it designed for delivery and create and invent a new model in which we can co-create with retailers such that we can move the industry forward and actually solve these customer problems to achieve the full potential of grocery delivery or non-restaurant delivery. And so that\u2019s really the purpose. And we\u2019ve found quite a lot of different use cases once you\u2019ve actually master the basics of retail, which we\u2019re still learning how to do. And we\u2019re only about 18 months into the effort, but we really like what we see. And \u2013 but I think it\u2019s important to understand just from a capital efficiency perspective, how different it is relative to doing it on a standalone basis. And I think your second question was around corporate orders. I agree, I mean, I think that obviously it took a bit of a hiatus during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic where obviously, offices were shut down and people were less confident about how work would be done and so on and so forth. And that\u2019s actually when a lot of our team was able to very quickly pivot into building products that would actually solve for workers at home as all of us kind of got more accustomed to the idea of working remotely or not in the office, especially now as people are getting back into the office. And I think things have stabilized effectively in this post COVID world. I definitely think that\u2019s a big opportunity moving forward.\nAndrew Boone: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Couple questions. First, you mentioned in the letter how you\u2019re managing for better affordability with your customers. Can you talk a little bit more about that and whether that brings you under like an inflation curve we would think of broadly or how do we think about that going forward? And similar question on, there was a paragraph talking about how you\u2019ve gotten more efficient. Obviously, you\u2019re going to get more efficient this year too on some of the things you mentioned. But like how does that curve look this year versus last year in your minds as it contributes to EBITDA? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll take the first part of the question, which I believe was around affordability, and then I\u2019ll let Robbie take the second part on the efficiency side. So on the affordability side, yes, I mean we've \u2013 as disclosed in the letter, we've taken down transaction costs for consumers by about 8% in the past year. And we're always trying to drive this down, right? And we're always trying to drive this down as we add selection, improve delivery times, improve the accuracy and the quality of those deliveries. So obviously, we're trying to do more than one thing at the same instance. But when it comes to affordability, certainly, DashPass has been a big driver of a lot of the affordability gains for our customers especially as we continue to see consistent adds into the DashPass program. But at the same time, we're working on quite a lot of other initiatives as well and to make sure that we can keep making the service more and more affordable. Certainly, we're trying to beat inflation, but hopefully, we can do much better than that, especially as we find more creative ways in delivering more and more value back to consumers.\nRavi Inukonda: Let me take the second one on efficiency. For us, when we think about efficiency, it always starts with improving product quality. When we improve product quality, the retention of the platform goes up, whether it's consumers or dashers. When the retention goes up, we don't have to spend as much on retaining existing consumers and dashers, which drives leverage on our sales and marketing. The second advantage we have when we improve product quality is the fulfillment cost per order goes down, whether it's support costs, dasher costs or credit refunds. Also, in addition to that, as the product quality goes up, awareness increases, which makes us the ability to acquire consumers and dashers at attractive prices even more attractive. The combination of these three factors is what's driving the efficiency you're seeing in the business. In our belief, there's a lot more room for us to continue to improve product quality, which will further drive efficiency gains. And our goal is to reinvest that efficiency back into driving scale in the business, and some of the efficiency gains that you see are included in our EBITDA guidance going forward.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is now open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Prabir, congrats on the promotion as President; and Ravi in your new role. I wanted to maybe follow up for Prabir, I think I heard you say 3P [ph] grocery was up 100% in 4Q. I think that's the same growth rate as in 3Q. So talk to us about how the use case is evolving here. Is Grocery and DoorDash primarily still top off? Are you getting Sunday orders? Any insights there would be helpful. And then we're now a few months post the restructuring at the end of November, and so I would love to hear insights on the savings. But perhaps more importantly, just progress operationally around efficiency and while still building and launching new products, how that's going internally? Thank you guys.\nTony Xu: Yes. Maybe let me take \u2013 I can start on both of those questions, and then I'll let others add to them. I think so again, on the first part with respect to grocery, yes, it continues to perform and continues to take share. And you're right. I mean the entry into third-party grocery really for DoorDash has been in solving this top-up use case, right, where you can think of it almost as being the express aisle in many ways. And that was a way to familiarize ourselves with consumers as we kind of moved outside of the restaurant category, and I think it was certainly something that worked. I mean you see it in the gains in share, but you also see it in the improving profitability of that business. At the same instance, we've certainly been working a lot on creating more and more an item-based shopping experience at DoorDash. Now that takes lots of work on the back end around catalog and many things, and I think that's also now showing promise where we can solve both the use case of the top-up, where I think we're quite advantaged with our logistics network as well as just how consumers perceive us, but also the stock-up use case where people are buying bigger and bigger carts for their more staple items. And so we\u2019re now seeing both of these types of use cases, even though we entered the category with more of a top-up use case.  On the second question, I\u2019ll let maybe others chime in on some of the numbers. But from an efficiency perspective, certainly, that was a really painful decision, right? I think it\u2019s helpful to have some context here of how we got there, where over the last three years, the business revenues have grown about 7x, and we were really trying to catch up to that growth, so the headcount grew about 4x. And so we\u2019re playing catch-up, but then we kind of didn\u2019t get it exactly right and kind of got a bit ahead of our skis on the hiring, and so that made certain things a bit cluttered. And certainly, we needed to make sure that we right-sized the organization so that we\u2019re set up great for the future, which we feel very confident about.  From an execution perspective, we actually feel like it\u2019s made us more focused on the most important things. And as a result, by decluttering some of the management layers as well as maybe coordination meetings that were once quite a large cost to the system, we\u2019re getting a lot better. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re perfect. We have many things still to figure out. We\u2019re still building many things as we continue to innovate beyond restaurants, as we expand internationally and as we expand beyond our marketplace and build these platform products. We\u2019re always going to keep investing and invent new products, but we have to do it with a more focused base. \nPrabir Adarkar: And on the \u2013 Ravi talked about the risk here. I just want to confirm. So yes, in Q3 of last year, Q3 2022 [ph] we said the grocery business has grown over 100%. In Q4, it grew roughly 100%, just shy of 100%. So those numbers are right.\nRavi Inukonda: Just on the leverage itself, yes, we do expect to drive leverage on our operating expenses in 2023, and that\u2019s been included in our EBITDA guidance that we\u2019ve given. \nRon Josey: Thanks, Ravi.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with RBC. Your line is now open.\nBrad Erickson: Yes, thanks. Just two follow-ups, I guess. One, on the health of the consumer. You touched on it earlier being I guess, broadly stable. Just curious if you look at Europe, I think some others have commented that may actually be getting better or maybe even accelerating at the moment. Just curious if you\u2019re seeing that too and what you\u2019ve assumed as a trajectory there for the full year guide for Europe. And then just one clarification on the grocery and convenience. Is there any \u2013 the 60% growth you\u2019ve called out, is there any meaningful delta there between the organic growth rate and the 60%? Or are they basically about the same? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: So on the first question, we haven\u2019t broken out the Wolt, but we are projecting strong growth for next year. The one caveat I will make Brad is when you look at Q1, Q1 has the Omicron comp issue, which I suspect you\u2019re hearing from other companies as well. Q1 of last year had this spike because of Omicron, and so you\u2019ll see that in the growth rates for Q1 this year. But that doesn\u2019t change our optimism and confidence in the full year outlook for Wolt. On your second question, I didn\u2019t understand what you meant by organic growth for us. The entirety of our convenience and grocery business, that growth rate is all organic. So, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what you were asking, perhaps I misunderstood the question.\nRavi Inukonda: Just try to add. I think the numbers that we were giving out were just U.S., so that was organic.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes our Q&A today and for today\u2019s conference call. Thank you so much for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ravi Inukonda",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Prabir. Thanks, Deepak, for the question. On the New York City impact, we've been thinking about this for a while now. The impact from a cost perspective is included in our EBITDA guidance going forward. We actually have a number of levers from an operational perspective that we can put in place, including passing on any fees to our audiences to ensure that we can meet our profitability expectations. Thanks, Prabir. Let me take the question on the guide. We are not breaking out any specifics, but our U.S. restaurant business is the largest business, and it's going to be the major driver both on the top line as well as the bottom line. As we talked about in the shareholder letter, we do expect to increase margins, both from our U.S. restaurants as well as all of our investment areas going into 2023. This is Ravi. Let me take the question. On the first piece, on the 2023 guidance itself, in terms of KPIs, our goal is to continue to drive both monthly active users as well as order frequency. We continue to see strong signals in our retention, which has stabilized over the last several months. Newer cohorts continue to come in at order frequency, higher than what we've seen earlier in the year. Now to your second point, can you repeat your second question? Yes. On the gross margin piece itself, if you actually break apart the gross margin, core DoorDash gross margin, excluding Wolt actually increased on a year-on-year basis. That was driven by improvements in DASH or cost as a percentage of GOV as well as credits and refunds. Some part of that was offset by the higher insurance costs that we've seen in the business. On a consolidated basis, gross margin declined because of mix shift towards the Wolt. Looking ahead in 2023, we do expect gross margin to be higher than Q4 levels. Cool, let me take this one. If you look at our results, we have consistently driven double-digit growth rate in GOV over the last seven quarters. In fact, our revenue is actually outpacing our GOV growth rate. When you look at the core consumer input metrics, we're just coming off of a record quarter in terms of monthly active users as well as DashPass subscribers. I think what we're seeing in the business is order frequency of the newer cohorts continues to be higher than the older cohorts. Retention of our newer cohorts has been pretty stable for the last several months. To your question on Q1 itself, it's off to a great start. We are seeing continued share gains since the beginning of the year, and that's what's baked into our guidance for the rest of the year as well. Let me take the second one on efficiency. For us, when we think about efficiency, it always starts with improving product quality. When we improve product quality, the retention of the platform goes up, whether it's consumers or dashers. When the retention goes up, we don't have to spend as much on retaining existing consumers and dashers, which drives leverage on our sales and marketing. The second advantage we have when we improve product quality is the fulfillment cost per order goes down, whether it's support costs, dasher costs or credit refunds. Also, in addition to that, as the product quality goes up, awareness increases, which makes us the ability to acquire consumers and dashers at attractive prices even more attractive. The combination of these three factors is what's driving the efficiency you're seeing in the business. In our belief, there's a lot more room for us to continue to improve product quality, which will further drive efficiency gains. And our goal is to reinvest that efficiency back into driving scale in the business, and some of the efficiency gains that you see are included in our EBITDA guidance going forward. Just on the leverage itself, yes, we do expect to drive leverage on our operating expenses in 2023, and that's been included in our EBITDA guidance that we've given. Just try to add. I think the numbers that we were giving out were just U.S., so that was organic."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Prabir Adarkar",
            "content": "Yes. Tony, it's Prabir. Maybe I'll add a little bit, and then Ravi can take the New York City question. Deepak, I mean, Tony alluded to the strategy to continue investing behind building out on new categories as well as international. We put up significant proof points that are quite encouraging in terms of our progress in building scale. So just a couple of data points. Last quarter, we had said our U.S. convenience and grocery business, this was in Q3, had GOV growth of over 80%. That business grew 60% year-on-year in Q4, so it still continues to grow at meaningfully higher growth rates compared to the restaurants. Our third-party U.S. grocery business grew 100% year-on-year, both in Q3 and Q4. And in Wolt, as we alluded to in our shareholder letter, on a constant currency basis has grown 50% year-on-year, which is again significantly faster than its European peers. And so I take this as positive proof points in terms of not just product market fit, but our ability to drive scale on the platform. In addition, we've got proof points of continued improvement in unit economics. So we talked about a third-party convenience business. In fact, earlier in 2022, we said it would get to breakeven on a variable profit basis in 2022. In Q4, we did exactly what we said we were going to do. We got to variable profit breakeven. Our third-party grocery business continues to improve its margins. So to be clear, we have a long way to go. But as we continue to improve the products and the part experience, we believe we will continue to drive outsized growth in all of these areas that we're investing behind and continued margin improvement. Ravi, do you want to take the New York City question? Yes. Maybe I'll start on the DashPass question, Brian, and Ravi can chime in on the 2023 guidance question in terms of what's driving the growth there. Really, look, the DashPass growth has been remarkably consistent over the course of this past year. We exited 2021 with 10 million subscribers. We're exiting this year with 15 million. And that \u2013 the pace of that growth has been consistent despite a variety of competitor offerings from both of our competitors in the space. And what that goes to is just evidence, to me at least, that the combination of selection, price and quality that we offer through our program is resonating with customers. In terms of what's driving the growth, it's not been partnership-driven as some of our competitors might be. That's a competitive strategy that others are using. The majority of our growth, at least as far as the DashPass program goes, is from our own channels as well as through traditional performance marketing channels. So these are \u2013 it's not partnership-driven. These are organic channels that ultimately drive that we've seen in the product. Second, the pace continues pretty consistently, and so there's a lot of room to grow. If you think about the size of the DashPass program at 15 million subs, it's still a far cry from other programs, whether it's the number of Netflix members or Prime subscribers, there's a lot of room for us to continue growing. And we're happy with the pace of growth historically, and we're not seeing any signs of that slowing down. And just on the competitive dynamic question. I mean you asked the question on market share. Your third-party data, particularly in some of the countries where Wolt operates, isn't clean. But if you just simply look at their constant currency growth rate of 50% and you compare it to the European peers or European divisions of more global peers, the Wolt business is growing significantly faster. So to me, that suggests market share gains despite the fact that we don't have precise third-party data to back that up. Hey Lloyd, I mean on the question of guidance philosophy, the way we guide and the way we run the business, I mean none of that's changed, right? And we've said historically, the way we run the business is try to maximize scale and put as much on the top line as possible. The \u2013 and we're investing in that regard in order to maximize scale. Now as far as the EBITDA guidance goes, the guidance range is really meant to create a sense of discipline so that we ensure we can try to follow within the range. Now precisely where we fall, it depends on the exact investment opportunities available and their returns versus our expectations. And so to the extent, as you pointed out, investments are available, and we like the returns to our payback thresholds, we will invest. In recent times, what we've seen as we've outperformed on the top line, whether there's been strength in consumer metrics, you've seen our MAU metrics, you've seen our DashPass numbers that has contributed to incremental top line, that has helped us get closer to the top end of the EBITDA range despite a healthy level of investment. So that's just to clarify where we've landed in the range, but the objective, A, philosophy has not changed in terms of how we manage the business and invest for growth. And then B, our objective is not to try to beat the EBITDA range to retire land within it. And Mike, just one technical point is that one of the five restaurants goes out of business each year, right? So there's \u2013 this is a moving target. There's constantly new restaurants that are appearing that we need to make sure we're staying ahead of. And so the sales team is always busy, and they're always putting up bigger and bigger targets in order to make sure that the selection that's available on our platform is fresh. Nikhil, maybe I'll take the first one. The cohort level margins, they're healthy and they're progressing well. We showed you last quarter the total contribution profit for the U.S. restaurant business, which is essentially the aggregated performance of all the cohorts. And so if you take a step back, the contribution profit of our core business has consistently improved over the past few years, despite post-COVID reopening, despite Prop 22, which is a regulatory shop the system inflation and other things, and this is really the output of this focus on improving the efficiency of our logistics network, improving our defect rates and so on. And so we could \u2013 the purpose of that disclosure was to try to provide a simplified view of the progression that we have seen to the cohort margins but on an aggregated basis and to give you a sense of the incremental margins we are seeing in the U.S. restaurant business that are in line with what we've said historically. And can you remind me of the second question, please? I got it. Yes, yes. So it's two things. So it's strategically important for two purposes. First, we see a growing number of new customers starting with non-restaurant categories. So yes, it is a source of customer acquisition because there might be customers out there that didn't find the restaurant they were looking for. And now they find DoorDash interesting because their favorite grocery store, their favorite convenience store is on the platform. So yes, a growing number of new customers start their journey with DoorDash with the new \u2013 with the non-restaurant categories. Second, at least \u2013 and this is based on early signals, the work we've done at least so far, preliminary seems to suggest that customers who order from both restaurants and non-restaurant categories have an increase in their order rate, which is the product of retention and order frequency compared to those that are single categories. So both of these things are important reasons for us to continue building a multi-category in order to be all things local commerce for our cities. And the last point I'll make is, we're seeing increasing adoption of our new verticals amongst our MAU base. So we've said in Q4 last year, 14% of our MAUs had purchased from non-restaurant categories. That number in Q4 this year was 17%. So we're seeing steady growth, which is increased adoption in a larger base year-on-year of revenues. Yes. So first question, yes, 15 million is right. So 10 million at the end of 2021, increased to over 15 million at the end of 2022. Payback period, we've not disclosed. We continue to run efficiently. Those payback periods have actually not materially different this year than they were earlier on in the year. So if what you're asking me is has competitor cross-selling bundles made it harder for us to acquire DashPass subscribers, we haven't seen any noticeable impact so far. I think I said earlier, the pace of DashPass subscriber growth has been relatively consistent each quarter. And on top of that, we track the number of new customers that joined the industry. Our share of new customers joining the industry has been consistent this past year. In fact, has actually increased towards the back half of this year. And so both of these data points give me comfort that we haven't seen any noticeable impact from any cross-selling. Yes. And on your question on new categories growth, I think I mentioned this earlier in the call and I'll reiterated our U.S. convenience and grocery business grew roughly 60% year-on-year in Q4. Our U.S. grocery business grew roughly 100% year-on-year in Q4, and then our Wolt business grew 50% on a constant currency basis. Again, these are attractive growth rates that we're happy to post. And just to add on the full year comment users, it's Prabir, I mean look, as Ravi said, we've got \u2013 we're seeing strong consumer metrics currently, right, both in Q4 and strength of the Q1. And so you've got high visibility into the first half of the year, which is why you've seen a strong Q1 guide. For the full year, particularly as you talk about the second half, there's uncertainty around macro issues, and we're trying to bake in that uncertainty now full year outlook because it's not about a lack of confidence in the fundamentals, it's about uncertainty on the macro conditions. And on the \u2013 Ravi talked about the risk here. I just want to confirm. So yes, in Q3 of last year, Q3 2022 [ph] we said the grocery business has grown over 100%. In Q4, it grew roughly 100%, just shy of 100%. So those numbers are right. So on the first question, we haven't broken out the Wolt, but we are projecting strong growth for next year. The one caveat I will make Brad is when you look at Q1, Q1 has the Omicron comp issue, which I suspect you're hearing from other companies as well. Q1 of last year had this spike because of Omicron, and so you'll see that in the growth rates for Q1 this year. But that doesn't change our optimism and confidence in the full year outlook for Wolt. On your second question, I didn't understand what you meant by organic growth for us. The entirety of our convenience and grocery business, that growth rate is all organic. So, I'm not sure if that's what you were asking, perhaps I misunderstood the question."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Typically, we just dive right into Q&A. But for today's call, I wanted to say a few words at the top about Christopher, Prabir and Ravi. I'm sure many of you have seen the news that we're naming Prabir, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Ravi as CFO as Christopher retires from operating roles and day-to-day management. In his seven-plus years here, Christopher, or CP as we call him internally, has helped to shape our business and our culture. He infused an operator mindset across the company and coached an entire generation of our leaders. On a personal level, I will miss him. I've learned so much from him and consider myself lucky to count him as a business partner and friend. Today's news is a chance to celebrate CP's 33 incredible years as an operator and what he has helped us build. It also shows the strength of our systems and the amazing team we have built at DoorDash. Prabir and Ravi have been with us for more than four years and have mastered every aspect of our business. Both are without equal in this space, and I'm excited for what they'll achieve and what we'll continue building together. Over our near 10-year history, DoorDash has been fortunate to have had a remarkably stable and high-quality leadership team. Nonetheless, everyone in our team has a succession plan. We knew that CP wouldn't always be here, and we've been ready for this possibility for some time. And we're always developing our bench of talent as well as our systems and processes so that the right people can step up when ready. We operate in a very complicated and dynamic space, and the understanding of nuance and the ability to translate this intuition into pragmatic judgment takes time. We're lucky that we have two people who've been grooming for a while and a group of operators behind them to continue executing with excellence without skipping a beat. Prabir and Ravi are also excellent stewards of our unique culture. Again, I want to thank CP for everything he's done and congratulate both Prabir and Ravi. I'm super excited for what's ahead because as CP likes to say, we're just getting started. With that, I'll turn it back over to Andy, and let's get started with your questions. Hey Deepak, I'll take a stab at both of those questions. And feel free, others, to chime in. I think your first question was really just around how we were thinking about our capital allocation. To start, I think, it's important to just level set on our philosophy for investing, which has stayed the same ever since we've been a public company and really has been the same since day one in building DoorDash, which is our goal is to maximize long-term profit dollars. And so that both has a scale component to it as well as a unit economics component to it. And to me, both of them are very important and it's most important to get the sequencing right so that we are allocating capital in the most efficient ways. So, when you look at this allocation for whether it's 2023 or in the years to come, a lot of the investment is going towards in building our categories beyond restaurants, both in the United States as well as globally, as well as our operations outside of the U.S. as we're now live in 26 countries. I mean, I think it's been remarkable, the progress that we've seen so far in both the share gains, as well as just the level of product market fit that we've achieved in both of these dimensions. With new categories, we're now the largest platform with the most amount of partners outside of restaurants in North America. We've gained share in the majority of our international markets. And our Vault business overseas in Europe is growing much faster than peers. And so we're seeing a lot of progress there, and we're doubling on that momentum. At the same time, we're very observant about our unit economics. And a lot of that progression is reflected in some of the guidance that we shared for 2023, but also in what we expect to see on a go-forward basis as we continue to improve the efficiency of our operations in addition to the quality of our product level. Anyone else wants to add on the first question? Hey Eric, it's Tony. I'll get started, and others can chime in. I think the thesis for Wolt has remained remarkably consistent. When we met the team two years ago, we were first struck by how similar we were as operators and how we thought about just building businesses. But at the same time, what we were really impressed by from a business perspective was just the superior level of retention and order frequency it had achieved with its product relative to peers. And I think that remains to be what we've seen today in the data as we've now been partners for a couple of years now, where you just see the constant progression of its outperformance on a relative basis. And it's just coming from those cohorts getting larger that retain at higher levels who order and engage more often. That, effectively, the geometric sequence of growth that is what you're seeing on a relative basis. It actually isn't that much yet attributed to its subscription products or anything else, which actually lends to its future potential. I mean there's a couple of things that we're pretty excited about. One is just how under-penetrated it is in most of its geographies. And even its most mature established markets, Wolt actually serves a fraction of the actual population. And second, to the premise of the question, there are quite a lot of products that Wolt hasn't yet introduced. And in most of these markets, I think there also doesn't really exist that much e-commerce in terms of its behavior relative to some of what you see here in the United States, and so I think there's a lot of opportunity across a variety of vectors for growth. Yes. Hey Michael, so we've continued to see growth in the selection on the platform, and that's true both for restaurants, and that's also true for non-restaurants. Actually, I'd say there's kind of a confluence of two external factors in addition to just, I think the team's great execution, which is, one, you just see more and more physical retailers digitizing their entire business, which both is a tailwind to our marketplace of joining the marketplace for the first time. I mean if you looked at some of the brands that we onboarded in 2022, a lot of that even diversified beyond restaurants into the grocery sector with additions like Sprouts or Raley's. We announced all these earlier this year. Then you have additions in the retail category, whether it be Sephora or DICK'S Sporting Goods. So a lot of these retailers are digitizing more of their business and coming online to get that incremental business from the largest local commerce marketplace. The second kind of thing that's happening is the fact that because they're trying to digitize their entire operations at these retailers, they are also partnering with our platform products as well, products like DoorDash Drive, DoorDash Storefronts, where they're trying to run more of their business in a fashion that both I think takes advantage of the convenience economy, but also I think, just creates a better business model for themselves, right, where they can make more productive use of their square footage by adding more and more sales into a fixed space. And so that's what we're seeing. We're seeing the quite a lot of additions, non-stop, candidly, both on the restaurant side as well as on the non-restaurant front. Yes, sure. Maybe I can take the \u2013 it's Tony. I can take the first part of the question. And someone can answer, I think, the growth rate question, which we disclosed before. So, on the package piece, I mean we're obviously very excited about what we can build. Let me think about it. We have 3 million Dashers that come to the platform every 90 days. And we have the most sophisticated logistics systems for last mile. And when I think about the opportunity, it's quite immense just because most last-mile systems were built during the time when, frankly, there wasn't e-commerce, right, which means that a lot of the setup isn't really well suited for doing true last-mile deliveries. And that's actually why we think there's quite a lot that we can do that if we can deliver ice cream in 10 minutes or pizza in a similar period of time, we can certainly deliver something that is less perishable with greater time. And to your point, there's lots of opportunities to make the logistics really efficient. So we're quite excited about what this can be. I do think that, over time, in addition to becoming the largest local commerce marketplace, we'll also be the last mile infrastructure in most cities globally. It's just going to take quite a lot of time to get there. And the package piece is seeing quite a lot of demand. But it's pretty early, I would say, in terms of how it works. And so I think it really is a good example of how we try to solve customer problems at DoorDash. A lot of why we got into that business was really seeing some of the requests from customers come in to support and then acting upon it and running an experiment and then seeing if we can actually build a product that customers love, and then we'll actually consider the scaling afterwards. And so it's still in the period of finding and achieving product market fit. That's really where that experiment is right now. But we have many of these experiments across the Board at DoorDash, and that's one of the reasons why it's so fun to work here. Yes, it's a great question. Like look, there's \u2013 I'm actually really glad that AI is having its kind of mainstream moments these days, and I think there is quite a lot of potential here. And I do think a lot of it is actually couched in the way that you described it, which is the importance of the data and taking that data into \u2013 translate it into pragmatic products that actually solve customer problems, right? Like that's kind of the key. And so for us, we've actually been working with different AI in each of our products, probably for the last three years or four years now. Some of it you see in the ranking and the recommendations product we use with consumers. A lot of it you see behind the scenes with logistics. You see that now also in our support products. I mean it's really getting used across the board in other words. I think it's very hard when I think you're at the precipice of a technology to figure out the exact application in which it's going to really realize the technology's full potential. But we certainly see all of these benefits give small improvements that then compound over time. And when you're at the scale that we've achieved in our business lines, it really adds up. And so I really think that this is going to be a big push for us on a go-forward basis or a continued big push, I should say, on a go-forward basis, and it's something I'm super excited about. Can you repeat the second question? Sorry. It was [indiscernible]. Yes. I can take both of those questions. It's Tony. So I think the first question was around DashMarts. So we haven't broken out the investment piece behind \u2013 the investment budget for DashMarts. But here's kind of how I've thought about DashMarts, which is first I think it's important to acknowledge that it's not a standalone product, right? It's a feature built on top of the largest local commerce marketplace that has the most number of consumers who are the most engaged and also the most number of Dashers, none of whom we have to reacquire. The second comment \u2013 which makes just much more capital efficient from an investment perspective relative to a standalone effort. The second comment I'd make here is really the purpose behind the investment. So if you think about where non-restaurant delivery is today, things like grocery delivery, take as an example, it really hasn't achieved the full potential of what we believe the category could become. I mean, at the end of the day, the customers looking to get everything they ordered inside their cart. They're looking for it at prices that are relatively the same as what they would expect to pay in store. And obviously they expect the delivery with greater convenience than if they were to do it on their own. But today, that's not what the current day products offer. But at the same time, we have to make sure that we can work together with retailers to bridge both the short-term challenges of working with third party retail infrastructure that isn't optimized, nor was it designed for delivery and create and invent a new model in which we can co-create with retailers such that we can move the industry forward and actually solve these customer problems to achieve the full potential of grocery delivery or non-restaurant delivery. And so that's really the purpose. And we've found quite a lot of different use cases once you've actually master the basics of retail, which we're still learning how to do. And we're only about 18 months into the effort, but we really like what we see. And \u2013 but I think it's important to understand just from a capital efficiency perspective, how different it is relative to doing it on a standalone basis. And I think your second question was around corporate orders. I agree, I mean, I think that obviously it took a bit of a hiatus during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic where obviously, offices were shut down and people were less confident about how work would be done and so on and so forth. And that's actually when a lot of our team was able to very quickly pivot into building products that would actually solve for workers at home as all of us kind of got more accustomed to the idea of working remotely or not in the office, especially now as people are getting back into the office. And I think things have stabilized effectively in this post COVID world. I definitely think that's a big opportunity moving forward. Sure. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question, which I believe was around affordability, and then I'll let Robbie take the second part on the efficiency side. So on the affordability side, yes, I mean we've \u2013 as disclosed in the letter, we've taken down transaction costs for consumers by about 8% in the past year. And we're always trying to drive this down, right? And we're always trying to drive this down as we add selection, improve delivery times, improve the accuracy and the quality of those deliveries. So obviously, we're trying to do more than one thing at the same instance. But when it comes to affordability, certainly, DashPass has been a big driver of a lot of the affordability gains for our customers especially as we continue to see consistent adds into the DashPass program. But at the same time, we're working on quite a lot of other initiatives as well and to make sure that we can keep making the service more and more affordable. Certainly, we're trying to beat inflation, but hopefully, we can do much better than that, especially as we find more creative ways in delivering more and more value back to consumers. Yes. Maybe let me take \u2013 I can start on both of those questions, and then I'll let others add to them. I think so again, on the first part with respect to grocery, yes, it continues to perform and continues to take share. And you're right. I mean the entry into third-party grocery really for DoorDash has been in solving this top-up use case, right, where you can think of it almost as being the express aisle in many ways. And that was a way to familiarize ourselves with consumers as we kind of moved outside of the restaurant category, and I think it was certainly something that worked. I mean you see it in the gains in share, but you also see it in the improving profitability of that business. At the same instance, we've certainly been working a lot on creating more and more an item-based shopping experience at DoorDash. Now that takes lots of work on the back end around catalog and many things, and I think that's also now showing promise where we can solve both the use case of the top-up, where I think we're quite advantaged with our logistics network as well as just how consumers perceive us, but also the stock-up use case where people are buying bigger and bigger carts for their more staple items. And so we're now seeing both of these types of use cases, even though we entered the category with more of a top-up use case.  On the second question, I'll let maybe others chime in on some of the numbers. But from an efficiency perspective, certainly, that was a really painful decision, right? I think it's helpful to have some context here of how we got there, where over the last three years, the business revenues have grown about 7x, and we were really trying to catch up to that growth, so the headcount grew about 4x. And so we're playing catch-up, but then we kind of didn't get it exactly right and kind of got a bit ahead of our skis on the hiring, and so that made certain things a bit cluttered. And certainly, we needed to make sure that we right-sized the organization so that we're set up great for the future, which we feel very confident about.  From an execution perspective, we actually feel like it's made us more focused on the most important things. And as a result, by decluttering some of the management layers as well as maybe coordination meetings that were once quite a large cost to the system, we're getting a lot better. It doesn't mean we're perfect. We have many things still to figure out. We're still building many things as we continue to innovate beyond restaurants, as we expand internationally and as we expand beyond our marketplace and build these platform products. We're always going to keep investing and invent new products, but we have to do it with a more focused base."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Heather, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would welcome everyone to the Q3 2022 DASH Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Andy Hargraves, you may begin your conference. \nAndy Hargreaves: Thanks, Heather. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for our third quarter of 2022 earnings call. I'm pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair, and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar. We'll be making forward-looking statements during today's call, including our expectations of our business, the macroeconomic environment, financial position, and operating performance, our market and local commerce opportunities, future financial results and guidance, our strategies and our investment approach. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described and some such risks are described in our risk factors included in our SEC filings, including our 10-K and 10-Q. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial results including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our Letter to Shareholders, which is available on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. As in previous quarters, we'll go straight to questions. So with that, Heather, please open the line to the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nRoss Sandler : Hey guys, Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just starting with macro, any color on what you're seeing across either the U.S. or international markets thus far in 4Q, where are trends holding up pretty well versus possibly slowing down a bit? And then the second question is, thanks for the chart on contribution margin for the U.S. restaurant that's very helpful. In the letter, you mentioned that the last few quarters, you've been above that 7% level.  So could you just talk about what are the biggest drivers of that? Is that higher percent of repeats and getting some marketing efficiency out of that? Or is that driver efficiencies? Any color on what's taking that north of 7%? And are there markets that are in the double digits? Or is there like a natural limit to how high that could get?\nTony Xu: Hey, Ross, it's Tony. I'll start with the first one and answer briefly the second and hand it off to Prabir. On the first question, obviously, we've seen tremendous resilience in the business. In the U.S. business, you've seen continued growth north of 25% GOV, on the marketplace revenues north of 30% growth each -- for each of the last 5 quarters now. And on the flip side, this is in the face of an energy crisis, pretty sticky inflation and a war in Europe, and so it's sometimes hard to try to square the two. But I think the way that we've been thinking about things is really looking at it from a historical current day and future perspective. Historically, in the last 60 years in that time frame. Only two of the last 60 years have we seen a decline in food spend in the U.S., and that's specifically in the restaurant and grocery industries. And so I think even though all of us are wondering how to quantify the macro headwinds. Food is the most resilient category. I think historically, that's shown to be true. Current day, what we see in our own business is something largely the same. We also disclosed in the results that we saw our monthly active consumers grow, all-time highs in our DashPass membership program. And so what you're seeing is order rates of those who joined after the pandemic have largely resembled those who joined during the pandemic. Certainly, you see some softness and impact on the non-DashPass cohorts on a relative basis. But by and large, we're talking about extraordinarily similar types of ordering behavior. So that's what we see kind of currently. So on a go-forward basis, when I kind of square everything, I mean even as the market leader, sometimes it's hard to remember, but we're still less than 10% of the U.S. restaurant industry sales. When you look overseas, we're a much lower percentage than that. And so when I square, I think, the fundamentals, both in terms of the leading industry retention and order frequency in the U.S. business, the industry-leading retention order frequency in the European business, particularly with Volt, who grew at 60% on a euro basis, significantly faster than its peers, and then I square that strong fundamentals with the future potential and runway in these categories, I think that's why you're seeing the resilience as well as what was reflected in our guidance. On the second question, I think one of the things that -- and I'll let Prabir kind of talk about some of the details and specifics with respect to the contribution margin disclosure. But I think when I take a step back of what has happened in the last 2.5 years, obviously, there was a pandemic. There was a lot of changes in the macro climate as we've seen particularly '22 versus '21. We've seen regulatory pressures with the likes of Prop 22. And in spite of, I think, all of those ups, downs, sideways twist and turns, our business has grown fourfold the U.S. marketplace business. We've gained an extra 14 points of category share even as the market leader heading into the pandemic, and we've kind of extended that lead. And so I think I'm really proud of the team for being able to operate in such volatility. And so how did that happen? Well, I wish there was a silver bullet, but there really isn't. This is a business where you really have to be in the details. Every line item counts, every line item matters, every line item compounds, their interaction affects and dynamics in between the line items. And it's really measuring and managing all of these inches that, I think, has given us the compound interest and advantage that you've seen now accrue over the last 2.5 years.\nPrabir Adarkar: Ross, it's Prabir. Just to add on to Tony's point. Look, in comparison to other areas of e-commerce, frankly, other consumer tech companies who have been fairly resilient, and I think that's a function of a couple of things, it's the stickiness of the category we operate in as well as the best-in-class retention with our product. Logically, there is some impact from macro, but that impact seems to be much more limited to less obituated, more occasional customers. DashPass on the other hand, is higher retentions we've talked about in the past, and the user behavior for DashPass continues to remain strong. And so all that to say that when you look at our consumer metrics in Q3 as well as now in October, consumer metrics continue to remain strong. Tony pointed to our monthly active users that have grown both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Order frequency has grown year-on-year. Pace of customer acquisition continues to remain strong. And all of that basically establishes a foundation for solid growth, not just in Q4, but into 2023, and that's what we're really seeing in the results. So that's the color that of macro.  On your question on the contribution margin, I think your specific question was why our 2022 incremental is higher than the average of 7%. 2021 was impacted by higher DashPass cost due to a more expensive labor market. Today, the labor market has normalized. But in addition, we've actually made certain product improvements that have enhanced the retention of our existing fleet of Dasher and also an incremental supply hours from each Dasher. And a combination of these two things, has actually led to a benefit in terms of Dasher all-in cost that includes cost per order as well as Dasher acquisition costs.  And so this benefit in Dasher costs in 2022 has led to higher incremental this year compared to the general average. Those product improvements will continue benefiting our cost structure. And so you see the impact of that, by the way, in our Q4 EBITDA guidance. And then on your question about other markets above 7% and so on and so forth, I just wanted to remind everyone on what we've said historically, which was we don't operate our business to a target margin, but rather we aim to maximize total profit dollars. And the objective we have in providing the incremental percentages as well as the progression and contribution profit through all -- through COVID, through COVID reopening, through Prop 22, through inflation and all these factors was really to provide proof points on our execution and to provide visibility into our margin trajectory going forward. And so practically, what that means is we will flex margins that increases total profit dollars.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan. Your line is now open.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. On the non-restaurant piece and the drag on profitability, can you rank order, maybe put some percentages around the largest drags on total company profitability, whether it's grocery convenience or international? And then just thinking through maybe what needs to happen to unlock those to be profitable, whether it's scale or technology advancements.\nTony Xu: Yes. Maybe I can start. It's Tony, and then I'll hand it to Prabir on, I think, some of the numbers. I think it starts -- it's important to understand why we're investing in some of these categories. I mean the goal of DoorDash was always to build the largest local commerce marketplace and the largest local commerce platform in an effort to make sure that every physical business can be successful as they move into the digital economy. And our investments into both our non-restaurants category as well as our non-U.S. operations, I think, are really bearing fruit. If you looked at what has transpired in the last couple of years, we effectively have grown a business that was largely 0 in the non-restaurants category into several businesses of billions of dollars of GOV run rate with improving margin economics. And the third-party convenience business is a category leader as well as a variable profit breakeven. As one example, for instance, the earliest business that we started outside the restaurants category. Today, we have over 75,000 partners outside of restaurants, which is more than any other platform in North America, again, from almost a standing start a couple of years ago. And so the way we think about investing again is similar to what Prabir said to the last question around maximizing total long-term cash flow. And as we see projects, we invest according to what stage they're at. And so as long as we're seeing product market fit signals, we'll continue to invest. And if we don't, we'll pull back.\nPrabir Adarkar: And just to add to Tony's comments, Bernie, let me share a couple of data points that give us excitement and conviction around these investments. The first point, which we've made in the past is these markets that were attempting to expand into, whether the new categories or international, these are large trillion-dollar market and even a few points of penetration in these large markets could add massive scale to our business. Second, we're seeing very strong signs of progress. And in some cases, we've been operating in these areas for less than a couple of years. Our new verticals, our convenience and grocery business is growing over 80% year-on-year. Our U.S. third-party grocery business is growing over 100% year-on-year, and that's significantly faster than other companies that operate in this space. Our international business is growing over 50% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. And you compare that to other European food delivery players that are showing single-digit year-on-year growth rate, and so our performance is a function of the fact that we've built a product that people like and keep coming back to, i.e., better retention and growing order frequency. And so we like what we see in terms of product market fit. This is exactly the thesis that we had laid out when we made these investments, a little investment in both or investments in our new categories, and they're playing out just as we had originally talked they would. Now in terms of profitability, we wouldn't do any of these things unless we believe there was a path to attractive unit economics. And as Tony alluded earlier, we measure these things regularly to ensure that the steady progress is being made towards steady-state economics. We're beginning to see early proof points, some of which we cited in the letter.  And third-party convenience, we expect to get to a variable profit breakeven by the end of this year. We had committed to this earlier on in the year, and we're on track to deliver on that commitment. And our third-party grocery business will continue to improve margins. Q3 margins are better than Q2. And so these are exciting proof points along the way. And if you look at what we have done in the U.S. restaurant business, which we've laid out in great detail in the shareholder letter, it's about repeating those playbooks in these other areas. It's not -- there's no single silver bullet. It's the exact same factors around improving the efficiency of deliveries, optimizing defect rates that ultimately will help these areas get to profitability just like the U.S. business did. And so we have a long way to go, but we continue to improve products. We continue to get more efficient. We believe we can drive outsized growth along with margin improvement.\nBernie McTernan: Great, thank you. And thanks for all the data in the release. It's really helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan. Your line is now open. \nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Tony, a question on investing for the long term. Your philosophy is very clear, and it makes a lot of sense. But interest rates have gone up a lot in the last like three to six months. Clearly, that's made the cost of capital for many businesses higher. But as you kind of think about internally for prioritizing projects for higher ROIs or maybe faster payback periods kind of for this new capital environment, how are you sort of approaching this in the context of your investing philosophy? And then second question, maybe for Prabir. The disclosure on U.S. restaurant contribution margin is very helpful. But maybe given that it's one of your oldest business, how should we think about the growth of it right now? There's a lot of concern that core U.S. restaurant marketplace is maturing. Maybe you can help address that at least qualitatively, that would be great.\nTony Xu: Sure. Deepak, I'll take the first one. With respect to investing, frankly, in any environment, whether we're talking about a low interest rate environment or a high interest environment, we're obviously taking that as one input into how we make investments. But the primary input there's always going to be, are we investing appropriate to the stage of the project? I think it's just as easy to overinvest when \"times\" are good even though you're not seeing the signal that you want to see. And we've been very disciplined about that, whether it's been our entry into other countries or our foray into other categories beyond the restaurant category, our build-out of the advertising business. And then on the flip side, I think sometimes you cannot take enough risk, especially when you have a strong, robust, resilient business that gives you the cash flows to invest in some of these other categories. So from where I sit, certainly, we're taking that into account in terms of the cost of capital and making sure that we're operating with discipline, making sure that as we've grown tremendously the company over the last couple of years that we're as efficient as we were heading into the last couple of years. And that takes a lot of discipline, but it also takes a lot of intentional focus to make sure that we're not just investing in people, but we're investing in the systems to allow us to see operating leverage into the future. And so those are the things that we're doing to make sure that we're investing with discipline. But I would still say the primary input, especially as we look into some of these investments into newer areas, whether it's overseas or into other categories or into new business areas, it's really, are we investing appropriate to the stage of the project?\nPrabir Adarkar: And just add one more comment to that, Deepak, which is I'll go back to my comment about the size of these markets. These are large trillion-dollar markets, where money can be made. And given a small amount of penetration in these markets, there's a lot of GMV that can convert our committee free cash flow. And so if you just pencil out the math in the scale of these opportunities and our success with execution historically, the ROI math will work. So to be honest, it what makes the math work is essentially the scale of these opportunities combined with our execution. On your question, regarding sort of the U.S. business and growth. I'll point you to a couple of things, which is it's easy to get stuck in the quarter-to-quarter sort of dynamic, and you've got third-party data providers that sometimes provide data with very little basis. But what I will say is the following, which is our level of penetration even in the U.S. remains small, whether it's a percentage of overall restaurant sales or a percentage of the population that are actually using DoorDash were a small portion of the overall opportunity, and we continue to grow. MAUs have continued to grow, which is a good sign. Even despite the fact that you've had restaurants reopening, cities reopening, people going back into the store, despite that and through that, our business has continued to grow. Whereas in other areas of e-commerce, we've actually seen the growth expectations been taken down. And what that points to is the fact that this is an enduring category. People eat. People eat regardless of what's happening to inflationary pressures and other things. They may modulate their behavior and adjust from which restaurants they're eating at or the number of items in their basket and so on, but they still eat. And you're seeing the resilience of that habit in our numbers. And so the opportunity as we look forward in order to continue increasing the size of the scale of the business is for us to make progress on the fundamentals, which is selection, quality and affordability. We talked about new categories. Part of the reason we're bringing on new categories is because it's a new use case for those people that perhaps don't want to use DoorDash for restaurants, they can now use it to get the flowers or get their convenience items or get their grocery items or get their liquor delivery.  And so a growing number of our new customers now are actually coming to DoorDash to try these new categories, and this is going to unlock the next leg of growth as we continue increasing our penetration of the U.S. population. So hopefully, that provides some perspective on how I think about growth on a go-forward basis.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. First, maybe taking a step back in a bigger picture question. I understood the changed consumer behavior you're seeing and the long runway on penetration. What impact has lower competitive intensity played in the industry over the last 6 to 8 months? And how do you think that potentially informs elements of some of the more mature markets seeing only 2 or 3 players in some instances going after some of the market opportunities where it was just a couple of quarters ago that there was a lot of private capital in the sector looking at all different aspects of delivery and some of that has been more rationalized over the last couple of quarters? That would be number one. And then in markets where you're more of a challenger brand than a market leader as a result of some of the markets you acquired through the Wolt acquisition. Can you help us better understand how you see moving the needle from where your market share position is today to more of a market-leading position in the next couple of years? What are some of the levers you most focused on executing against?\nTony Xu: Yes. Maybe I can start, Eric, and I'll let Prabir chime in here. I think the answer to both of those questions to that it's a very competitive industry out there. And I'm not sure that there's ever been a \"letdown\" in terms of competitive intensity. And that's because, at least from where I sit, I believe the highest form of competition is always growing, and that's really consumer expectations.  I think to me, whether we are the market leader or where we are not yet the market leader, it's really about an investment in product quality. Consumers are always going to expect more selection of stores they can order from, greater affordability, better quality of service and superior customer support. And to me, that really at the end of the day is what's going to rate limit our ability to penetrate the large runways that both Prabir and I have discussed, whether it's the restaurant industry, the grocery industry, the retail categories. And that's really what we see. But I wouldn't say that there's been lower competitive intensity in one form or another. I still think that the biggest challenge is making sure that we can get consumers to actually try the product. I also would say that with respect to maybe the premise in the second question, I think there's a common miss out there that Wolt is not a market leader in the majority of its markets when it actually is. And so I do think that some of this might just be where there's some unreliable third-party reporting. But what I would say is both the instruction I give to our U.S. teams or our teams overseas, it's making sure that we continue making sure to invest in the product quality so that we see gains in our retention and order frequency, which only leads us to compound that advantage over time, whether that's as the market leader or whether that's someone just entering the market.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. And just to add one data point to that, Eric. I mean if you just look at Wolt's performance, we were super proud of the team and what they've built. In Q3, they grew 60% year-on-year in euro terms. Now I can't think of an example of another European food delivery company that's going at those rates. And from what I've seen, they're growing single digits\u2019 year-on-year. So it's hard to sit here and say that Wolt is not gaining share just given the disparity in growth rates versus relying on third-party data and issues with their approaches and so on. So I rely on the absolute growth rate, which is, in my mind, a pretty reliable proof point around the fact that the Wolt team has created a product and experience that has higher retention, enables growing order frequency, and that's what's allowed them to produce the growth rates that they're posting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee. Your line is now open.\nJames Lee: Two here, please. First off, DashPass, I was wondering, is there any flexibility or room to increase your fees given your expanded offering and value proposition to customers? And also on DashSmart, can you guys talk about the pace of investments in there in terms of new stores and geographic expansion? Any change in consumer behavior or unit economics to help you to kind of affirm your long-term thinking there? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Thanks for the question, James. I'll take the first one and then Tony can talk with a second. Just as a general philosophy, we're trying to improve selection quality and affordability. And particularly in the third dimension, affordability means -- to us means reducing friction that's caused by consumer fees, whether it's through DashPass or the non-DashPass product. It's trying to reduce fees or commissions on merchants and increase Dasher earnings. So in our case, we don't need to increase DashPass rates as a way of making the unit economics work because even at their current rates, DashPass economics word fine even without taking into account the subscription fee. So I view an increase in subscription fee at DashPass as being something that would actually slow down the pace of DashPass adoption which we've been very happy with so far. It continues to remain the largest paid membership program in the food category. We hit record highs in terms of our dashboard subscribers. And the pace of growth in this program has frankly been consistent despite some of the partnerships that other competitors may have entered into or despite the bundled offerings that other competitors may be providing. I mean despite all of those things, we're seeing DashPass grow. So we like the way it's set up. We like the way it's position us for growth. And at least right now, there's no intent to change anything in terms of the fee structure.\nTony Xu: Yes, James. And if I could, I'll just add a bit to this before heading into the DashMart question, which is -- I think one of the things I'm most proud of the team for accomplishing is that in the last 2.5 years, even though we stated in the shareholder letter, all of the growth that we've seen both top and bottom line in our business.  What I'm really proud of is that in achieving all of that for the platform, we've been able to increased earnings for Dashers, increased sales for merchants and reduced fees on a continued basis over the last 2.5 years for consumers. And so -- and DashPass certainly has been a big part of that on the consumer front. But we've really done this while improving the offerings for each of the audiences that we're lucky to serve. On the DashMart question, I think it's important to start with like what we're doing and why we're doing it. With DashMart, one of the things that we've been studying very closely is why do certain industries get penetrated? Or why do they move from offline to online? Obviously, the restaurant delivery industry, even though, again, it has a large runway for growth, it has reached a certain level of penetration that something, say, grocery delivery or retail delivery or delivery from other types of stores has only reached a fraction of. And one of the things that we've seen so far is that the setup for third-party delivery in a lot of these non-restaurant categories isn't really optimized for delivery. It's really optimized for going inside the store, for browsing. As a result, some of these stores don't even know exactly what's on the shelf. And as a result, what you see in sometimes third-party delivery is a product that is more expensive than what someone would pay inside the store. They don't always get exactly what they want when they actually buy it, and it doesn't always show up faster than a consumer can shop on their own. And as a result, you haven't seen that penetration. And so our belief is in addition to working with all of these fantastic partners who were really, really privileged to work with, whether it's Sprouts Farmers Markets or Giant Eagle or Loblaws or in retail categories, people like Dick's Sporting Goods or Sephora, is that we want to start by working with them to really understand how can we bring incremental demand right out of the gate, but we also want to invent the future of the industry. And we believe the future in the industry has to offer a product that is going to be -- give customers exactly what they expect when they order at around the same prices of what they pay in store and certainly with greater convenience than they could do it on their own. And so DashMart is really a part of that, and we're doing that in concert with all of these partners that we've been lucky to team up with. And we're doing that here in the United States, we're doing that overseas, and that's really what DashMart is. It's going to be a very important infrastructural component for the future. Now that said, just like with all investments at DoorDash, it's not just about the long-term strategy of how can we maximize long-term profit dollars. It's about how can we also invest with discipline according to the stage of the projects. And so that's what we're doing with DashMarts, too. It's not just what we're doing with the third-party business. We're doing that with DashMarts as well, making sure that we can achieve product market fit. Once we see that, we continue investing. And if we keep seeing that grow, we will continue to make those investments. And so far, we like what we see. But there's a long road ahead, right? We've just started the DashMart business really a couple of years ago. So we're learning very, very quickly, and we have to keep improving our product quality.\nJames Lee: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali. Your line is open. \nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions, please. First, maybe just looking at the P&L. Your market efficiency has gone up tremendously. I think in the last year, I think your sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue dropped by something like 1,000 basis points. So it's down not only on a percentage basis, but even on an absolute basis. I was wondering if you can kind of unpack that a little bit for us in terms of where is the efficiency coming from? Is it better ad rates? Is it maybe less spend on the U.S. restaurant category, where you obviously dominate? Maybe just kind of help us understand the drivers of that. And is that the primary driver for the higher EBITDA expectation for Q4? And second, on the Wolt, maybe just help us understand the acceleration in GOVs there. I think in the letter, you talked about customer acquisition at an all-time high, which is really impressive just all things considered. So maybe just help us understand, again, sustainability of that as we go forward and maybe specific countries where you're seeing such a huge performance. Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hey, Youssef, maybe I'll take both of those questions. And Tony, chime in if there's anything else to add. So first on the marketing efficiency point, I just want to go back to some of the comments that we had shared when we went public back in the S-1, which is once you've acquired a cohort and the cohort sort of gets into its second, third, fourth year of life, the marketing spend associated with that cohort declines. It declines materially, right? Because there is no \"marketing maintenance spend\" that's required. And so what that means is as our business gets larger and our base of existing consumers gets larger, that provides leverage in sales and marketing. Now more specifically, if you were to tear apart the sales and marketing line and look at CAC versus Dash acquisition cost versus marketing acquisition -- versus merchant acquisition costs. There is leverage on CAC, but particularly in '22 compared to '21, there's been a lot of leverage in terms of our Dash acquisition costs, and that's been driven by product improvements that we've made.  We're making it easier to Dash. Dashers are putting more hours into our platform. The retention of our fleet has gone up. And as a result, that means we need to acquire fewer Dashers to perform -- to actually to fulfill the deliveries that are happening on our platform. And so that's provided leverage in addition to the point I made about an increase in the existing base of consumers. So that's the response to your marketing efficiency question. When I -- on the Wolt question, it comes down to a couple of factors. I mean Wolt operates in markets that have 300 million people, right? And these markets are having low levels of penetration. In fact, even in the oldest markets, Wolt adoption levels are less than 10%. So there's a lot of room for growth just to expand customer acquisition in the markets in which they operate as well as expand to new cities in those countries in which they operate.  So that, coupled with the fact that the retention in the Wolt app is super high and order frequency continues to increase as the macro point that people like eating, people like the convenience of food delivery, and therefore, they only end up increasing the utilization of the product, the combination of these 2 things has helped them drive the results that you're seeing.\nYoussef Squali: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth. Your line is now open. \nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking questions. I just want to ask if you have any update to your commentary from last quarter, just suggesting a modest increase in '23 EBITDA. And then secondly, two things that come up a lot with investors, higher insurance costs and then also the regulatory environment just given the DOL ruling and Prop 22 status kind of still outstanding. So maybe you could comment on those.\nPrabir Adarkar: Sure. Maybe I'll start. And Tony, you can chime in whenever you want. So on the EBITDA point, so I think we said in our letter, we expect that the U.S. restaurant business will continue to grow in 2023 and will increase its contribution profit, both in dollar and margin tops, right? Historically, what's happened is we've taken the majority of those profits and we have reinvested them in these investment areas. We're at a point where these investment areas are getting -- exhibiting margin improvement, and so the investment dollars don't perfectly offset the increase in the contribution profit in the restaurant business, and that's going to create some flow-through impact to EBITDA. So the combination of these two things, which is increasing restaurant profit, coupled with margin improvement in the investment areas, will help us increase annual EBITDA, both in dollar and margin terms in 2023. The only caveat I'll make is we continue to remain in investment mode, and so I'll change this approach if we identify attractive growth opportunities. But today, at current trajectory and current portion speed, we expect to increase annual EBITDA. On your question on insurance, actually, when you look at our insurance cost in Q3 versus Q2, as a percentage of our GOV, our insurance costs were flat. So good progress in Q3. I won't declare a winner yet. We've got to watch this closely, but there's been no increase at least as a percentage in Q3 relative to Q2.\nTony Xu: Yes, Doug, and on the question regarding regulatory and what we're seeing, we're largely seeing pretty much exactly what we would have expected. I mean, I think just to make sure we're on the same fact basis with respect to, say, the DOL announcement that was made recently, it doesn't change our business model or reclassify drivers. And in many ways, just is an affirmation of President Obama's administration's determination that there are independent contractor workers out there. And that more broadly, they're largely quite supportive of this line of work. And so what we've seen is outside of a handful of cities, and it's been the same count of cities that have, I would say, frankly, perhaps abuse their power and are trying to overregulate the industry, by and large, I think lawmakers, regulators, anyone in policy that we've spoken to has been very productive in terms of making sure that we can serve Dashers together. I mean, again, let's remind everyone that what Dashers want. In terms of their activity, the average Dasher, and we're talking about 3 million Dashers every quarter, Dashers are working fewer than 4 hours a week on average, 90% of Dashers work fewer than 10 hours a week. This is in the United States. And so what they're saying with their feet is the number one thing they value about the DoorDash platform is really the flexibility that it offers. And then when you look at what they say and we look at -- take Proposition 22 as an example, Dashers preferred -- 87% of Dashers preferred staying as independent contractors. The vast majority of voters in California supported Proposition 22. And so I'm optimistic that regulators and policymakers will take this into account and actually reflect what Dashers want, which is that they'd like to see labor laws catch up candidly to the modern-day realities of what the future of work really is, which is people ought to be able to control where they work when they work, and that's really what we see. So we don't really expect any new changes versus what we've said before.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Doug, just to add to Tony's comments there. Obviously, in some cases, this regulation introduces new cost into the system. And our goal in such situations is to try to execute as efficiently as we can and try to optimize the way that cost. But in some situations, the cost might be onerous and cannot be entirely optimized away. And so we have a right and an expectation to able to generate a profit in the markets we operate in. And if those costs are overly onerous, we will act to protect our EBITDA guidance. And so I want to make sure that, that's clear.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Tony just on business philosophy and sort of risk management through different macro scenarios. The business is holding on great so far. But if we sort of walk into a scenario where in '23, you potentially have a weaker consumer in the U.S. or Europe and maybe your more cash flow generative U.S. business decelerates or has some impact from macro.  Can you just sort of put us in that world and talk to us about sort of your investment philosophy in both your more developed businesses as well as the earlier more developing products just to ensure you're best positioned to drive these industries post-recovery while also doing the best you can to sort of maintain and improve employee morale, which in part probably matters around the stock?\nTony Xu: Brian, yes, I mean, I think the investment philosophy has been largely consistent with what we've done. And I mean, I think even when I think about the last 10 quarters, basically from when we've become public to where we are now, what we outlined in the S-1, we've kind of just continued marching towards that drumbeat of telling the narrative of how we want to be the local commerce company, both building the largest local commerce marketplace, the largest local commerce platform and how we're making investments in towards doing that. I mean I think it's important to take note of what has happened in the last 2.5 years. I mean we went from a one business line company into now 5 businesses with investments into operations overseas outside of the restaurant category, an ads business, a platform business with products like Dress Drive and storefronts. And so when I think about what we are today, the biggest thing that I've been thinking a lot about is how do we actually make sure we continue to stay disciplined about investing commensurate to the stage of those projects. Now obviously, there's a lot of macro headwinds, as you mentioned, and that have changed in the past year. But for me, all that suggests is just it's going to put pressure on our execution. But obviously, if we're not -- if it puts pressure on the consumer, which is, I think, the point that you're going towards and we're not seeing signal in some of these investment areas, then we certainly would pull back and invest accordingly. And so for me, it's really, again, about keeping that discipline even though we've gone from one business now to five businesses. And just to also put things in perspective just for everyone on the line, a lot of the investment dollars are going into our non-U.S. and our non-restaurants category businesses. And the size of those investments now have built a business that's larger than all of DoorDash just a few years ago. And so we certainly like what we see. But obviously, if we're seeing behavior come down because of macro pressures, we will invest accordingly.\nPrabir Adarkar: And just to add to Tony's comments, Brian. I mean, remember, our core U.S. restaurant business is growing and generates significant cash flow. And historically, we've invested the vast majority of this to grow scale in these other areas, into new categories, in international. But these investments are discretionary. And that means that if for one reason or another, we're better served by pulling back on the investment because we're not seeing the right signal in terms of consumer demand, because we're not seeing the right improvement in terms of unit economics or whatever, we can alter the pace of the investment. So far, we've been pretty disciplined with capital allocation. You can see that now in the results in terms of the U.S. restaurant business, and the plan is to continue being equally disciplined going forward.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions, please. I know somebody already asked you about macro impact on the demand side. Anything you'd call out on the supply side? Anything about the need for extra side hustle that's maybe led to bring in more Dashers? And then secondly, Prabir, your comments about '23. We always parse your words very carefully. That last quarter, you had said the increased annual EBITDA by a modest amount. And this time, when finishing your answer to the question, just said you would increase annual EBITDA but you didn't use the modest word. Is there anything to read into that? Sorry to ask you such a precise question, but I just want to make sure we're not missing any nuances.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. Maybe I'll take both. So Mark, on the Dasher supply question, this is the point I made sort of through today's conversation around the labor market being more normalized this year than it was last year. And so that's having an impact on, obviously, to some degree, advertising rates but also in terms of supply that's available to become Dashers. And that benefit has been turbocharged by product improvements that have now improved the retention of the fleet and is actually generating incremental supply hours from existing Dashers. And so both of those things means you just don't have -- you don't need to acquire as many new Dasher. So the labor environment -- it's a long story short, the labor environment has resulted in all-in national costs being better today. And that's been -- and because of the product improvement that we've made, we expect that to continue benefiting our cost structure in Q4 as well as 2023, provided there's no shocks of the labor environment. On the question around 2023, I'd urge you not to overextrapolate on a word or 2. Really, we're not providing quantitative guidance. But what I am trying to share with you is when you think about the underlying dynamics of the business, the reason you didn't see a lot of EBITDA expansion going from '21 into '22 was because the pickup in terms of contribution profit from the U.S. restaurant business was largely soaked up by the investments. We're at a point right now where the investments are getting better from a margin perspective, while the U.S. business continues to grow and therefore throws off more dollars and as continuing improvements in the margins, and it's not a perfect offset anymore. It used to be, not anymore. And that's going to generate incremental EBITDA, both in dollar terms and in margin terms. We'll come back to you with specific guidance on 2023 in Q4, which is in line with our normal cadence.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Prabir.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Andy Hargreaves, I now turn the call back over to you.\nAndy Hargreaves: Great. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate both your time today and your support, and look forward to talking with many of you soon. Have a good evening.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Prabir Adarkar",
            "content": "Ross, it's Prabir. Just to add on to Tony's point. Look, in comparison to other areas of e-commerce, frankly, other consumer tech companies who have been fairly resilient, and I think that's a function of a couple of things, it's the stickiness of the category we operate in as well as the best-in-class retention with our product. Logically, there is some impact from macro, but that impact seems to be much more limited to less obituated, more occasional customers. DashPass on the other hand, is higher retentions we've talked about in the past, and the user behavior for DashPass continues to remain strong. And so all that to say that when you look at our consumer metrics in Q3 as well as now in October, consumer metrics continue to remain strong. Tony pointed to our monthly active users that have grown both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Order frequency has grown year-on-year. Pace of customer acquisition continues to remain strong. And all of that basically establishes a foundation for solid growth, not just in Q4, but into 2023, and that's what we're really seeing in the results. So that's the color that of macro.  On your question on the contribution margin, I think your specific question was why our 2022 incremental is higher than the average of 7%. 2021 was impacted by higher DashPass cost due to a more expensive labor market. Today, the labor market has normalized. But in addition, we've actually made certain product improvements that have enhanced the retention of our existing fleet of Dasher and also an incremental supply hours from each Dasher. And a combination of these two things, has actually led to a benefit in terms of Dasher all-in cost that includes cost per order as well as Dasher acquisition costs.  And so this benefit in Dasher costs in 2022 has led to higher incremental this year compared to the general average. Those product improvements will continue benefiting our cost structure. And so you see the impact of that, by the way, in our Q4 EBITDA guidance. And then on your question about other markets above 7% and so on and so forth, I just wanted to remind everyone on what we've said historically, which was we don't operate our business to a target margin, but rather we aim to maximize total profit dollars. And the objective we have in providing the incremental percentages as well as the progression and contribution profit through all -- through COVID, through COVID reopening, through Prop 22, through inflation and all these factors was really to provide proof points on our execution and to provide visibility into our margin trajectory going forward. And so practically, what that means is we will flex margins that increases total profit dollars. And just to add to Tony's comments, Bernie, let me share a couple of data points that give us excitement and conviction around these investments. The first point, which we've made in the past is these markets that were attempting to expand into, whether the new categories or international, these are large trillion-dollar market and even a few points of penetration in these large markets could add massive scale to our business. Second, we're seeing very strong signs of progress. And in some cases, we've been operating in these areas for less than a couple of years. Our new verticals, our convenience and grocery business is growing over 80% year-on-year. Our U.S. third-party grocery business is growing over 100% year-on-year, and that's significantly faster than other companies that operate in this space. Our international business is growing over 50% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. And you compare that to other European food delivery players that are showing single-digit year-on-year growth rate, and so our performance is a function of the fact that we've built a product that people like and keep coming back to, i.e., better retention and growing order frequency. And so we like what we see in terms of product market fit. This is exactly the thesis that we had laid out when we made these investments, a little investment in both or investments in our new categories, and they're playing out just as we had originally talked they would. Now in terms of profitability, we wouldn't do any of these things unless we believe there was a path to attractive unit economics. And as Tony alluded earlier, we measure these things regularly to ensure that the steady progress is being made towards steady-state economics. We're beginning to see early proof points, some of which we cited in the letter.  And third-party convenience, we expect to get to a variable profit breakeven by the end of this year. We had committed to this earlier on in the year, and we're on track to deliver on that commitment. And our third-party grocery business will continue to improve margins. Q3 margins are better than Q2. And so these are exciting proof points along the way. And if you look at what we have done in the U.S. restaurant business, which we've laid out in great detail in the shareholder letter, it's about repeating those playbooks in these other areas. It's not -- there's no single silver bullet. It's the exact same factors around improving the efficiency of deliveries, optimizing defect rates that ultimately will help these areas get to profitability just like the U.S. business did. And so we have a long way to go, but we continue to improve products. We continue to get more efficient. We believe we can drive outsized growth along with margin improvement. And just add one more comment to that, Deepak, which is I'll go back to my comment about the size of these markets. These are large trillion-dollar markets, where money can be made. And given a small amount of penetration in these markets, there's a lot of GMV that can convert our committee free cash flow. And so if you just pencil out the math in the scale of these opportunities and our success with execution historically, the ROI math will work. So to be honest, it what makes the math work is essentially the scale of these opportunities combined with our execution. On your question, regarding sort of the U.S. business and growth. I'll point you to a couple of things, which is it's easy to get stuck in the quarter-to-quarter sort of dynamic, and you've got third-party data providers that sometimes provide data with very little basis. But what I will say is the following, which is our level of penetration even in the U.S. remains small, whether it's a percentage of overall restaurant sales or a percentage of the population that are actually using DoorDash were a small portion of the overall opportunity, and we continue to grow. MAUs have continued to grow, which is a good sign. Even despite the fact that you've had restaurants reopening, cities reopening, people going back into the store, despite that and through that, our business has continued to grow. Whereas in other areas of e-commerce, we've actually seen the growth expectations been taken down. And what that points to is the fact that this is an enduring category. People eat. People eat regardless of what's happening to inflationary pressures and other things. They may modulate their behavior and adjust from which restaurants they're eating at or the number of items in their basket and so on, but they still eat. And you're seeing the resilience of that habit in our numbers. And so the opportunity as we look forward in order to continue increasing the size of the scale of the business is for us to make progress on the fundamentals, which is selection, quality and affordability. We talked about new categories. Part of the reason we're bringing on new categories is because it's a new use case for those people that perhaps don't want to use DoorDash for restaurants, they can now use it to get the flowers or get their convenience items or get their grocery items or get their liquor delivery.  And so a growing number of our new customers now are actually coming to DoorDash to try these new categories, and this is going to unlock the next leg of growth as we continue increasing our penetration of the U.S. population. So hopefully, that provides some perspective on how I think about growth on a go-forward basis. Yes. And just to add one data point to that, Eric. I mean if you just look at Wolt's performance, we were super proud of the team and what they've built. In Q3, they grew 60% year-on-year in euro terms. Now I can't think of an example of another European food delivery company that's going at those rates. And from what I've seen, they're growing single digits' year-on-year. So it's hard to sit here and say that Wolt is not gaining share just given the disparity in growth rates versus relying on third-party data and issues with their approaches and so on. So I rely on the absolute growth rate, which is, in my mind, a pretty reliable proof point around the fact that the Wolt team has created a product and experience that has higher retention, enables growing order frequency, and that's what's allowed them to produce the growth rates that they're posting. Thanks for the question, James. I'll take the first one and then Tony can talk with a second. Just as a general philosophy, we're trying to improve selection quality and affordability. And particularly in the third dimension, affordability means -- to us means reducing friction that's caused by consumer fees, whether it's through DashPass or the non-DashPass product. It's trying to reduce fees or commissions on merchants and increase Dasher earnings. So in our case, we don't need to increase DashPass rates as a way of making the unit economics work because even at their current rates, DashPass economics word fine even without taking into account the subscription fee. So I view an increase in subscription fee at DashPass as being something that would actually slow down the pace of DashPass adoption which we've been very happy with so far. It continues to remain the largest paid membership program in the food category. We hit record highs in terms of our dashboard subscribers. And the pace of growth in this program has frankly been consistent despite some of the partnerships that other competitors may have entered into or despite the bundled offerings that other competitors may be providing. I mean despite all of those things, we're seeing DashPass grow. So we like the way it's set up. We like the way it's position us for growth. And at least right now, there's no intent to change anything in terms of the fee structure. Hey, Youssef, maybe I'll take both of those questions. And Tony, chime in if there's anything else to add. So first on the marketing efficiency point, I just want to go back to some of the comments that we had shared when we went public back in the S-1, which is once you've acquired a cohort and the cohort sort of gets into its second, third, fourth year of life, the marketing spend associated with that cohort declines. It declines materially, right? Because there is no \"marketing maintenance spend\" that's required. And so what that means is as our business gets larger and our base of existing consumers gets larger, that provides leverage in sales and marketing. Now more specifically, if you were to tear apart the sales and marketing line and look at CAC versus Dash acquisition cost versus marketing acquisition -- versus merchant acquisition costs. There is leverage on CAC, but particularly in '22 compared to '21, there's been a lot of leverage in terms of our Dash acquisition costs, and that's been driven by product improvements that we've made.  We're making it easier to Dash. Dashers are putting more hours into our platform. The retention of our fleet has gone up. And as a result, that means we need to acquire fewer Dashers to perform -- to actually to fulfill the deliveries that are happening on our platform. And so that's provided leverage in addition to the point I made about an increase in the existing base of consumers. So that's the response to your marketing efficiency question. When I -- on the Wolt question, it comes down to a couple of factors. I mean Wolt operates in markets that have 300 million people, right? And these markets are having low levels of penetration. In fact, even in the oldest markets, Wolt adoption levels are less than 10%. So there's a lot of room for growth just to expand customer acquisition in the markets in which they operate as well as expand to new cities in those countries in which they operate.  So that, coupled with the fact that the retention in the Wolt app is super high and order frequency continues to increase as the macro point that people like eating, people like the convenience of food delivery, and therefore, they only end up increasing the utilization of the product, the combination of these 2 things has helped them drive the results that you're seeing. Sure. Maybe I'll start. And Tony, you can chime in whenever you want. So on the EBITDA point, so I think we said in our letter, we expect that the U.S. restaurant business will continue to grow in 2023 and will increase its contribution profit, both in dollar and margin tops, right? Historically, what's happened is we've taken the majority of those profits and we have reinvested them in these investment areas. We're at a point where these investment areas are getting -- exhibiting margin improvement, and so the investment dollars don't perfectly offset the increase in the contribution profit in the restaurant business, and that's going to create some flow-through impact to EBITDA. So the combination of these two things, which is increasing restaurant profit, coupled with margin improvement in the investment areas, will help us increase annual EBITDA, both in dollar and margin terms in 2023. The only caveat I'll make is we continue to remain in investment mode, and so I'll change this approach if we identify attractive growth opportunities. But today, at current trajectory and current portion speed, we expect to increase annual EBITDA. On your question on insurance, actually, when you look at our insurance cost in Q3 versus Q2, as a percentage of our GOV, our insurance costs were flat. So good progress in Q3. I won't declare a winner yet. We've got to watch this closely, but there's been no increase at least as a percentage in Q3 relative to Q2. And Doug, just to add to Tony's comments there. Obviously, in some cases, this regulation introduces new cost into the system. And our goal in such situations is to try to execute as efficiently as we can and try to optimize the way that cost. But in some situations, the cost might be onerous and cannot be entirely optimized away. And so we have a right and an expectation to able to generate a profit in the markets we operate in. And if those costs are overly onerous, we will act to protect our EBITDA guidance. And so I want to make sure that, that's clear. And just to add to Tony's comments, Brian. I mean, remember, our core U.S. restaurant business is growing and generates significant cash flow. And historically, we've invested the vast majority of this to grow scale in these other areas, into new categories, in international. But these investments are discretionary. And that means that if for one reason or another, we're better served by pulling back on the investment because we're not seeing the right signal in terms of consumer demand, because we're not seeing the right improvement in terms of unit economics or whatever, we can alter the pace of the investment. So far, we've been pretty disciplined with capital allocation. You can see that now in the results in terms of the U.S. restaurant business, and the plan is to continue being equally disciplined going forward. Yes. Maybe I'll take both. So Mark, on the Dasher supply question, this is the point I made sort of through today's conversation around the labor market being more normalized this year than it was last year. And so that's having an impact on, obviously, to some degree, advertising rates but also in terms of supply that's available to become Dashers. And that benefit has been turbocharged by product improvements that have now improved the retention of the fleet and is actually generating incremental supply hours from existing Dashers. And so both of those things means you just don't have -- you don't need to acquire as many new Dasher. So the labor environment -- it's a long story short, the labor environment has resulted in all-in national costs being better today. And that's been -- and because of the product improvement that we've made, we expect that to continue benefiting our cost structure in Q4 as well as 2023, provided there's no shocks of the labor environment. On the question around 2023, I'd urge you not to overextrapolate on a word or 2. Really, we're not providing quantitative guidance. But what I am trying to share with you is when you think about the underlying dynamics of the business, the reason you didn't see a lot of EBITDA expansion going from '21 into '22 was because the pickup in terms of contribution profit from the U.S. restaurant business was largely soaked up by the investments. We're at a point right now where the investments are getting better from a margin perspective, while the U.S. business continues to grow and therefore throws off more dollars and as continuing improvements in the margins, and it's not a perfect offset anymore. It used to be, not anymore. And that's going to generate incremental EBITDA, both in dollar terms and in margin terms. We'll come back to you with specific guidance on 2023 in Q4, which is in line with our normal cadence."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Hey, Ross, it's Tony. I'll start with the first one and answer briefly the second and hand it off to Prabir. On the first question, obviously, we've seen tremendous resilience in the business. In the U.S. business, you've seen continued growth north of 25% GOV, on the marketplace revenues north of 30% growth each -- for each of the last 5 quarters now. And on the flip side, this is in the face of an energy crisis, pretty sticky inflation and a war in Europe, and so it's sometimes hard to try to square the two. But I think the way that we've been thinking about things is really looking at it from a historical current day and future perspective. Historically, in the last 60 years in that time frame. Only two of the last 60 years have we seen a decline in food spend in the U.S., and that's specifically in the restaurant and grocery industries. And so I think even though all of us are wondering how to quantify the macro headwinds. Food is the most resilient category. I think historically, that's shown to be true. Current day, what we see in our own business is something largely the same. We also disclosed in the results that we saw our monthly active consumers grow, all-time highs in our DashPass membership program. And so what you're seeing is order rates of those who joined after the pandemic have largely resembled those who joined during the pandemic. Certainly, you see some softness and impact on the non-DashPass cohorts on a relative basis. But by and large, we're talking about extraordinarily similar types of ordering behavior. So that's what we see kind of currently. So on a go-forward basis, when I kind of square everything, I mean even as the market leader, sometimes it's hard to remember, but we're still less than 10% of the U.S. restaurant industry sales. When you look overseas, we're a much lower percentage than that. And so when I square, I think, the fundamentals, both in terms of the leading industry retention and order frequency in the U.S. business, the industry-leading retention order frequency in the European business, particularly with Volt, who grew at 60% on a euro basis, significantly faster than its peers, and then I square that strong fundamentals with the future potential and runway in these categories, I think that's why you're seeing the resilience as well as what was reflected in our guidance. On the second question, I think one of the things that -- and I'll let Prabir kind of talk about some of the details and specifics with respect to the contribution margin disclosure. But I think when I take a step back of what has happened in the last 2.5 years, obviously, there was a pandemic. There was a lot of changes in the macro climate as we've seen particularly '22 versus '21. We've seen regulatory pressures with the likes of Prop 22. And in spite of, I think, all of those ups, downs, sideways twist and turns, our business has grown fourfold the U.S. marketplace business. We've gained an extra 14 points of category share even as the market leader heading into the pandemic, and we've kind of extended that lead. And so I think I'm really proud of the team for being able to operate in such volatility. And so how did that happen? Well, I wish there was a silver bullet, but there really isn't. This is a business where you really have to be in the details. Every line item counts, every line item matters, every line item compounds, their interaction affects and dynamics in between the line items. And it's really measuring and managing all of these inches that, I think, has given us the compound interest and advantage that you've seen now accrue over the last 2.5 years. Yes. Maybe I can start. It's Tony, and then I'll hand it to Prabir on, I think, some of the numbers. I think it starts -- it's important to understand why we're investing in some of these categories. I mean the goal of DoorDash was always to build the largest local commerce marketplace and the largest local commerce platform in an effort to make sure that every physical business can be successful as they move into the digital economy. And our investments into both our non-restaurants category as well as our non-U.S. operations, I think, are really bearing fruit. If you looked at what has transpired in the last couple of years, we effectively have grown a business that was largely 0 in the non-restaurants category into several businesses of billions of dollars of GOV run rate with improving margin economics. And the third-party convenience business is a category leader as well as a variable profit breakeven. As one example, for instance, the earliest business that we started outside the restaurants category. Today, we have over 75,000 partners outside of restaurants, which is more than any other platform in North America, again, from almost a standing start a couple of years ago. And so the way we think about investing again is similar to what Prabir said to the last question around maximizing total long-term cash flow. And as we see projects, we invest according to what stage they're at. And so as long as we're seeing product market fit signals, we'll continue to invest. And if we don't, we'll pull back. Sure. Deepak, I'll take the first one. With respect to investing, frankly, in any environment, whether we're talking about a low interest rate environment or a high interest environment, we're obviously taking that as one input into how we make investments. But the primary input there's always going to be, are we investing appropriate to the stage of the project? I think it's just as easy to overinvest when \"times\" are good even though you're not seeing the signal that you want to see. And we've been very disciplined about that, whether it's been our entry into other countries or our foray into other categories beyond the restaurant category, our build-out of the advertising business. And then on the flip side, I think sometimes you cannot take enough risk, especially when you have a strong, robust, resilient business that gives you the cash flows to invest in some of these other categories. So from where I sit, certainly, we're taking that into account in terms of the cost of capital and making sure that we're operating with discipline, making sure that as we've grown tremendously the company over the last couple of years that we're as efficient as we were heading into the last couple of years. And that takes a lot of discipline, but it also takes a lot of intentional focus to make sure that we're not just investing in people, but we're investing in the systems to allow us to see operating leverage into the future. And so those are the things that we're doing to make sure that we're investing with discipline. But I would still say the primary input, especially as we look into some of these investments into newer areas, whether it's overseas or into other categories or into new business areas, it's really, are we investing appropriate to the stage of the project? Yes. Maybe I can start, Eric, and I'll let Prabir chime in here. I think the answer to both of those questions to that it's a very competitive industry out there. And I'm not sure that there's ever been a \"letdown\" in terms of competitive intensity. And that's because, at least from where I sit, I believe the highest form of competition is always growing, and that's really consumer expectations.  I think to me, whether we are the market leader or where we are not yet the market leader, it's really about an investment in product quality. Consumers are always going to expect more selection of stores they can order from, greater affordability, better quality of service and superior customer support. And to me, that really at the end of the day is what's going to rate limit our ability to penetrate the large runways that both Prabir and I have discussed, whether it's the restaurant industry, the grocery industry, the retail categories. And that's really what we see. But I wouldn't say that there's been lower competitive intensity in one form or another. I still think that the biggest challenge is making sure that we can get consumers to actually try the product. I also would say that with respect to maybe the premise in the second question, I think there's a common miss out there that Wolt is not a market leader in the majority of its markets when it actually is. And so I do think that some of this might just be where there's some unreliable third-party reporting. But what I would say is both the instruction I give to our U.S. teams or our teams overseas, it's making sure that we continue making sure to invest in the product quality so that we see gains in our retention and order frequency, which only leads us to compound that advantage over time, whether that's as the market leader or whether that's someone just entering the market. Yes, James. And if I could, I'll just add a bit to this before heading into the DashMart question, which is -- I think one of the things I'm most proud of the team for accomplishing is that in the last 2.5 years, even though we stated in the shareholder letter, all of the growth that we've seen both top and bottom line in our business.  What I'm really proud of is that in achieving all of that for the platform, we've been able to increased earnings for Dashers, increased sales for merchants and reduced fees on a continued basis over the last 2.5 years for consumers. And so -- and DashPass certainly has been a big part of that on the consumer front. But we've really done this while improving the offerings for each of the audiences that we're lucky to serve. On the DashMart question, I think it's important to start with like what we're doing and why we're doing it. With DashMart, one of the things that we've been studying very closely is why do certain industries get penetrated? Or why do they move from offline to online? Obviously, the restaurant delivery industry, even though, again, it has a large runway for growth, it has reached a certain level of penetration that something, say, grocery delivery or retail delivery or delivery from other types of stores has only reached a fraction of. And one of the things that we've seen so far is that the setup for third-party delivery in a lot of these non-restaurant categories isn't really optimized for delivery. It's really optimized for going inside the store, for browsing. As a result, some of these stores don't even know exactly what's on the shelf. And as a result, what you see in sometimes third-party delivery is a product that is more expensive than what someone would pay inside the store. They don't always get exactly what they want when they actually buy it, and it doesn't always show up faster than a consumer can shop on their own. And as a result, you haven't seen that penetration. And so our belief is in addition to working with all of these fantastic partners who were really, really privileged to work with, whether it's Sprouts Farmers Markets or Giant Eagle or Loblaws or in retail categories, people like Dick's Sporting Goods or Sephora, is that we want to start by working with them to really understand how can we bring incremental demand right out of the gate, but we also want to invent the future of the industry. And we believe the future in the industry has to offer a product that is going to be -- give customers exactly what they expect when they order at around the same prices of what they pay in store and certainly with greater convenience than they could do it on their own. And so DashMart is really a part of that, and we're doing that in concert with all of these partners that we've been lucky to team up with. And we're doing that here in the United States, we're doing that overseas, and that's really what DashMart is. It's going to be a very important infrastructural component for the future. Now that said, just like with all investments at DoorDash, it's not just about the long-term strategy of how can we maximize long-term profit dollars. It's about how can we also invest with discipline according to the stage of the projects. And so that's what we're doing with DashMarts, too. It's not just what we're doing with the third-party business. We're doing that with DashMarts as well, making sure that we can achieve product market fit. Once we see that, we continue investing. And if we keep seeing that grow, we will continue to make those investments. And so far, we like what we see. But there's a long road ahead, right? We've just started the DashMart business really a couple of years ago. So we're learning very, very quickly, and we have to keep improving our product quality. Yes, Doug, and on the question regarding regulatory and what we're seeing, we're largely seeing pretty much exactly what we would have expected. I mean, I think just to make sure we're on the same fact basis with respect to, say, the DOL announcement that was made recently, it doesn't change our business model or reclassify drivers. And in many ways, just is an affirmation of President Obama's administration's determination that there are independent contractor workers out there. And that more broadly, they're largely quite supportive of this line of work. And so what we've seen is outside of a handful of cities, and it's been the same count of cities that have, I would say, frankly, perhaps abuse their power and are trying to overregulate the industry, by and large, I think lawmakers, regulators, anyone in policy that we've spoken to has been very productive in terms of making sure that we can serve Dashers together. I mean, again, let's remind everyone that what Dashers want. In terms of their activity, the average Dasher, and we're talking about 3 million Dashers every quarter, Dashers are working fewer than 4 hours a week on average, 90% of Dashers work fewer than 10 hours a week. This is in the United States. And so what they're saying with their feet is the number one thing they value about the DoorDash platform is really the flexibility that it offers. And then when you look at what they say and we look at -- take Proposition 22 as an example, Dashers preferred -- 87% of Dashers preferred staying as independent contractors. The vast majority of voters in California supported Proposition 22. And so I'm optimistic that regulators and policymakers will take this into account and actually reflect what Dashers want, which is that they'd like to see labor laws catch up candidly to the modern-day realities of what the future of work really is, which is people ought to be able to control where they work when they work, and that's really what we see. So we don't really expect any new changes versus what we've said before. Brian, yes, I mean, I think the investment philosophy has been largely consistent with what we've done. And I mean, I think even when I think about the last 10 quarters, basically from when we've become public to where we are now, what we outlined in the S-1, we've kind of just continued marching towards that drumbeat of telling the narrative of how we want to be the local commerce company, both building the largest local commerce marketplace, the largest local commerce platform and how we're making investments in towards doing that. I mean I think it's important to take note of what has happened in the last 2.5 years. I mean we went from a one business line company into now 5 businesses with investments into operations overseas outside of the restaurant category, an ads business, a platform business with products like Dress Drive and storefronts. And so when I think about what we are today, the biggest thing that I've been thinking a lot about is how do we actually make sure we continue to stay disciplined about investing commensurate to the stage of those projects. Now obviously, there's a lot of macro headwinds, as you mentioned, and that have changed in the past year. But for me, all that suggests is just it's going to put pressure on our execution. But obviously, if we're not -- if it puts pressure on the consumer, which is, I think, the point that you're going towards and we're not seeing signal in some of these investment areas, then we certainly would pull back and invest accordingly. And so for me, it's really, again, about keeping that discipline even though we've gone from one business now to five businesses. And just to also put things in perspective just for everyone on the line, a lot of the investment dollars are going into our non-U.S. and our non-restaurants category businesses. And the size of those investments now have built a business that's larger than all of DoorDash just a few years ago. And so we certainly like what we see. But obviously, if we're seeing behavior come down because of macro pressures, we will invest accordingly."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to hand over to Andy Hargraves, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Andy, please begin your call.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thank you very much. Good afternoon and thanks, everybody for joining us on our second quarter of 2022 earnings call. I'm pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair, and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar.  We'll be making forward-looking statements during today's call, including our expectations of our business and the Wolt business following on our acquisition, the macroeconomic environment, financial position, and operating performance, our market and local commerce opportunity, future financial results and guidance, our strategy with investment approach. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described and some risks are described in our risk factors including in our SEC filings, including Form 10-K and 10-Q. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. information regarding our non-GAAP financial results including a reconciliation of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our investor letter, which is available on our IR website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our IR website. An audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. As in previous quarters, we'll go straight to questions. So with that, operator, please go ahead and take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one for Tony and one for Prabir. Tony, given the state of the market and kind of competition, it feels like at least some levels of incentives has come out of the system. Now, maybe perhaps from smaller players and kind of niche categories. Can you talk about whether you're seeing any benefits from favorable operating environment, either on frequency or kind of, customer acquisition right now? And then maybe Prabir, I know, you don't want a guide for 2023 specifically yet, but maybe how should we think conceptually about the 2023 EBITDA band? As your profit ports become larger, do you still see kind of big investment areas that would maybe keep the profit bands at these levels? Or can it gradually [indiscernible]? Thank you so much.\nTony Xu: Hey, Deepak its Tony. Yes, look on the first question our business has been always very competitive, ever since we founded the company nine years ago. And I think that what's been very impressive to us is just how resilient our business has been, both in light of competitive activities, both recent, and in the years that we've been building DoorDash as well as just the macro environment. As you know, we do see some consumer spending softening, but largely, we've been not impacted by that downward pressure. I really think that you see a lot of kind of the premise of your question reflected in our results. I mean, this is a quarter in which we beat topline, as well as in bottom-line, we grew results 25% GOV year-on-year. And we beat quite handily on the bottom-line, as well. And this is on top of a lot of the types of things that we're investing in. One that I will call out is that while we're not seeing any elevated pressures from certain types of incentives from competitors, what we are doing is we are taking care of our audiences. We invested over $40 million alone in the second quarter just to make sure that the Dashers, who are on the road, doing the hard work, can keep the profits that they expect to keep given some of the rising costs with fuel. And so, we're not seeing any of the elevated pressures we're seeing fairly normal activity on that side. And I think as a result, given our industry leading retention and order frequency, you continue to see our growth and our share gains.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Deepak on your second question around 2023, we're not providing quantitative 2023 guidance today, we will provide 2023 guidance when we report Q4, which is on a normal cycle, but I will provide some sort of thematic context. The first thing I'll say is going into 2023, we do expect our core U.S. restaurant business to grow and increase its contribution profit. At current course and speed, we plan to increase annually EBITDA by a modest amount. Now, note that this is after absorbing a full year of Wolt. So, said definitely core DoorDash ex-Wolt will expand a bit into 2023, even though the consolidated EBITDA won't grow meaningfully. And the only caveat we'll make to this is this could change if we identify attractive growth opportunities. We continue to remain in investment mode and look for these opportunities that benefit or retention order frequency, but at current course and speed, we would expect annual EBITDA to grow by a modest amount.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Okay. Thanks, Tony. Thanks Prabir.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I can. In the letter, you guys talked about being logistics-led marketplace. I guess how much room do you all see over the next few years to reduce cost per order? What are some of the key drivers to kind of get there and like where's the lowest hanging fruit? And then second one would just be you've talked in the past about how you don't try to beat EBITDA, you really try to kind of come in in the range. And if you beat it, it's because there just weren't attractive investment opportunities, like it was -- was there like something changing in the marketing landscape or any reason you guys let it flows through or just a function of some of the, kind of, inflation coming through as a surprise and you didn't have time to reinvest? If anything you can share there, it'd be great. Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yes. Hey, Lloyd, it's Tony, I'll take the first question and maybe Prabir can take the second part of the question. With respect to efficiency gains from logistics, I think this has been a hallmark of the DoorDash story and also, the Wolt story now that we've officially closed that partnership, in which if you think about the game that we're playing, or the business that we're in, we're really in the game of building a minimum efficient scale business. That's the type of business when you're talking about a hyperlocal business where order density is the most important metric. And in order to achieve that, you kind of have to do two things. One of the things you talked about in your question, which is really around high quality logistics efficiency, and the other is high quality, retention and order behavior from customers, without discounting, and that sort of activity. And DoorDash has really achieved both. And on the part around getting extra logistics efficiency, we continue to find areas of opportunity. I mean, we've certainly been leaders in our space, up to this point. But I still see massive room to keep increasing the selection on our platform and improve the logistics quality on our platform, the affordability of our service, and certainly our customer service levels. On logistics, more specifically, whether it's working on efficiency improvements at the store, as well as how we think about how we ought assign orders, especially now that we're entering multiple categories of deliveries, in addition to restaurant deliveries, I think there's a long room to go. And we're seeing that both in our numbers -- in the most recent quarter, as well as in the quarters leading up to this point.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Lloyd on the second part of your question, first I'll talk about Q2, and then I'll talk about some general philosophy. In terms of the Q2 performance and EBITDA, it was really a matter of two factors. The first was subtotals. As we described in the letter, as a result of consumer price inflation, our subtotals were higher because of higher item prices. And that then translates into higher commission dollars as well as high service fees, both of which benefit revenue and drop through to EBITDA. So, that's what drove the upside in Q2 in terms of EBITDA, In terms of general philosophy, I'll say our EBITDA is a function of really two things. First, it's the margin expansion that we continue to drive in our U.S. restaurant business. That's one thing. The second is the level of investment we make, which is discretionary, by the way below investment we make in our new verticals and in our international businesses. That level of investment varies from quarter-to-quarter based on the signals we see. And you can see that volatility in our historical trends where some quarters will produce more EBITDA than others because depending on what we see, in terms of retention all the frequency, we might invest more or less. And so our EBITDA range is really meant as a guiderail. But when we land within that range base, depending on the level of investment.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much, guys. Congrats on a really impressive quarter all things considered. My question is around the Wolt contribution. Can you maybe speak to the contribution that you're making in into the 2022 top and bottom-line? How to think about growth there considering kind of what's going on in Europe? And just broadly speaking, maybe Tony, can you address the issue about -- how do you kind, of take relatively subscale business in Europe that's across multiple geographies, and kind of grow it meaningfully for it to become a big part of the business? Your position to U.S. has been quite the opposite. You've been market leader, market dominant and in the single market. So, any help there would be great. Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Maybe I'll start and then Tony can chime in. I mean, the Wolt business goals 30% year-on-year, and that's in stark contrast to what we've seen with other companies that operate in a similar geographic region. And really, it all comes back down to two things is the fundamentals of the business in terms of its industry leading retention and growing order frequency. And we've seen it as long as you create a product that has high retention or the frequency, it ultimately translates into better growth, because you're retaining your customers better and that benefit compounds versus alternatives, when you end up losing customers because of poor retention. And where we're at in terms of the investment cycle, the bull markets are relatively new, both in terms of merchant adoption, as well as user adoption, as an example, even in its oldest market, adoption levels are less than 10% of the population, that test drive, there's a lot of room to grow, just as you grow your footprint within these countries, as well as you grows merchants selection, and grow the consumer base. And so that's driving investment we're making and we'll continue investing, as long as we see strong signal on retention and all the frequency.\nTony Xu: Yes, and on the second part of the question, I think it's important to start with maybe some historical context, and go down memory lane, not just, just a few years ago, DoorDash was certainly not the market leader and DoorDash, especially, five, six years ago was quite capital-constrained relative to any of its peers by a pretty far margin. And so, how was it possible that a, 'subscale company' was able to rise to market leadership, while it really was mastering the order level execution of the business, and again, you know, this is a hyperlocal business for order density, and achieving minimum efficient scale, through leading a retention order frequency, which is really, you know, measured in whether or not you build a superior product of selection, quality prices, and service. And then on the other end, whether or not you have the most capital efficient logistics operations, and I think when I look at the elements that cause DoorDash, to rise to market leadership, I find very similar kinds of characteristics and the Wolt business, which is what excited us about their business, not only today, as Prabir mentioned, far outgrowing some of their European peers. But maybe much more excited, are we in their potential, because when I compare the foundation of what they've built, and I look at, you know, the opportunity ahead of them, I mean, even in their oldest markets, bolt is less than 10% penetrated. On a global basis, both DoorDash and Wolt in our non-U.S. markets are less than 5% of restaurant sales, and outside of restaurants, less than 1% of non-food spend. And so when I compare the foundation that bolt has built on one hand, and on the other hand, compare it to the opportunity head, it's exactly what Prabir said, which is that it's absolutely the right time to invest. And I think you already see evidence of this as Wolt has become a market leader in many of their markets already.\nYoussef Squali: That's great. Thank you. And Prabir did you quantify the contribution to the $51 billion to $53 billion in GOV from Wolt?\nPrabir Adarkar: Well, we don't break out the guidance between Wolt and DoorDash. But when we do report earnings, you will split out organic versus OLS contribution.\nYoussef Squali: Got it. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan from Needham. Your line is open.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. We've noticed a lot of groceries in the marketplace doing delivery and online ordering in house in addition to being opened up to third-party marketplaces like yourself, so they're a competitor, but also a partner. Can you talk about some of the advantages that you have for customer acquisition and retention relative to them? And then also, with the 50% growth? And will this past quarter for GOV, 50% higher probably than some of the other European delivery operators? Can you just remind us whether it's market growth or just pure market share gains in terms of what's driving this growth?\nTony Xu: Sure. Maybe I'll take the first question. And I'll let Prabir take the second question. So, I'm not sure if this touches exactly the spirit of your question. But we view all merchants including grocers, as partners, maybe think about the mission of the company, the mission of the company is to, on one hand, build the largest local commerce marketplace, where we're driving incremental demand to all of these retailers, whether they be restaurants, grocers, convenience stores, other types of retail stores. And then on the other hand, build the largest local commerce platform where we give the tools whether it's logistics as a service in the form of DoorDash Drive, or ordering as a service in the form of DoorDash Storefront to all of these retailers so that they can build their own digital operations. So, we really view in equal parts, our mission to help grow on one hand, which is to bring that incremental demand and on the other hand, empower them to do it on their own. In fact, we see these customers on these different channels to be quite different. I mean if you think about it if a customer is quite used to and knows exactly what they want to order from a particular retailer, it probably makes quite a lot of sense for them on that occasion to actually order directly from the retailer. But on -- the greatest privilege that we have in this business is that people eat 20 to 25 times a week. And they shop even more times than that on top of that when you consider their non-food spend. And so for other occasions, maybe when they're not exactly sure what it is that they're looking for, but they want to buy something from the neighborhood, that's where the DoorDash Marketplace really comes in hand. And so we really view the retailer, the merchants, whether it's a grocer or other type of store, as our partner, and we have two ways in which we help them.\nPrabir Adarkar: And Bernie, on your second question around Wolt's growth, it's really driven by two things, it's MAU growth that was aided by some customer acquisition, but also by just by higher retention compared to the other players in the market. And then second order frequency growth, as Board brings on more selection both in the restaurant as well as the non-restaurant category, we're seeing some of the same things, as you saw in the U.S. where order frequency at a cohort level has continued to grow. And both of those things, particularly in the face of some of the more extreme COVID reversion that you saw in Europe, have led to the 50% year-on-year growth that they've decided.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I have two. Just the -- the first one -- the gross margins in the quarter were a little weaker than we thought at least. Could you just sort of talk to us about some of the put some takes on gross margins of the business? And how should we think about the gross margins of the business sort of going into the into the back half and maybe even longer term 2023? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hey, Brian, it's Prabir. So, let me let me start on both of your questions. So, first, our cost of sales increase that we saw on a year-on-year basis was only driven by two things, DashMart and insurance costs on DashMarts, as we've launched more and more DashMarts, the cost associated with those orders impacts cost of sales. So, roughly half of the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of GOV is driven by DashMarts. The other half roughly is driven by an increase in insurance costs, which was in line with our expectations, pointed to our comments from last quarter, where we said we experienced an increase in insurance reserves due to the outsized have been backed up a few large games. And we began to take actions on -- to improve the safety on our platform starting last quarter. But it takes a while for these changes to reflect on our claims data. And so as we previously discussed, we expect insurance costs to increase in the near-term. On the whole -- both the DashMarts cost increases as well as insurance cost is reflected in the guidance we provided. And so it's not incremental to the guidance, it's already reflected in there. In terms of gross margin for Wolt, here Wolt is combination of as I view it, so three distinct pieces. There's investments that are going into Japan and Germany. These are brand new market that we launched less than two years ago. Well, to get the flywheel going in terms of selection and quality and price. You've got investments in both market which is the equivalent of our DashMarts Wolt's first party distribution business, and then you've got the rest what I call core food delivery. Core food delivery is at consistent increase in gross margin levels and as we continue driving efficiency and order density, the local level, you start seeing the same type of efficiency in terms of Dasher cost kick in to produce increasing levels of gross margin. Japan and Germany both markets remain in investment mode and we continue to work on coverage, selection, quality and price there.\nBrian Nowak: That's very helpful. Thanks Prabir.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. First, Tony, I know you're talking a lot in the shareholder letter about not seeing anything yet on the consumer spending behavior patterns. But I think one of the questions we all get a lot from investors is you're seeing some large companies already say how they would run their business differently if the consumer spending environment did change? Is there any sense you can give us of how you're sort of game planning out different economic scenarios for the business? And how you might change investment philosophies or growth philosophies for the company if you did hit a rougher patch in terms of consumer spending and went through the platform? And then maybe additional question on grocery and convenience at some of the new categories. Can you give us a little bit of sense of folks who use multiple products across the platform, what that might mean in terms of LTV or how you're thinking about leaning in and promoting different category expansion on a per customer basis, what that might do for the unit economics, longer term? Thanks so much.\nPrabir Adarkar: Hey Eric, it's Prabir. Maybe I'll start with the first one around how we're going to manage the business and EBITDA impact of growth and Tony can talk about the impact from some of the new categories. So, maybe the first place to start is our core U.S. restaurant business is growing and continues to generate significant cash flow. And historically, we've taken that cash flow and invested the vast majority of it in order to grow and scale in these large and underpenetrated categories in which we operate. Again, as I said earlier, these investments are discretionary and so that means, the reason we're investing is because we continue to see strong signals of product market fit, as well as improving unit economics. Just to give you an example, if I -- on any given day, if I look at the top 10 stores on DoorDash in terms of sales, DashMart shows up, and that's a strong signal of product market fit. To the extent that we don't see continued improvements in terms of unit economics or continued improvements, retention or frequency, we will alter the pace of our investment. We've been very disciplined in terms of capital allocation so far, and we'll continue to do so going forward.\nTony Xu: Yes, and I think, if there's -- I'll add a little bit in terms of just my view on, the macro environment. And then and then I'll hit your second question about, the multi-category customer. So, obviously, we've been looking right, in terms of how the tough macroeconomic headwinds that, I think is hitting a lot of industries, how that might apply to us. We've been searching for this for many quarters now. And I think so far, the reason why largely we've been less impacted is because well, one, you know, our product is dynamic, it's been constantly improving. If you look at selection, for instance, in the 12 months, leading up to the end of the second quarter, we've added 80,000, net new stores onto the platform, we've made improvements to many quality metrics, in terms of our delivery experiences, whether it's speed, or accuracy, and other types of improvements, we've made many improvements to the shopping experience to lower the friction for consumers. And so I think that's one point. The second point is, I think we still have to remember that relative, especially to other maybe categories of commerce, or E commerce, we are still very early in our penetration, you know, even as the market leader just take the U.S. as one example, we're less than 8% of total restaurant industry sales. And we compare that to other categories of commerce, it is much earlier in its evolution. And then the final thing I would just add is just if you study macro -- as we've been looking at macroeconomics, I think there's only been a couple years in history in which food spend has actually declined due to challenging macroeconomic pressures. And I think that's just because it is less of a discretionary spend relative to other categories of spend. But that's said, to Prabir's point we're equal opportunity, growth investors that are very disciplined, you know, DoorDash, historically hasn't had a lot of resources. And so we take very seriously every dollar of spending, and as you saw in the second quarter, if we don't think that there's a great investment to be made over the same time period to generate a great return, we're not going to make that investment. And so that's true with all new projects, that's true with marketing investments, that's true with engineering and product investments. That's true with headcount, that's really true for every line item in the P&L. All right. Moving on to your second question, which I think was about the impact of consumer shopping in multiple categories? Well, one, this is just part of the mission of the company is to make sure we bring everything inside the neighborhood and not just from restaurants. And two, the last disclosure we made was -- I think, in the fourth quarter, we said that about 14% of our customers are now shopping in these non-restaurant categories, and we are seeing higher retention order frequency activity from these customers who are, who are engaging in multiple categories. And I think this makes quite a lot of sense as we're solving now different jobs and tasks for the customer. But that said, look, we still have to earn every inch. We have a long ways to go in terms of the product experience in each one of these categories, before we'd be satisfied with that behavior.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Boone: Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I know you guys talked earlier about the logistics benefits that you guys are running through the platform. But can you double click on the drivers of Dasher cost savings you guys highlighted in the letter? And then we haven't talked about Drive in a while? Can you provide an update there? Is there any change that you're seeing in terms of enterprise adoption now that we're kind of beyond peak COVID? Thanks so much.\nPrabir Adarkar : Andrew, maybe I'll start with the Dasher cost question, and then Tony can take the one on our platform services. So in terms of Dasher cost, I mean, at the end of the day, there's multiple components of this, including, as Tony alluded to earlier, how stores operations, in terms of how quickly they get the Dasher in and out. So there's opportunities to continue optimizing that, there's opportunities to continue dispatching from closer and closer Dashers which, by the way, as the density of your network increases, as you get more orders occurring within a certain neighborhood, within a certain store, you've got the ability to not just batch, but you've got the ability to get the Dasher to the store quicker than you otherwise might have. And so there's really -- if you think about the sources of opportunities, really reducing the amount of time it takes for a Dasher to get to the store, and reducing the amount of time that the Dasher spends in the store. And we continue to work both those levers and that's what's resulted in the improvement in terms of Dasher cost that we're seeing. The second thing I'll say, which is really just to clarify, last year was anomalous in terms of Dasher cost, because we were operating in a very expensive labor environment that was fueled by fiscal stimulus. So, in some ways, Dasher cost this year just -- at least my mind, normalizing back to historical levels versus ending incremental. So last year was elevated, this year isn\u2019t.\nTony Xu : Yes. And with respect to the second question around our platform service products, such as Drive, we see continued excitement for the stores, but I mean, in many ways our platform services business experiences similar seasonality is our marketplace business versus the second and third quarters are generally more muted in activity. And that's mostly because as you know, customers are back out, many of whom are taking advantage of the good weather, as well as perhaps last vacations from the beginning of two years of COVID. And now eating out again, or visiting retail stores again, that -- these stores have to make sure that their in-store activity is protected and taken care of, and that customer service levels are exceptional, before they invest aggressively in their off-premise business. So while there's some seasonal kinds of activity happening in that business. I think the COVID highs in terms of the excitement to invest in continue to accelerate the momentum behind e-commerce for all of these retailers, across any category remains just as high as ever. And so that's something that we expect to continue to help grow our platform services business, whether they're large merchants, like some of the ones you mentioned, who participate with products like DoorDash Drive or smaller merchants that really need help getting online for the first time and growing their kind of same-store sales off-premise with products like DoorDash Storefront. And so our focus right now is making sure that those products can be easier to use and that we can build products to help teach the playbooks that we've used to build a successful digital marketplace in our own right, such that these businesses can do it on their own.\nAndrew Boone: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi. Your line is open. \nRon Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two please. The chart in the note and letter that talks about existing consumer order rates, 2022 is trending higher than previous years and suggesting that these users in 2022 are more engaged. I\u2019m sure, can you just talk about the drivers here as a greater repeat rates, adoption newer verticals impacted DashPass, I'm sure it's all the above. And so maybe the bigger question is just, are these newer users, these newer cohort of users talking about how that compares to the prior cohorts? Are they just doing more? And then maybe, Prabir, as a quick follow-up, you mentioned just a strong cash flow generated from the US restaurant business, any way to provide some guideposts or insight in terms of that profitability to that US restaurant business? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar : Hey, Ron. So on -- let me start with the second first. On the US restaurant profitability, we're not actually -- we haven't provided any disclosure to break that out other than to say that continues generating more contribution profit and has improved both in terms of its net revenue margins, as well as its contribution profit as a percentage of GOV on a year-on-year basis. So we're happy with the progress there. And as we've said previously, it's a valuable funding source that we use to make investments in these new categories that were growing. In terms of your question around the order rate chart, really by the way the purpose of that chart was to demonstrate the fact that the order rate trends were similar to what we've seen historically. And to make the point that increase inflation, as well as potentially weakening consumer spending has not had an adverse impact relative to old cohorts. And so it's hard for us to untangle the impact of consumer spending from ordinary core seasonality. But taking a step back in terms of the 2022 cohorts, we're happy with the quality so far. Remember, we run our sales and marketing to a payback period, we've been operating within the same payback period for quite some time now. And so what's driving that is not just enhanced order frequency, which has continued growing on a year-on-year basis, as a result of improvements in selection, quality and price as well as the new categories that we\u2019re adding, but also improvements in terms of the core margin structure of the product. And so the core product has gotten more profitable in part due to subtotals. But also, in part because of improvements in terms of Dasher cost, the quality of our orders, which improves our customer support costs and so on. And that coupled with the order frequency is contributed to better LTVs and probably the same payback.\nRon Josey : Thanks Prabir. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler : Hey, guys. Two for me. Prabir, the 30% retention stat for Wolt. Is that comparable to the 48% for core DoorDash? I know they don't have a subscription business built out yet. And some of their markets are a little bit younger. So could you just walk us through that? And how does that 30 compare it to some of the EU competitors that they face in their home markets? And do you think the gap is as wide between that 30 and the competition as it is between the 48 and your US competition? Then the second question is just you guys give a good overview of how the consumer is holding up. I'm just curious as the frequency for DashPass kind of standalone holding up as well as non-DashPass and others a mix shift towards DashPass, which is driving up frequency. But could you just talk about those two kind of separately? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar : Yes. Ross, maybe I'll start and Tony can chime in. So first, on the 30% retention, I'm not sure what the 48% is that you're referring to. The 30% is month 12 retention. And if you actually compare that to DoorDash versus Wolt and apples-to-apples basis, it's pretty comparable in some markets is even higher. So we feel good about the retention stats when you compared to our data. And when you look at our data using third-party sources, we understand that our retention is better than everybody else in the category. In terms of the European competitors, there isn't an exact apples-to-apples source where that compares market-to-market based on what we're seeing in terms of competitors in the UK and other markets that are covered, the 30% actually compares very favorably. On the question of DashPass, DashPass frequency as well as order frequency of classic product, you really need to look at it on a cohort level. Yes, you've got mix shift between as you get more DashPass subscribers, the blended order frequency grows. But even on a cohort level, the underlying order frequency has continued to grow. And what's driving that is these new categories. We're seeing people adopt new categories, Tony referred to the 14% adoption rate at the end of Q4, which has continued to grow in Q1 and Q2 and that's driving order frequency and frequency growth at the cohort levels.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. \nJason Helfstein : Thanks. I just want to dig a bit more into DashPass, with the economy reopening and kind of return to work progressing in a certain direction and increased use of ride sharing? Is it making it customer acquisition of DashPass any less efficient or more challenging? And then secondly, I think you said that you point out Dasher costs are down this year versus last year, but specifically in perhaps this month and last month, are you seeing the cost to acquire new Dashers come down even any further? Thank you\nTony Xu: Yes, Jason. So first on the DashPass front, what I should say is we've not observed any impact on our DashPass signups as a result of people going back to the office and increases ride sharing or anything like that, in fact, our DashPass subject has continued to grow both on the year-on-year basis, as well as quarter-on-quarter basis to record highs. So we feel good that DashPass is a key component of driving better affordability for consumers, and the growth has been consistent and reliable. So that's great. In terms of Dasher costs, the reduction in Dasher costs was really driven by two things. There's the Dasher cost per order, which I mentioned earlier was really a normalization from the elevated levels last year, because of increased fiscal stimulus. There also was, if you recall last year increased advertising costs because everyone is competing for Dashers and that environment has gotten a little bit better, which has driven lower Dashers costs in Q2, and those dasher costs continue to remain where they were in the last couple of months of the quarter.\nJason Helfstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking question. I just wanted to circle back on profitability and just the EBITDA guide for the full year. Should we think about the increase at the low end there. Should we think about that as the same dynamics that you suggested in 2Q in terms of driven mostly by inflation? And is that all coming on the Dash side of the business? Or is -- are we seeing any improvement perhaps in your outlook there for Wolt? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Doug, can you clarify, are you talking about Q3 or Q4?\nDouglas Anmuth: The full year outlook for EBITDA.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yeah. The full year outlook of EBITDA, I mean, we're bringing it up because we've made progress here in the business both in terms of overall scale has increased relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year. If you remember our guidance at the beginning of the year was -- I think it was 49 million to 50 million at the top end. So that's gone up. Second, we are seeing positive benefits in terms of sub totals, which we talked about earlier, which results in more revenue and EBITDA. Third, Dasher costs are trending slightly better and that's been driven by two things as product changes that have helped drive increased retention of our Dashers as well as some of the macro factors such as rising cost of living and declining consumer savings that are helping increase the retention of our existing fleet. So it's these various factors that have given us a little more confidence on EBITDA, as a result of which, we have increased the low end of our guidance. And it's really a commitment to say that, we're going to stay above breakeven.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani. Your line is open.\nNikhil Devnani: Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the Q3 guide, if we take Wolt out, it looks like GOV is set to kind of step down sequentially for core DoorDash. Just wondering if you get there with the assumption that the July trends kind of hold roughly flattish through the quarter? Or is there some further kind of softness embedded in that outlook? And then as a second question, just given all the macro concerns, have you seen any indications that consumers are trading down here in the types of restaurants that they order from? And any kind of color you can provide on the demographics of the customer base would be helpful. Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Sure. Maybe I'll take a crack at that. So the first thing I'd say is our consumer metrics remain healthy. So if you look at what happened in Q2, our MAUs grew by double digits year-on-year, order frequency grew, our pace of consumer acquisition continued to remain healthy. And these signals provide a solid foundation for growth in the long term. With respect to the second half specifically, we expect normal course seasonality this year. So in general, we've experienced growth in Q4 and Q1. Sequential growth in Q2 and Q3 is usually muted as a result of summer seasonality. In fact, if you look at our Q2 to Q3 growth last year, you'll see that our GOV dipped a little bit, and we're baking that in. into the guide. The second point, I'll make is the macro environment continues to remain uncertain and so we haven't seen any impact from weakening consumer spend, at least so far in Q2, but we're accounting for that uncertainty because it could have an impact on normal course seasonality in the bounce back that you see in Q4. And so that's what we're baking into our guidance. And then can you repeat the question on macro?\nNikhil Devnani: Yeah. Just any indication that consumers might be trading down in the types of restaurants they order from? And just a reminder what your demographics look like for the customer base? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yeah. What I'll say on that point is at least based on the data we've seen so far, we haven't seen anything that would point to a particular income peer or people shifting from certain types of restaurants to another. In fact, I think we said in the letter, Shopclues increased because of higher item prices. But that was offset by fewer items per order as consumers responded to inflation. So it's less that they're shifting away and adjusting their buying behavior from other restaurants. They just -- they're spending the same amount, just buying a few things. And that just goes to show you how resilient the category is. Convenience and delivery and dining in has become a stable part of people's lives and you're seeing that in the data.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael McGovern: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig a little bit into the gas rewards program. Just curious, I noticed you listed as the program as one of the contributing factors to Dasher cost per order actually being down. So I was wondering, is there a potential impact on Dasher supply or Dashers per order when the gas rewards program ends? And then secondly, is there a chance that that could be extended beyond August 31, if there is a potential supply impact from that? And are the savings from that ending in August currently being baked into guidance for Q3 and for the full year?\nPrabir Adarkar: Michael, it's Prabir. Maybe I'll take a your question. Yeah, we spent over $14 million in gas savings program, and we see very positive feedback from Dashers. You are the commentary I think you're referring to is it's not a Dasher cost per order reduced, but what ended up happening is the retention of our existing fleet improved. And that the improvement in that retention of the existing fleet was driven by three things is the product changes that will need in order to help attention, it's the gas rewards program that frankly displays the increase in fuel costs for Dashers and third, the macro factors that we talked about around declining consumer savings and rising inflation. And so it's the combination of these three things that we believe improved the retention of our existing fleet that then resulted in us needing fewer new Dashers, and therefore, acquiring a greater portion of our Dashers organically than we otherwise would. That then translate into lower that costs. In terms of renewing the program, it's too early to say right now. We have assume that we will -- we continue to operate the current Dasher program to the end of August, and we'll make a color depending on where gas prices are high as well as other things. At the end of the day, it might be a cheaper way to obtain Dashers, what we'll see as we need progress here in the quarter.\nMichael McGovern: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Hey. I wanted to ask about whether you're seeing any pressure from competitors in nonurban markets, either on the restaurant supply, acquisition side or consumer incentives? And since the Amazon Grubhub deal was sort of announced, does that show up in any of the metrics that you track? Thank you very much.\nTony Xu: I can lead off and then feel free to chime in here, Prabir. So far, we haven't seen impact whether it's recent competitor announcements or moves to invest in certain types of geographies versus other types of geographies in the numbers, but obviously, we're taking stock of what's happening. But I think it's important to remember, regardless of what's happening in the external environment that our focus is making sure that we continue building the best products. I mean, at the end of the day, the customer, whether it's for our platform or someone else's, they're going to judge all of us on the combination of the selection of places we deliver from the quality of that delivery experience in terms of speed, timeliness and accuracy, the affordability of the platform and the customer service level. And it's that combination, I think, that so far has been evidenced or performance with leading retention and order frequency that has separated us from the pack. And we have to just keep making sure that we stay ahead on that dimension. At the end of the day, it's that combination that ultimately is going to judge us or anyone else and even if you offer the product for free if that combination isn't where it needs to be for the customer, I'm not sure it's going to matter.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Tony.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. I would like to thank our speakers, and thank you all for joining us today. This now concludes the call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Prabir Adarkar",
            "content": "And Deepak on your second question around 2023, we're not providing quantitative 2023 guidance today, we will provide 2023 guidance when we report Q4, which is on a normal cycle, but I will provide some sort of thematic context. The first thing I'll say is going into 2023, we do expect our core U.S. restaurant business to grow and increase its contribution profit. At current course and speed, we plan to increase annually EBITDA by a modest amount. Now, note that this is after absorbing a full year of Wolt. So, said definitely core DoorDash ex-Wolt will expand a bit into 2023, even though the consolidated EBITDA won't grow meaningfully. And the only caveat we'll make to this is this could change if we identify attractive growth opportunities. We continue to remain in investment mode and look for these opportunities that benefit or retention order frequency, but at current course and speed, we would expect annual EBITDA to grow by a modest amount. And Lloyd on the second part of your question, first I'll talk about Q2, and then I'll talk about some general philosophy. In terms of the Q2 performance and EBITDA, it was really a matter of two factors. The first was subtotals. As we described in the letter, as a result of consumer price inflation, our subtotals were higher because of higher item prices. And that then translates into higher commission dollars as well as high service fees, both of which benefit revenue and drop through to EBITDA. So, that's what drove the upside in Q2 in terms of EBITDA, In terms of general philosophy, I'll say our EBITDA is a function of really two things. First, it's the margin expansion that we continue to drive in our U.S. restaurant business. That's one thing. The second is the level of investment we make, which is discretionary, by the way below investment we make in our new verticals and in our international businesses. That level of investment varies from quarter-to-quarter based on the signals we see. And you can see that volatility in our historical trends where some quarters will produce more EBITDA than others because depending on what we see, in terms of retention all the frequency, we might invest more or less. And so our EBITDA range is really meant as a guiderail. But when we land within that range base, depending on the level of investment. Maybe I'll start and then Tony can chime in. I mean, the Wolt business goals 30% year-on-year, and that's in stark contrast to what we've seen with other companies that operate in a similar geographic region. And really, it all comes back down to two things is the fundamentals of the business in terms of its industry leading retention and growing order frequency. And we've seen it as long as you create a product that has high retention or the frequency, it ultimately translates into better growth, because you're retaining your customers better and that benefit compounds versus alternatives, when you end up losing customers because of poor retention. And where we're at in terms of the investment cycle, the bull markets are relatively new, both in terms of merchant adoption, as well as user adoption, as an example, even in its oldest market, adoption levels are less than 10% of the population, that test drive, there's a lot of room to grow, just as you grow your footprint within these countries, as well as you grows merchants selection, and grow the consumer base. And so that's driving investment we're making and we'll continue investing, as long as we see strong signal on retention and all the frequency. Well, we don't break out the guidance between Wolt and DoorDash. But when we do report earnings, you will split out organic versus OLS contribution. And Bernie, on your second question around Wolt's growth, it's really driven by two things, it's MAU growth that was aided by some customer acquisition, but also by just by higher retention compared to the other players in the market. And then second order frequency growth, as Board brings on more selection both in the restaurant as well as the non-restaurant category, we're seeing some of the same things, as you saw in the U.S. where order frequency at a cohort level has continued to grow. And both of those things, particularly in the face of some of the more extreme COVID reversion that you saw in Europe, have led to the 50% year-on-year growth that they've decided. Hey, Brian, it's Prabir. So, let me let me start on both of your questions. So, first, our cost of sales increase that we saw on a year-on-year basis was only driven by two things, DashMart and insurance costs on DashMarts, as we've launched more and more DashMarts, the cost associated with those orders impacts cost of sales. So, roughly half of the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of GOV is driven by DashMarts. The other half roughly is driven by an increase in insurance costs, which was in line with our expectations, pointed to our comments from last quarter, where we said we experienced an increase in insurance reserves due to the outsized have been backed up a few large games. And we began to take actions on -- to improve the safety on our platform starting last quarter. But it takes a while for these changes to reflect on our claims data. And so as we previously discussed, we expect insurance costs to increase in the near-term. On the whole -- both the DashMarts cost increases as well as insurance cost is reflected in the guidance we provided. And so it's not incremental to the guidance, it's already reflected in there. In terms of gross margin for Wolt, here Wolt is combination of as I view it, so three distinct pieces. There's investments that are going into Japan and Germany. These are brand new market that we launched less than two years ago. Well, to get the flywheel going in terms of selection and quality and price. You've got investments in both market which is the equivalent of our DashMarts Wolt's first party distribution business, and then you've got the rest what I call core food delivery. Core food delivery is at consistent increase in gross margin levels and as we continue driving efficiency and order density, the local level, you start seeing the same type of efficiency in terms of Dasher cost kick in to produce increasing levels of gross margin. Japan and Germany both markets remain in investment mode and we continue to work on coverage, selection, quality and price there. Hey Eric, it's Prabir. Maybe I'll start with the first one around how we're going to manage the business and EBITDA impact of growth and Tony can talk about the impact from some of the new categories. So, maybe the first place to start is our core U.S. restaurant business is growing and continues to generate significant cash flow. And historically, we've taken that cash flow and invested the vast majority of it in order to grow and scale in these large and underpenetrated categories in which we operate. Again, as I said earlier, these investments are discretionary and so that means, the reason we're investing is because we continue to see strong signals of product market fit, as well as improving unit economics. Just to give you an example, if I -- on any given day, if I look at the top 10 stores on DoorDash in terms of sales, DashMart shows up, and that's a strong signal of product market fit. To the extent that we don't see continued improvements in terms of unit economics or continued improvements, retention or frequency, we will alter the pace of our investment. We've been very disciplined in terms of capital allocation so far, and we'll continue to do so going forward. Andrew, maybe I'll start with the Dasher cost question, and then Tony can take the one on our platform services. So in terms of Dasher cost, I mean, at the end of the day, there's multiple components of this, including, as Tony alluded to earlier, how stores operations, in terms of how quickly they get the Dasher in and out. So there's opportunities to continue optimizing that, there's opportunities to continue dispatching from closer and closer Dashers which, by the way, as the density of your network increases, as you get more orders occurring within a certain neighborhood, within a certain store, you've got the ability to not just batch, but you've got the ability to get the Dasher to the store quicker than you otherwise might have. And so there's really -- if you think about the sources of opportunities, really reducing the amount of time it takes for a Dasher to get to the store, and reducing the amount of time that the Dasher spends in the store. And we continue to work both those levers and that's what's resulted in the improvement in terms of Dasher cost that we're seeing. The second thing I'll say, which is really just to clarify, last year was anomalous in terms of Dasher cost, because we were operating in a very expensive labor environment that was fueled by fiscal stimulus. So, in some ways, Dasher cost this year just -- at least my mind, normalizing back to historical levels versus ending incremental. So last year was elevated, this year isn't. Hey, Ron. So on -- let me start with the second first. On the US restaurant profitability, we're not actually -- we haven't provided any disclosure to break that out other than to say that continues generating more contribution profit and has improved both in terms of its net revenue margins, as well as its contribution profit as a percentage of GOV on a year-on-year basis. So we're happy with the progress there. And as we've said previously, it's a valuable funding source that we use to make investments in these new categories that were growing. In terms of your question around the order rate chart, really by the way the purpose of that chart was to demonstrate the fact that the order rate trends were similar to what we've seen historically. And to make the point that increase inflation, as well as potentially weakening consumer spending has not had an adverse impact relative to old cohorts. And so it's hard for us to untangle the impact of consumer spending from ordinary core seasonality. But taking a step back in terms of the 2022 cohorts, we're happy with the quality so far. Remember, we run our sales and marketing to a payback period, we've been operating within the same payback period for quite some time now. And so what's driving that is not just enhanced order frequency, which has continued growing on a year-on-year basis, as a result of improvements in selection, quality and price as well as the new categories that we're adding, but also improvements in terms of the core margin structure of the product. And so the core product has gotten more profitable in part due to subtotals. But also, in part because of improvements in terms of Dasher cost, the quality of our orders, which improves our customer support costs and so on. And that coupled with the order frequency is contributed to better LTVs and probably the same payback. Yes. Ross, maybe I'll start and Tony can chime in. So first, on the 30% retention, I'm not sure what the 48% is that you're referring to. The 30% is month 12 retention. And if you actually compare that to DoorDash versus Wolt and apples-to-apples basis, it's pretty comparable in some markets is even higher. So we feel good about the retention stats when you compared to our data. And when you look at our data using third-party sources, we understand that our retention is better than everybody else in the category. In terms of the European competitors, there isn't an exact apples-to-apples source where that compares market-to-market based on what we're seeing in terms of competitors in the UK and other markets that are covered, the 30% actually compares very favorably. On the question of DashPass, DashPass frequency as well as order frequency of classic product, you really need to look at it on a cohort level. Yes, you've got mix shift between as you get more DashPass subscribers, the blended order frequency grows. But even on a cohort level, the underlying order frequency has continued to grow. And what's driving that is these new categories. We're seeing people adopt new categories, Tony referred to the 14% adoption rate at the end of Q4, which has continued to grow in Q1 and Q2 and that's driving order frequency and frequency growth at the cohort levels. Doug, can you clarify, are you talking about Q3 or Q4? Yeah. The full year outlook of EBITDA, I mean, we're bringing it up because we've made progress here in the business both in terms of overall scale has increased relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year. If you remember our guidance at the beginning of the year was -- I think it was 49 million to 50 million at the top end. So that's gone up. Second, we are seeing positive benefits in terms of sub totals, which we talked about earlier, which results in more revenue and EBITDA. Third, Dasher costs are trending slightly better and that's been driven by two things as product changes that have helped drive increased retention of our Dashers as well as some of the macro factors such as rising cost of living and declining consumer savings that are helping increase the retention of our existing fleet. So it's these various factors that have given us a little more confidence on EBITDA, as a result of which, we have increased the low end of our guidance. And it's really a commitment to say that, we're going to stay above breakeven. Sure. Maybe I'll take a crack at that. So the first thing I'd say is our consumer metrics remain healthy. So if you look at what happened in Q2, our MAUs grew by double digits year-on-year, order frequency grew, our pace of consumer acquisition continued to remain healthy. And these signals provide a solid foundation for growth in the long term. With respect to the second half specifically, we expect normal course seasonality this year. So in general, we've experienced growth in Q4 and Q1. Sequential growth in Q2 and Q3 is usually muted as a result of summer seasonality. In fact, if you look at our Q2 to Q3 growth last year, you'll see that our GOV dipped a little bit, and we're baking that in. into the guide. The second point, I'll make is the macro environment continues to remain uncertain and so we haven't seen any impact from weakening consumer spend, at least so far in Q2, but we're accounting for that uncertainty because it could have an impact on normal course seasonality in the bounce back that you see in Q4. And so that's what we're baking into our guidance. And then can you repeat the question on macro? Yeah. What I'll say on that point is at least based on the data we've seen so far, we haven't seen anything that would point to a particular income peer or people shifting from certain types of restaurants to another. In fact, I think we said in the letter, Shopclues increased because of higher item prices. But that was offset by fewer items per order as consumers responded to inflation. So it's less that they're shifting away and adjusting their buying behavior from other restaurants. They just -- they're spending the same amount, just buying a few things. And that just goes to show you how resilient the category is. Convenience and delivery and dining in has become a stable part of people's lives and you're seeing that in the data. Michael, it's Prabir. Maybe I'll take a your question. Yeah, we spent over $14 million in gas savings program, and we see very positive feedback from Dashers. You are the commentary I think you're referring to is it's not a Dasher cost per order reduced, but what ended up happening is the retention of our existing fleet improved. And that the improvement in that retention of the existing fleet was driven by three things is the product changes that will need in order to help attention, it's the gas rewards program that frankly displays the increase in fuel costs for Dashers and third, the macro factors that we talked about around declining consumer savings and rising inflation. And so it's the combination of these three things that we believe improved the retention of our existing fleet that then resulted in us needing fewer new Dashers, and therefore, acquiring a greater portion of our Dashers organically than we otherwise would. That then translate into lower that costs. In terms of renewing the program, it's too early to say right now. We have assume that we will -- we continue to operate the current Dasher program to the end of August, and we'll make a color depending on where gas prices are high as well as other things. At the end of the day, it might be a cheaper way to obtain Dashers, what we'll see as we need progress here in the quarter."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Hey, Deepak its Tony. Yes, look on the first question our business has been always very competitive, ever since we founded the company nine years ago. And I think that what's been very impressive to us is just how resilient our business has been, both in light of competitive activities, both recent, and in the years that we've been building DoorDash as well as just the macro environment. As you know, we do see some consumer spending softening, but largely, we've been not impacted by that downward pressure. I really think that you see a lot of kind of the premise of your question reflected in our results. I mean, this is a quarter in which we beat topline, as well as in bottom-line, we grew results 25% GOV year-on-year. And we beat quite handily on the bottom-line, as well. And this is on top of a lot of the types of things that we're investing in. One that I will call out is that while we're not seeing any elevated pressures from certain types of incentives from competitors, what we are doing is we are taking care of our audiences. We invested over $40 million alone in the second quarter just to make sure that the Dashers, who are on the road, doing the hard work, can keep the profits that they expect to keep given some of the rising costs with fuel. And so, we're not seeing any of the elevated pressures we're seeing fairly normal activity on that side. And I think as a result, given our industry leading retention and order frequency, you continue to see our growth and our share gains. Yes. Hey, Lloyd, it's Tony, I'll take the first question and maybe Prabir can take the second part of the question. With respect to efficiency gains from logistics, I think this has been a hallmark of the DoorDash story and also, the Wolt story now that we've officially closed that partnership, in which if you think about the game that we're playing, or the business that we're in, we're really in the game of building a minimum efficient scale business. That's the type of business when you're talking about a hyperlocal business where order density is the most important metric. And in order to achieve that, you kind of have to do two things. One of the things you talked about in your question, which is really around high quality logistics efficiency, and the other is high quality, retention and order behavior from customers, without discounting, and that sort of activity. And DoorDash has really achieved both. And on the part around getting extra logistics efficiency, we continue to find areas of opportunity. I mean, we've certainly been leaders in our space, up to this point. But I still see massive room to keep increasing the selection on our platform and improve the logistics quality on our platform, the affordability of our service, and certainly our customer service levels. On logistics, more specifically, whether it's working on efficiency improvements at the store, as well as how we think about how we ought assign orders, especially now that we're entering multiple categories of deliveries, in addition to restaurant deliveries, I think there's a long room to go. And we're seeing that both in our numbers -- in the most recent quarter, as well as in the quarters leading up to this point. Yes, and on the second part of the question, I think it's important to start with maybe some historical context, and go down memory lane, not just, just a few years ago, DoorDash was certainly not the market leader and DoorDash, especially, five, six years ago was quite capital-constrained relative to any of its peers by a pretty far margin. And so, how was it possible that a, 'subscale company' was able to rise to market leadership, while it really was mastering the order level execution of the business, and again, you know, this is a hyperlocal business for order density, and achieving minimum efficient scale, through leading a retention order frequency, which is really, you know, measured in whether or not you build a superior product of selection, quality prices, and service. And then on the other end, whether or not you have the most capital efficient logistics operations, and I think when I look at the elements that cause DoorDash, to rise to market leadership, I find very similar kinds of characteristics and the Wolt business, which is what excited us about their business, not only today, as Prabir mentioned, far outgrowing some of their European peers. But maybe much more excited, are we in their potential, because when I compare the foundation of what they've built, and I look at, you know, the opportunity ahead of them, I mean, even in their oldest markets, bolt is less than 10% penetrated. On a global basis, both DoorDash and Wolt in our non-U.S. markets are less than 5% of restaurant sales, and outside of restaurants, less than 1% of non-food spend. And so when I compare the foundation that bolt has built on one hand, and on the other hand, compare it to the opportunity head, it's exactly what Prabir said, which is that it's absolutely the right time to invest. And I think you already see evidence of this as Wolt has become a market leader in many of their markets already. Sure. Maybe I'll take the first question. And I'll let Prabir take the second question. So, I'm not sure if this touches exactly the spirit of your question. But we view all merchants including grocers, as partners, maybe think about the mission of the company, the mission of the company is to, on one hand, build the largest local commerce marketplace, where we're driving incremental demand to all of these retailers, whether they be restaurants, grocers, convenience stores, other types of retail stores. And then on the other hand, build the largest local commerce platform where we give the tools whether it's logistics as a service in the form of DoorDash Drive, or ordering as a service in the form of DoorDash Storefront to all of these retailers so that they can build their own digital operations. So, we really view in equal parts, our mission to help grow on one hand, which is to bring that incremental demand and on the other hand, empower them to do it on their own. In fact, we see these customers on these different channels to be quite different. I mean if you think about it if a customer is quite used to and knows exactly what they want to order from a particular retailer, it probably makes quite a lot of sense for them on that occasion to actually order directly from the retailer. But on -- the greatest privilege that we have in this business is that people eat 20 to 25 times a week. And they shop even more times than that on top of that when you consider their non-food spend. And so for other occasions, maybe when they're not exactly sure what it is that they're looking for, but they want to buy something from the neighborhood, that's where the DoorDash Marketplace really comes in hand. And so we really view the retailer, the merchants, whether it's a grocer or other type of store, as our partner, and we have two ways in which we help them. Yes, and I think, if there's -- I'll add a little bit in terms of just my view on, the macro environment. And then and then I'll hit your second question about, the multi-category customer. So, obviously, we've been looking right, in terms of how the tough macroeconomic headwinds that, I think is hitting a lot of industries, how that might apply to us. We've been searching for this for many quarters now. And I think so far, the reason why largely we've been less impacted is because well, one, you know, our product is dynamic, it's been constantly improving. If you look at selection, for instance, in the 12 months, leading up to the end of the second quarter, we've added 80,000, net new stores onto the platform, we've made improvements to many quality metrics, in terms of our delivery experiences, whether it's speed, or accuracy, and other types of improvements, we've made many improvements to the shopping experience to lower the friction for consumers. And so I think that's one point. The second point is, I think we still have to remember that relative, especially to other maybe categories of commerce, or E commerce, we are still very early in our penetration, you know, even as the market leader just take the U.S. as one example, we're less than 8% of total restaurant industry sales. And we compare that to other categories of commerce, it is much earlier in its evolution. And then the final thing I would just add is just if you study macro -- as we've been looking at macroeconomics, I think there's only been a couple years in history in which food spend has actually declined due to challenging macroeconomic pressures. And I think that's just because it is less of a discretionary spend relative to other categories of spend. But that's said, to Prabir's point we're equal opportunity, growth investors that are very disciplined, you know, DoorDash, historically hasn't had a lot of resources. And so we take very seriously every dollar of spending, and as you saw in the second quarter, if we don't think that there's a great investment to be made over the same time period to generate a great return, we're not going to make that investment. And so that's true with all new projects, that's true with marketing investments, that's true with engineering and product investments. That's true with headcount, that's really true for every line item in the P&L. All right. Moving on to your second question, which I think was about the impact of consumer shopping in multiple categories? Well, one, this is just part of the mission of the company is to make sure we bring everything inside the neighborhood and not just from restaurants. And two, the last disclosure we made was -- I think, in the fourth quarter, we said that about 14% of our customers are now shopping in these non-restaurant categories, and we are seeing higher retention order frequency activity from these customers who are, who are engaging in multiple categories. And I think this makes quite a lot of sense as we're solving now different jobs and tasks for the customer. But that said, look, we still have to earn every inch. We have a long ways to go in terms of the product experience in each one of these categories, before we'd be satisfied with that behavior. Yes. And with respect to the second question around our platform service products, such as Drive, we see continued excitement for the stores, but I mean, in many ways our platform services business experiences similar seasonality is our marketplace business versus the second and third quarters are generally more muted in activity. And that's mostly because as you know, customers are back out, many of whom are taking advantage of the good weather, as well as perhaps last vacations from the beginning of two years of COVID. And now eating out again, or visiting retail stores again, that -- these stores have to make sure that their in-store activity is protected and taken care of, and that customer service levels are exceptional, before they invest aggressively in their off-premise business. So while there's some seasonal kinds of activity happening in that business. I think the COVID highs in terms of the excitement to invest in continue to accelerate the momentum behind e-commerce for all of these retailers, across any category remains just as high as ever. And so that's something that we expect to continue to help grow our platform services business, whether they're large merchants, like some of the ones you mentioned, who participate with products like DoorDash Drive or smaller merchants that really need help getting online for the first time and growing their kind of same-store sales off-premise with products like DoorDash Storefront. And so our focus right now is making sure that those products can be easier to use and that we can build products to help teach the playbooks that we've used to build a successful digital marketplace in our own right, such that these businesses can do it on their own. Yes, Jason. So first on the DashPass front, what I should say is we've not observed any impact on our DashPass signups as a result of people going back to the office and increases ride sharing or anything like that, in fact, our DashPass subject has continued to grow both on the year-on-year basis, as well as quarter-on-quarter basis to record highs. So we feel good that DashPass is a key component of driving better affordability for consumers, and the growth has been consistent and reliable. So that's great. In terms of Dasher costs, the reduction in Dasher costs was really driven by two things. There's the Dasher cost per order, which I mentioned earlier was really a normalization from the elevated levels last year, because of increased fiscal stimulus. There also was, if you recall last year increased advertising costs because everyone is competing for Dashers and that environment has gotten a little bit better, which has driven lower Dashers costs in Q2, and those dasher costs continue to remain where they were in the last couple of months of the quarter. I can lead off and then feel free to chime in here, Prabir. So far, we haven't seen impact whether it's recent competitor announcements or moves to invest in certain types of geographies versus other types of geographies in the numbers, but obviously, we're taking stock of what's happening. But I think it's important to remember, regardless of what's happening in the external environment that our focus is making sure that we continue building the best products. I mean, at the end of the day, the customer, whether it's for our platform or someone else's, they're going to judge all of us on the combination of the selection of places we deliver from the quality of that delivery experience in terms of speed, timeliness and accuracy, the affordability of the platform and the customer service level. And it's that combination, I think, that so far has been evidenced or performance with leading retention and order frequency that has separated us from the pack. And we have to just keep making sure that we stay ahead on that dimension. At the end of the day, it's that combination that ultimately is going to judge us or anyone else and even if you offer the product for free if that combination isn't where it needs to be for the customer, I'm not sure it's going to matter."

I'm pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Prabir Adarkar. We'd like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements during this call, including our expectations of our business, financial position, operating performance, future results and guidance, our investment approach, strategy and statements regarding our acquisition of Wolt. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and some such risks are described in our risk factors included in our SEC filings, including Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, information regarding our non-GAAP financial results, including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our investor letter, which is available on our IR website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call in its entirety is being audio webcast on our IR website, an audio replay of the call will be available on our site shortly after the call ends. As in previous quarters, we'll go straight into the Q&A portion. So, with that, operator, please take the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hi, Tony, Prabir. I just had one high level and then one more near-term. So in the letter, I really like how you laid out the philosophy around investing proceeds from the U.S. restaurant profit pools into these new areas with precision. And I think some folks on the line here are a little worried that after Wolt closes and that philosophy holds up, you're just going to have a lot more areas by which you can reinvest those profit pools across all of Europe. So can you just maybe just talk about how that philosophy might change post-Wolt? And then the second question is based on the revenue margin and overall commentary on take rate, it looks like you're having no problems navigating supply and fuel inflation doesn't seem to be an issue. But any noticeable changes from all the inflation out there on Dasher cost per order either kind of in the first quarter or anything we should expect looking ahead? Thanks a lot.\nTony Xu: Hi, Ross, it's Tony. I'll take the first one and I'll let Prabir take the second one. So on the first one, well, I would say two parts. First is just our investment strategy with Wolt, and then secondly just our investment philosophy in general. Our aspiration is to build the largest global, local commerce business and we want to do that with building two assets. We want to build the largest local commerce marketplace where we're bringing everything inside the neighborhood to you and we also want to build the largest local commerce platform where we're giving tools to the physical businesses so that they each can become their own digital powerhouses and that's really why we're excited about teaming up with the Wolt because they share that same vision to build that truly global local commerce business as well. And from our perspective, it's really going to take a similar investment philosophy in terms of how we've built everything else. So in the investments shareholder letter, we gave an example of how we built effectively a new business from scratch in the last couple of years in the convenience category and kind of outline how we always start by first making sure that we build the best product possible especially measure in terms of retention order frequency. We have a maniacal focus on the unit math to get the unit economics to work, and then we start considering efficient ways to actually scale that business. So while we are aggressive in how we run these experiments to be able to achieve those input outcomes, we're very disciplined about how we think about how to scale these businesses. And it's going to be no different as we think about the opportunity to team up with Wolt. We think the opportunity obviously is immense. I mean if you look at this opportunity globally, in the restaurants category, in the U.S. we're even as the market leader only 6% of total restaurant industry sales. If you extend that into these other categories of restaurants or convenience or retail we're significantly smaller percentage. If we add in the countries now with Wolt, adds on top of that which gets us to a combined portfolio of about 26 countries, we're almost on an unnoticeable percentage. And then even if you combine -- and then if you add on top of that digitization that's happening on the merchants websites and apps themselves, many of which we power through products like DoorDash Drive and Storefront, as well as other products. We're in the early ascendings but the investment philosophy remains the same, where there is a maniacal focus on building the best-in-class products, a maniacal focus on getting laser sharp on the unit map so that's actually positive before we scale globally.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. Hey, Ross. And just to add to that point before I move on to the second part of your question. If you recall, when we announced Wolt, one of the things that we were excited about was the unit economics and the retention. So Wolt gives us a more efficient engine through which we can invest internationally and that's why what we had communicated was even after integrating Wolt, we expect our EBITDA expectations for the year to be materially unchanged because we're essentially now redeploying capital that we would have deployed but till the Wolt engine, which is actually more efficient. So hopefully that gets to the crux of your question. On the supply question, we have not experienced supply shortages and we feel good about our supply position looking ahead. Some stats to share with you. Our Dasher costs as a percentage of GOV will be were lower both quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year. Recall -- if you recall last year in Q1, we were undersupply due to bad weather as well as fiscal stimulus and we began investing over the course of last year, as well as this quarter frankly to continue to build a supply base where we can address the demand that we had anticipated. The second point and this is a little bit of a nuanced one. Our batch rates are down both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year and this is my point to that is because in some occasions, if we find ourselves undersupply, you may see batch rates go up. As a matter of fact, we actually had lower batch rates today than we were a year ago or even last quarter. And then the last point I'll make is our cost to acquire new Dashers. So our cost to acquire renewed Dashers is the lowest it's been in the last four quarters. So all that to say, we feel really good from a supply standpoint not just because we invest in advance, in order to address this demand but because we don't compete with rideshare for Dashers. This is a completely different pool of people.\nAndy Hargreaves: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Hi guys. So just a couple of questions from me. One, could you maybe just talk about, I know you haven't closed on Wolt yet, but considering their geographic footprint, et cetera, can you maybe just talk about how that business has performed? Just given the war headwinds, et cetera, and how has it been tracking relative to your own growth? And then in the letter, Tony, you talked about how you guys continue to see opportunity into increase contribution margin as a percentage of marketplace GOV in the U.S. marketplace, I think. Just -- can you just help us think through, how much higher can these get over overtime, say over the next year or two as you keep -- as you need that money to invest in all these new initiatives that you're you've highlighted in the letter? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Thanks for the question, Youssef. So on the Wolt question specifically, the deal is on track to close in the second quarter. We can't comment on Wolt's performance before the deal is closed but in connection with the closing of the transaction, we'll provide more detail on come back to the street good specific. So, stay tuned for that. Now, on your question on U.S. contribution margins, we haven't disclosed the exact contribution margin in the U.S. restaurant business, but let me try to answer your question in sort of qualitative terms, which is the first thing, we have driven increasing margins in the U.S. restaurant business while growing categories there. And the reason that's important is because it is easy to do one or the other, which is either grow margins outdoor category share, those remarkable progress that we've made in actually growing both. And looking into the future, there's multiple levers that are available to continue doing so without hurting growth. First, as we continue to drive up, the efficiency of the logistics network, that will help our margin structure in the U.S. Second, as we continue improving the quality of the delivery experience, that will help with customer support costs as well as the refunds. And then finally, there is leverage in certain parts of cost of sales as well as single marketing which will help the margin structure. Now beyond this as our ads business scales, this is an incremental tailwind to the margin structure. So all of these things will come together to help the margins for the U.S restaurant business grow and fund not just other things, but reinvestment in that -- in the core U.S. restaurant business. Because our objective is -- we're not running the U.S. restaurant business to harvest margins. We're still investing in U.S. restaurants in order to build scale and continue to grow category share.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. I was just wondering, since you talk -- mentioned the unit economic changes on the convenience business and some of the other categories you're going into. Can you compare and contrast those sort of unit economic curves looking at maybe using the U.S. restaurants as a baseline, and how maybe some of these new categories could be different as you sort of reach some ideal scale? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. I mean you have to remember that these are -- it's like comparing a two-year-old to a 10-year, so it's kind of hard to compare an apples-to-apples as well. Say in a matter of two years, given that we've got line of sight to introduce breakeven unit economics in 3P convenience business is quite remarkable. And you need to pair that with the fact that we are number one in the convenience space and this is just in the matter of two years. Over time, this thing that we will do to continue driving up those margin. So I don't want to provide a forecast to where the margin structure gets to, because you got a lot and so we're right now at the walk stage. We're getting to breakeven and then in the future, we'll continue driving our margins. Today, the vast majority of the margin comes from the U.S. restaurant business, other areas are sort of in your margin consumers, so to speak, but over time as they hit maturity and start to see us generate more and more profits on these areas.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Your line is open\nLloyd Walmsley: Great. I have two. First kind of sticking to the unit economic question. In the letter, you talked about convenience looking to generate a positive variable profit in the second half. Can you just help us contextualize that in and is this a big flip over the last year or so? And what is -- actually what you see driving that flip to variable profit contribution in the second half. And then the second one there were some press reports about slowing hiring at DoorDash recently. Is this accurate? Can you talk about what you're seeing causing you to slow hiring or maybe just shifting priorities ahead of Wolt? Anything you could share there would be great. Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Lloyd, maybe I'll take the first and Tony can take the second, Lloyd. So on the question around 3P convenience, you have to remember when we started this category, it was a -- we knew those demand for it because we saw what consumers were searching for, right, and that demand got further amplified by COVID. But what we didn't completely appreciate is exactly how different and unique the sale is compared to restaurant. And so that's the learning curve we've been on that is now going to the other side as we turn the curve and profitability. So simple things like our Dashers need to go into stores to pick and pack. We need a different way to understand the inventory positions at the store and how do we guide the Dasher when they are inside the store. The basket sizes tend to be lower. So this is where our operational to the execution focus and product focus muscle really have shown because it allowed us to take this problem that looked unique to the restaurants and actually create products around it in order to make the math work even with lower basket sizes and picking and packing requirement. So that's what I'd say. Now there is suddenly a lot more we can do in terms of for the cart up sales as well as other things including advertising attach by the way to drive up the unit economics, and we're super early given that it's only 22 years old.\nTony Xu: Yes. I think the only other thing I'd add before I take the question, Lloyd on hiring is just, I think it's important to realize, especially when you're talking about the immense opportunity in something like convenience or grocery, which is a hundreds of billions of dollars more than a trillion-dollar opportunity globally. It's a very long runway in terms of how we think about this. To be -- Canada was very impressed by how our teams were able to do all the things that Prabir said and on top of that build a new catalog that is item based, that has tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of items per store instead of hundreds of items inside of a restaurant and we rebuilt search into an item based experience first before a store based experience. I mean there's a lot of things that the team built and they were able in parallel to move the unit economics. And I think it's just -- it's a huge testament to the team in terms of the work that they did in both moving at the top and the bottom line of building a better product that customers would be using over, and again, and then also making moves on the profitability front. On hiring, I guess the first thing I would say is, you've got to be careful with what you read because it's probably either not in context or just not accurate. We're hiring at actually still very aggressive rates, multiples in fact of what I believe has been reported. But in general, let me talk a little bit about hiring maybe in the context of just our investment philosophy because it's very similar. If you look at the history of DoorDash or how perhaps sort of where we came from and maybe how we have enabled this continuous efficient process of inventing and in a disciplined way of scaling the business. It really came from the fact that we had a lot of constraints early on in the business. I mean, for the first six to 6.5 years of the business, we had a fraction of the financing of some of our peers. And so there is no ability to hire huge teams or spend a lot on marketing spend anything on discounts or subsidies. We had to invent and win by building a superior product, gain profitability in the right way is not by doing unnatural things that hurt the customer experience but by doing the things that would increase selection, that would improve the service quality of our deliveries, that would offer more value in the form of DashPass and other programs and improve our customer support. And all of these things is what led us to have industry-leading retention, which has yielded I think some of the numbers that we've shown in the shareholder letter, all-time highs and our monthly active users even as thankfully customers are now finally returning back inside restaurants. All-time highs and our DashPass subscriber base, all-time highs in our order frequency across cohorts. So building the best product as well as gaining efficiencies from operations and the scale economies from marketing, that's really how the business has been built. Now when I apply that same investment philosophy towards something like hiring, it can't just be -- to hire aggressively, it has to also be to invest in systems of how we can reapply systems that we've built for one category and make that a lot, give us leverage into categories, B, C, D, E or F. And all of these ways of how we actually architect a system designed towards building the best customer experience and having the most efficient P&L.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, I was just hoping you could talk about whether the inflationary pressures seen by your restaurant partners are changing the way they interact with utilized DoorDash? And then second, also, maybe you could talk about the response from Dashers to Dash Rewards Program and any commentary kind of way of framing how much that's costing you? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: Doug, maybe I'll start with the first here. Our average order values have increased slightly as a result of inflation. We obviously -- we pass on the large portion of that to our merchants and so they benefit as well, given that they're experiencing price increases in the cost of the food. And all else being equal, this would also have a positive impact on our margins. Now the one thing I'll say is, the reality is we've seen food cost inflation for over a year now, right, the chicken prices and other things. And so it's hard to tell exactly what impact inflation have in an order volume and in consumer engagement specifically because we don't have the counter-factual. Having said that, when we step back and you look at the results in the quarter, and the fact that monthly active users are all time highs, the fact that DashPass members are at all-time highs and order frequency is an all-time highs. It speaks to the resilience of the platform and the fact that the product has consistently gotten better and better and better in terms of selection, in terms of quality, in terms of affordability and that leads to more consumer adoption, habituation and an increasing usage over time. And then on your sector -- sorry, Tony, do you want to add something to that?\nTony Xu: Yes. So, Doug, I'll just -- I think your question has also foreseen any behavior on the merchant and the Dash on front. I would say a couple of things. Inflation is definitely a concern, we certainly are taking very seriously, and we're doing that by making sure that all of our audiences are taken care of first. And that -- and one of the things we've been fortunate to see, I'll echo a little bit of what Prabir said and then I'll take your question on merchants and Dashers which is, it's just the resiliency of the core business of U.S. restaurants where I think it's because when I take a look at all the possible areas where consumers could spend and consume, eating is still be one of the largest and certainly the highest frequency categories where people eat three times a day, 90 times a month. If you start looking at some of the other categories we now participate in, that's well over 100 shopping occasions per month. And when we have built the largest marketplace with the most retained and also the most engaged user base, it just gives us the most shots on goal in the face of something like inflation. And when they translate that into our other two audience the, merchants and Dashers. Merchants, they continue to see DoorDash as a way to actually gain sales, even though consumers are going inside their stores, which is fantastic. And that's because dining in is very complementary to actually order and delivery. I mean when you're dining in you're looking for that experience to maybe see people you haven't seen in a while in person and that's very complementary to order and delivery, because again you eat multiple times a day, 20 to 25 times a week. And then on the Dasher front, what we've done is we definitely recognize that inflation is impacting Dasher earnings and that's really what we want to the software. It was the right thing for us to do, given that we had a very fortunate position of having a U.S. restaurants business that's not only grown 250% over the last couple of years but that have materially also increased its profitability such that we can choose to reinvest those cash flows into serving all of audiences and that's what we did. We gave out two programs, one was a 10% cashback on fuel expenses and the other was a bonus program that was tied to the distance in which Dashers would be driving. And the results so far have been very, very satisfying where 90% of Dashers are really, really excited about the benefits that we have offered so far.\nPrabir Adarkar: And then just offer a little more color to what just Tony just described, Doug. Look we chose to absorb the costs of these Dasher benefits in order to preserve earnings and we could have chosen to pass on the cost to consumers and that would have had an impact on growth due to consumer price elasticity, but instead we chose to absorb the program costs. So let me explain why we did that. When we keep consumer prices unchanged and if we ensure the Dasher earnings are preserved, that enables us to maximize growth because having adequate supply ensures of the consumer quality is preserved which then drives the growth flywheel in a slightly different way, right. So then there is a question of, well, how do you fund it? And as Tony pointed out, the U.S. restaurant business is very profitable and we use the profits from the restaurant business for two things. First, as we previously talk about to invest in new areas, in international and so on. The second is reinvest back in the core restaurant business. So we're growing scale and generating growth in the core restaurant business. Historically, we've taken these efficiencies and we've use them to lower consumer prices, lower merchant commissions, increased DASH earnings. Today because of gas prices, there is this unique need for Dashers. And so where we're allocating more investment to actually help increase DASH earnings. If gas prices revert in the future, we'll revisit that. So in short, absorbing these costs is basically net neutral to our EBITDA expectations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael McGovern: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if you would double click into the metric that Q1 '22 was the largest quarter for new consumer acquisition since Q1 last year despite lower sales and marketing as a percent of revenue? What's driving this? And are these -- I was curious if these customers are still primarily coming from a restaurant -- from the restaurant category or have been more -- are they coming more frequently for non-restaurant for the first time? Thanks.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. Thanks, Michael. Let me take this question. Yes, so if you look back Q1 '21, so, Q1 last year was elevated in terms of customer acquisition as a result of fiscal stimulus. Ignoring that quarter, if you look at every other quarter up to Q1 '22, we acquired more customers than we did and that just speaks to the fact that we're still under-penetrated in this category and there is more customers to be acquired. And then the last thing I'll say is, the majority of our business is the restaurant business and so a lot of these customers join and place their first order on restaurant. But we're seeing an interest interesting mix change where now we've got these number of customers joining to actually use some of our other categories, not just restaurants. And so it's too early because it's a small percentage you were talking about, but over time as DoorDash gets known for being your destination for all things local commerce, the source of what product these customers use when they first joined DoorDash will undoubtedly change.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions from us. First, maybe -- can you unpack the drivers of sustained frequency gains? DashPass adoption and the non-food convenience categories is very strong, but how does it look between subscribers versus non-subscribers? With consumers kind of going back to pre-COVID lifestyles, are you seeing differences and maybe the type of orders in terms of time when it's placed and basket sizes? And then Prabir, just a financial question. Can you elaborate on the insurance reserves impact on first-quarter cost of revenues? Is that some kind of accrual adjustment or is there any change in underlying unit economics? Thank you.\nPrabir Adarkar: So Deepak...\nTony Xu: Deepak.\nPrabir Adarkar: Go ahead, Tony, I can pick up...\nTony Xu: Yes. I'll take the first question, Deepak, and then Prabir will handle the question on insurance. The reasons for the frequency gains are really coming from the improvements in our product. I mean there is certainly in parts some of the order frequency gains came from increasing contributions from our DashPass subscriber base. But if you -- when you step back, I think a couple of points still are very, very important. Number one, dine-in and order and delivery are very complementary. In fact, we saw this at almost every phase of the pandemic. There were various geographies and various parts of the world, including the U.S. where certain states had reopened more aggressively perhaps than some others where we saw that in the past couple of years and certainly we're still seeing that in the first quarter of this year and even currently, where people are not substituting eating in with eating out. The second point I would say is, we're constantly making improvements to the products. So we're constantly increasing inflection whether that's restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacy stores, alcohol stores, retail stores, et cetera, we're increasing the quality of the deliveries by maniacally getting rid of defects. We are improving affordability part of which is coming from DashPass and we're continuously investing in customer support to make sure that we always can delight customers and meet their increasing expectations. So that's really why our the frequencies are gone.\nPrabir Adarkar: And specifically on that Deepak, DashPass user order frequency has grown and you've also got an increase in mix towards DashPass. So those two things sort of act in concert with each other. And on your question on insurance reserves, we experienced an increase in the average claim amount driven by the outsized impact of for few very large claims. As a result, we adjusted our reserves for both for existing claims as well as the future claims by 35 million, which had about a 30 basis point impact to cost of sales. Even though the insurance cost increased, it's a relatively small portion of our cost of sales, certainly compared to other line items like payment processing or customer support and it's lower than what you might see in rideshare. And so, long saying this is an area where we haven't -- because it's been a small cost, we haven't focused on it, but it also represents an opportunity where we can -- we have begun now to put in place new processes to control these costs in the long term. Last thing I'll say is in the near term, we expect insurance costs to remain elevated in the near term because it takes a while for these changes to reflect in our claims data, but we're going to manage within the EBITDA range.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions guys. I have two. The first one, Tony, I know you always put a maniacal focus on efficiency and improving the process. Maybe just sort of qualitatively, can you talk to us about a couple of the biggest learning areas you still see room for improvement in the core U.S. restaurant delivery business? That's the first one. Then the second one, the point about the 3P convenience reaching positive variable contribution. Was that sort of in line with what you all thought at the start of the year or is that ahead of schedule? And if it is ahead of schedule, any reason why we're not raising full-year EBITDA, is it too small, or are we going to reinvest, if we touched about that a little bit. Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yes. Hi, Brian. There is still a large room to go in terms of finding more and more efficiency and really there's kind of two general ways I think about these. The first is, how do we just find the next level of product-market fit, which certainly would grow our retention and order frequency even further, thereby give us even more leverage on the sales and marketing side of the P&L, overall P&L. And then the second is really efficiency from operations. Take for example the wait times we still see at stores, I mean especially given some of the labor challenges that you're seeing at, whether it's restaurants or whether it's grocery stores or convenience stores, everyone in the service industry is certainly feeling this. That makes wait times as well as inventory management have higher variance. Being able to manage that variance and being able to lower those wait times and increase or improve the efficiency I should say, the inventory management, I think are all areas. But really you can find efficiency in every line item. And -- but the two general approaches, I generally think that this is how do we build the next level of product such that our consumers love it even more, which gives us lots of sales and marketing leverage. And then on the other side, it's really finding efficiency on the cost front.\nPrabir Adarkar: And then on your question, Brian on 3P convenience and why not raise the guide. It's a small portion right now and secondly, any profits we generated as I mentioned earlier we reinvest and try to drive scale and growth so that we maximize long-term profit dollars.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Josey from Citi. Your line is open.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question here. I wanted to ask maybe a bigger picture on DashPass just given the importance in greater overall frequency of usage and we're seeing more categories being added here and available on the service and that talks to the value. But I want to understand a bit more, how do you prove the value here to members? And surveys that we've run, one of the best parts of why people order or have DashPass is because it saves money. The same amount of folks on the other side, I'd say it's too expensive. So can you talk to us a little about the value on DashPass and marketing there? And then in the letter, Tony, you talked about first-party commerce and under penetration here. I wanted to hear a little bit more about what you're doing in terms of drive and how that might help answer those questions. Thank you.\nTony Xu: Sure. I can start and feel free Prabir if you want to chime in on some of these. But I think the first question around DashPass and value, kind of take us in two parts. One part, you kind of answered I think in your question, which really came to the foreign state, right. And I think that makes a lot of sense, especially for users that are discovering our product multiple times a month or possibly multiple times a week. I think we'll continue to make those investments. But the other thing I would say is that we also want to improve the product for DashPass itself by making sure that we can offer either exclusive or preferred types of product experiences that are only made available through DashPass as well as the fact that we're introducing so many more categories. I know that overall customers who ordered and who are ordering outside of our restaurants category the last number we announced was 14% in Q4, but in certain markets that number is much, much higher than that and you see a lot of that coming from DashPass buyers and subscribers. And remind me your second question again?\nPrabir Adarkar: Actually, before you move on to the second question Tony, just a couple of things to add on, Ron. I mean you're exactly right. So far, the program has been about delivering savings to consumers and that's why, because we had to start somewhere and that's probably the natural place to start. Over time now that we've got the program at scale and it's something that both merchants and consumers recognize the value and you can start layering in benefits that extend beyond just dollar savings, right. So I think of that as exclusive items the restaurants wants to market something specifically to these consumers. We can do exclusive items with DashPass. We can provide exclusive access to certain restaurants that might be more part of the way compared to restaurant that are in your vicinity. We can do segmented offerings. We launched our DashPass student plan and this is a way of billing benefits to segment of the population to make it more interesting for them. We can add selection, so that -- maybe you don't need from restaurants today and as a result, the savings opportunity isn't available to you but if we add in grocery and convenience stores, now you might have other use cases for which DashPass is actually beneficial. So there's things we can do within DashPass in order to tailor the benefit depending on who the audiences is and we're just getting started.\nTony Xu: And Ron, on your second question is actually about drive and kind of the digitization of kind of the first party experience, right? And so, you asked -- first of all, the premise is absolutely right. I mean, I think if there is any positive from COVID, it's that every physical business was effectively forced or compelled to become a digital operations almost somewhat overnight. And as a result, I think the major lesson everyone learned is that digital sales can complement their in-store business and interactivity. In fact those who have invested very aggressively in their e-commerce operations I think have really, really benefited and continue to have shown strength. And so that -- and that's what we're seeing. And in terms of the merchants demand and willingness to work with us to effectively transform their business models and to becoming digital operations. And so drive obviously has played a big part of that where it's effectively now diversified from starting with large enterprise restaurants only to now serving everyone from non-restaurants, convenience stores, pet stores, liquor stores, grocery stores, retail stores and it has a large runway, both in the U.S. as well as globally, but it also has a big runway in serving small businesses as well. And that's really why we felt in the storefront, because a lot of these small businesses aren't even able right now to have online ordering systems that will talk or seamlessly integrate into their back capacity systems. And storefront does that. And our latest products that we've introduced as part of our platform services business, actually, it was an acquisition called Bbot. That product really helps manage the in-store operations and becomes a bit of the operating system inside these restaurants. And so there is a lot of work we have to do in order to build an end-to-end system to really power the first party digital operations of these businesses, but it's an opportunity that you're absolutely right within restaurants, outside of restaurants and globally.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Boone: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. So, the first is, from the letter it feels like convenience is to starting to get the scale. The question is really what's the next category that you guys are really excited about that you think you can lean into and invest behind and kind of get to that same kind of variable contribution margin breakeven and kind of velocity? And then the second question is more bigger picture. Understood that as you guys see larger opportunities, you're investing there. But can you just remind us in terms of a framework of how you think about allowing margin expansion to flow through to the models, just overall? So how do you think about kind of growth versus profitability? Thanks so much.\nTony Xu: Hey. It's Tony. I'll take the first question and maybe Prabir can take the question on the economics and how we reinvest those back into the model. On the first, look, all of these categories are pretty enormous right, and restaurants in the U.S. is $800 billion. I mean if you looked at grocery and convenience, they add to over $1 dollars in the U.S. and outside of the US, it's much larger than that. And then if you include the other categories of pads, alcohol, pharmacy, retail, we get to an even larger number. And so, I think when the opportunity is that large, we don't think that much about which one of them is going to get there first. We instead just think about what's the right amount to invest and when to do it, right. And that really goes back to the investment philosophy that we kind of outline from how we launch businesses in the first place, which -- and this is true for all of the businesses at DoorDash whether it was the restaurant's marketplace, the platform business with products like Drive and Storefront for the convenience business, or all the -- or the ads business that we're launching and the international markets, which really is how do we build the best possible product actually meet or ideally exceed the customer expectation and keep doing that. And then how do we actually line-by-line worked down the cost so that we can achieve positive unit math before we consider to say that.\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. And on the margin flow through question, we're running the business with the objective of maximizing scale so that in the long term we maximize profit dollars, right. And so as Tony alluded to these categories that we're operating in they're very large. They are very underpenetrated today and that's why we're investing to build scale. And what we look for is this combination of strong signals of product-market fit as well as the path to attractive community count. So let me give you an example, we size in the third-party convenience example. If you look at our DashMart today and I look at all the stores on DoorDash, on any given day, the most popular stores in terms of orders off the top 10, the majority of DashMarts. That's a signal of strong product-market fit because that's the customer speaking, right, and you see that in the data. And so this -- these signals of product-market fit coupled with the others that we see and unit economics, this is what gives us confidence to continue investing because the belief is that it will lead to solid growth for many years to come. Now the core U.S. restaurant business is profitable, it's growing and the profit margins continue increasing and we're using those profits from that core business to make these investments. So said definitely, we're not trying to manage the business to increase margins or even the dollar amount of EBITDA, because we're essentially reinvesting those profits in order to grow these other areas. But to the extent we don't see the right progress, whether it's product-market fit indicators or the right progress from a margin perspective, a unique numbers perspective for these new areas. We scaled back and that's the discipline that will run the core U.S. business with after this point that allowed us to build a profitable core U.S. business. And so we will flex and adjust depending on the signals we see but the intent right now is to reinvest these profits provided the signals are there so that we can drive growth for many years to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. Tony maybe a bigger picture question. Obviously you have a bit of public company for very long and you see periods like this where valuation gets compressed very quickly and capital becomes a little bit more constrained broadly in growth industries. How are you thinking about the capital you have on the balance sheet as elements of playing often and maybe accelerated things more buy versus build decision and where you want to take the platform longer-term versus using capital as a sort of fortress to sort of shore up and think about broader industry structures over the medium to long term? I'd love your perspective on that given the broader market environment we find ourselves in. And then maybe to ask one question a little bit differently. Given the current labor environment from delivery folks, do you see companies that have been more reluctant to maybe embrace platforms? Like you either wanting to partner, either directly on the platform we're utilizing drive and we saw this in different hotel cycles with the OTAs over the years where periods of time of demand or labor constraint can lead people to make partnerships in digital. Could we see partners that have historically been reluctant to partner with you maybe come back and think about platform dynamics to fulfill their business needs? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Hey, Eric. Yes, thanks for the questions. On the first one, I think the best way to always grow is from your own cash flows, right. And that's why we're in a very privileged position where we have a very cash-generating business in our U.S. restaurants marketplace that really allow us to make most of our investments. And we also have a cash balance north of $4 billion, which to your point, gives us quite a lot of flexibility. But I think it's really important to know when to use capital to your advantage and maybe when not to use capital to your advantage. I think from a building businesses and products perspective, I think it's really important that we have to achieve product-market fit first, right, before we deploy capital to actually scale those businesses. In fact, I would argue we have the first time product-market fit and then find efficient ways to grow that are unique to that product and then consider deploying capital to very, very aggressively scale that business. And that's kind of how we think about deploying capital from an organic perspective. I think from an inorganic perspective, I think the bar is just really high right. M&A as I'm sure you know, it does not have a historical track record for success, and I think for us, we keep that bar very, very high and only really consider acting upon it if we see two things, one, obviously if it's accretive to our business in terms of giving us the advantage of investing more efficiently in an area that we find very attractive for years to come. And secondly, if we find a team that we think is not only aligned on building the same thing of the long run but how we actually build it, right. And this really is reflected in the example of Wolt, which again should close the first half of this year where we saw in their business, world-class retention and order rates metrics that show that they built a product that is best in class that's loved by really all of their audiences. And they did it with an incredibly capital efficient P&L in many geographies, including a very difficult to operating geographies. And they had a team then very similarly to how we wanted to build for the long run and what it is that we actually wanted to build. And so I think that's really how we think about making these investments whether it's organic or inorganic, but I really do think there are times where capital certainly is a privilege we have now, given the fact that we built a cash flow positive business as well as have a lot of money on the balance sheet with no debt. But when we deployed is a very, very important decision that we take seriously.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney...\nTony Xu: I'm sorry, Prabir. I'm sorry, I don't think we answered Eric's second question. Prabir, you're going to take that?\nPrabir Adarkar: Yes. The second question was really around partnerships. I mean, just given the scale of our business. now whether it's the marketplace side or in the platform of side and the fleet that we have, inside of that fleet with products such as Drive, they're getting more and more interesting, particularly in this era when the labor market state is tight. And particularly when it comes to delivery space with everyone, Tony alluded to this in an earlier question around interest and Drive, it began simply with restaurants. And now it's sort of -- it's -- all these different categories beyond restaurants that are all looking to reach customers on a same-day in fact to some hour leases. And this is particularly relevant outside of the U.S. where these options don't exist was actually unique -- it's a unique customer expense. And so we are seeing the successful drive, as well as the greater secular shift towards convenience drive and increased conversations with partners, outside of the restaurant category in different categories that are actually interested in embracing the same deployment.\nTony Xu: Yes. The only thing I'd add Eric is just that I think just as consumers are exhibiting the behavior where they're going back inside restaurants and seeing friends again and families again and eating together and they are also ordering delivery at the same time. Restaurants are noticing that too. And as a result, I think the argument of incrementality, not just in terms of incremental customers but actually incremental orders is really starting to sync in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. Could you just touch on latest thoughts on ad revenue or -- yes, over time, and I think that's still very early stages but may anything on timing. And then on the average order frequency reaching a new high, can you provide any detail on how wide of a gap you're seeing between average order frequency for people who just start and then it will become DashPassers and then they become mature? They have been on DashPass for 6 months, 12 months etc. Like how wide is that gap maybe help us think about the curve of usage in the future? Thanks a lot.\nPrabir Adarkar: Sure. Hey, Mark. On ad revenue, we haven't disclosed the size of the business, it's still young and nascent and there's a lot -- there's room to grow. Yes, I would say it is an attractive opportunity for us, just given the size of our user base, the frequency of interactions on our platform, as well as a number surfaces that are available. And we said that we've not been in a rush to monetize. Our focus -- we need to make sure we balance delivering an appropriate return to advertisers with the consumer experience. It would be a negative if consumer experience has impacted or by conversions impacted in any way. And certainly over the coming time period, I mean, as this business scales, we will use these incremental profits to invest into growth into strengthening the core U.S. business as well as our other initiatives beyond restaurants. On your question regarding order frequency, it's a tough question to answer because we're continuing to see growth across cohorts. So let's take DashPass as an example, once a user joins DashPass, over time their order frequency, so that cohort just has continued increasing. So that's spread just continues to widen. And so, I'm not trying to avoid the question, I am just trying -- it's an imprecise question. It will be a different story if these order frequencies remain static, but the reality is you've got growth taking place at the cohort level.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks guys. A couple of quick ones. DashMarts essentially the micro fulfillment centers. I think last time we checked you were carrying around 2000 SKUs. Can you talk about the kind of trajectory of growth in terms of locations or SKU base that you're running a DashMarts? Ad then, we just got back from marketing around Europe and we got asked every meeting how's the U.S. North American consumer versus European. Looking at Wolt versus North America, any dynamics to call out there with respect to the strength or the price sensitivity of the consumer geographically?\nTony Xu: Hey, Brian, it's Tony. I'll take the question on DashMart and then maybe Prabir can fall on the second question around kind of geographic differences in terms of what we're noticing. On DashMart, the way I think about this is the problem to solve isn't how many SKUs to offer inside of a DashMart or whether to build DashMart. The problem really to solve is how do we actually build the best convenience and grocery delivery experience. And when you look at where the penetration levels are today and just take for example, the U.S., relative to where they could be, I think there is a massive gap if anything the penetration levels today and convenience and grocery it's fairly low and has largely stagnated post-COVID. And I think that suggests that the customer actually prefers perhaps either buying online, picking up in-store perhaps just shopping inside the store altogether. And so what we are trying to solve is how do we build an on experience that can work from both consumers, grocers, retailers as well as Dashers. And the way we think about it is for consumers, how do we build an experience that can give them exactly what they ordered, that can do it at a price point that matches their expectations with greater convenience. And if we can figure that out, which is going to require lots of invention, such as figuring out inventory management built from the ground up as well as merchandising, getting the right SKUs and selection to the point of your question as well as doing it more conveniently, then I think that that's a service that grocers and retailers or like will like as well. And that's something that we can help them with as they think about how can they add effectively another use case to their already very successful buy online pickup in-store use case and make that incremental for them and have these warehouses that are actually optimize particularly. So that's really what we're trying to do with DashMart.\nPrabir Adarkar: And then on your international question and I know there is an in-depth at Europe but just to -- just as a point of reference, I'm not sure the price sensitivity question, to be honest with you. At least based on our analysis, if you look at outside the U.S. and if you exclude UK for a second, the levels of penetration in terms of food delivery are quite low, right, whether it's European countries, whether it's Australia, Japan or whatever. And the reason for that is because it was a couple of things, one is the number of restaurants that are available and also to selection problem first and foremost. Second, the quality of the experience is iffy. And what I mean by that is some of these countries in food delivery is essentially lead-gen, which means that it's the restaurant that actually fulfilling in the order and consumers don't have visibility into whether the order is going to be delivered, who to call to lead and that just leads to poor consumer experience that then ultimately leads to lower adoption. So I think the opportunity is there as long as we address these fundamental building blocks of selection, quality and affordability in these countries, whether it's Europe or Australia, Japan. It is very early in terms of their development along these dimensions.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the DoorDash team.\nTony Xu: Thank you, Joel. And thank you everybody for the questions and your time today. We look forward to being in touch with many of you soon. Have a good evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Prabir Adarkar",
            "content": "Yes. Hey, Ross. And just to add to that point before I move on to the second part of your question. If you recall, when we announced Wolt, one of the things that we were excited about was the unit economics and the retention. So Wolt gives us a more efficient engine through which we can invest internationally and that's why what we had communicated was even after integrating Wolt, we expect our EBITDA expectations for the year to be materially unchanged because we're essentially now redeploying capital that we would have deployed but till the Wolt engine, which is actually more efficient. So hopefully that gets to the crux of your question. On the supply question, we have not experienced supply shortages and we feel good about our supply position looking ahead. Some stats to share with you. Our Dasher costs as a percentage of GOV will be were lower both quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year. Recall -- if you recall last year in Q1, we were undersupply due to bad weather as well as fiscal stimulus and we began investing over the course of last year, as well as this quarter frankly to continue to build a supply base where we can address the demand that we had anticipated. The second point and this is a little bit of a nuanced one. Our batch rates are down both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year and this is my point to that is because in some occasions, if we find ourselves undersupply, you may see batch rates go up. As a matter of fact, we actually had lower batch rates today than we were a year ago or even last quarter. And then the last point I'll make is our cost to acquire new Dashers. So our cost to acquire renewed Dashers is the lowest it's been in the last four quarters. So all that to say, we feel really good from a supply standpoint not just because we invest in advance, in order to address this demand but because we don't compete with rideshare for Dashers. This is a completely different pool of people. Thanks for the question, Youssef. So on the Wolt question specifically, the deal is on track to close in the second quarter. We can't comment on Wolt's performance before the deal is closed but in connection with the closing of the transaction, we'll provide more detail on come back to the street good specific. So, stay tuned for that. Now, on your question on U.S. contribution margins, we haven't disclosed the exact contribution margin in the U.S. restaurant business, but let me try to answer your question in sort of qualitative terms, which is the first thing, we have driven increasing margins in the U.S. restaurant business while growing categories there. And the reason that's important is because it is easy to do one or the other, which is either grow margins outdoor category share, those remarkable progress that we've made in actually growing both. And looking into the future, there's multiple levers that are available to continue doing so without hurting growth. First, as we continue to drive up, the efficiency of the logistics network, that will help our margin structure in the U.S. Second, as we continue improving the quality of the delivery experience, that will help with customer support costs as well as the refunds. And then finally, there is leverage in certain parts of cost of sales as well as single marketing which will help the margin structure. Now beyond this as our ads business scales, this is an incremental tailwind to the margin structure. So all of these things will come together to help the margins for the U.S restaurant business grow and fund not just other things, but reinvestment in that -- in the core U.S. restaurant business. Because our objective is -- we're not running the U.S. restaurant business to harvest margins. We're still investing in U.S. restaurants in order to build scale and continue to grow category share. Yes. I mean you have to remember that these are -- it's like comparing a two-year-old to a 10-year, so it's kind of hard to compare an apples-to-apples as well. Say in a matter of two years, given that we've got line of sight to introduce breakeven unit economics in 3P convenience business is quite remarkable. And you need to pair that with the fact that we are number one in the convenience space and this is just in the matter of two years. Over time, this thing that we will do to continue driving up those margin. So I don't want to provide a forecast to where the margin structure gets to, because you got a lot and so we're right now at the walk stage. We're getting to breakeven and then in the future, we'll continue driving our margins. Today, the vast majority of the margin comes from the U.S. restaurant business, other areas are sort of in your margin consumers, so to speak, but over time as they hit maturity and start to see us generate more and more profits on these areas. Lloyd, maybe I'll take the first and Tony can take the second, Lloyd. So on the question around 3P convenience, you have to remember when we started this category, it was a -- we knew those demand for it because we saw what consumers were searching for, right, and that demand got further amplified by COVID. But what we didn't completely appreciate is exactly how different and unique the sale is compared to restaurant. And so that's the learning curve we've been on that is now going to the other side as we turn the curve and profitability. So simple things like our Dashers need to go into stores to pick and pack. We need a different way to understand the inventory positions at the store and how do we guide the Dasher when they are inside the store. The basket sizes tend to be lower. So this is where our operational to the execution focus and product focus muscle really have shown because it allowed us to take this problem that looked unique to the restaurants and actually create products around it in order to make the math work even with lower basket sizes and picking and packing requirement. So that's what I'd say. Now there is suddenly a lot more we can do in terms of for the cart up sales as well as other things including advertising attach by the way to drive up the unit economics, and we're super early given that it's only 22 years old. Doug, maybe I'll start with the first here. Our average order values have increased slightly as a result of inflation. We obviously -- we pass on the large portion of that to our merchants and so they benefit as well, given that they're experiencing price increases in the cost of the food. And all else being equal, this would also have a positive impact on our margins. Now the one thing I'll say is, the reality is we've seen food cost inflation for over a year now, right, the chicken prices and other things. And so it's hard to tell exactly what impact inflation have in an order volume and in consumer engagement specifically because we don't have the counter-factual. Having said that, when we step back and you look at the results in the quarter, and the fact that monthly active users are all time highs, the fact that DashPass members are at all-time highs and order frequency is an all-time highs. It speaks to the resilience of the platform and the fact that the product has consistently gotten better and better and better in terms of selection, in terms of quality, in terms of affordability and that leads to more consumer adoption, habituation and an increasing usage over time. And then on your sector -- sorry, Tony, do you want to add something to that? And then just offer a little more color to what just Tony just described, Doug. Look we chose to absorb the costs of these Dasher benefits in order to preserve earnings and we could have chosen to pass on the cost to consumers and that would have had an impact on growth due to consumer price elasticity, but instead we chose to absorb the program costs. So let me explain why we did that. When we keep consumer prices unchanged and if we ensure the Dasher earnings are preserved, that enables us to maximize growth because having adequate supply ensures of the consumer quality is preserved which then drives the growth flywheel in a slightly different way, right. So then there is a question of, well, how do you fund it? And as Tony pointed out, the U.S. restaurant business is very profitable and we use the profits from the restaurant business for two things. First, as we previously talk about to invest in new areas, in international and so on. The second is reinvest back in the core restaurant business. So we're growing scale and generating growth in the core restaurant business. Historically, we've taken these efficiencies and we've use them to lower consumer prices, lower merchant commissions, increased DASH earnings. Today because of gas prices, there is this unique need for Dashers. And so where we're allocating more investment to actually help increase DASH earnings. If gas prices revert in the future, we'll revisit that. So in short, absorbing these costs is basically net neutral to our EBITDA expectations. Yes. Thanks, Michael. Let me take this question. Yes, so if you look back Q1 '21, so, Q1 last year was elevated in terms of customer acquisition as a result of fiscal stimulus. Ignoring that quarter, if you look at every other quarter up to Q1 '22, we acquired more customers than we did and that just speaks to the fact that we're still under-penetrated in this category and there is more customers to be acquired. And then the last thing I'll say is, the majority of our business is the restaurant business and so a lot of these customers join and place their first order on restaurant. But we're seeing an interest interesting mix change where now we've got these number of customers joining to actually use some of our other categories, not just restaurants. And so it's too early because it's a small percentage you were talking about, but over time as DoorDash gets known for being your destination for all things local commerce, the source of what product these customers use when they first joined DoorDash will undoubtedly change. So Deepak... Go ahead, Tony, I can pick up... And specifically on that Deepak, DashPass user order frequency has grown and you've also got an increase in mix towards DashPass. So those two things sort of act in concert with each other. And on your question on insurance reserves, we experienced an increase in the average claim amount driven by the outsized impact of for few very large claims. As a result, we adjusted our reserves for both for existing claims as well as the future claims by 35 million, which had about a 30 basis point impact to cost of sales. Even though the insurance cost increased, it's a relatively small portion of our cost of sales, certainly compared to other line items like payment processing or customer support and it's lower than what you might see in rideshare. And so, long saying this is an area where we haven't -- because it's been a small cost, we haven't focused on it, but it also represents an opportunity where we can -- we have begun now to put in place new processes to control these costs in the long term. Last thing I'll say is in the near term, we expect insurance costs to remain elevated in the near term because it takes a while for these changes to reflect in our claims data, but we're going to manage within the EBITDA range. And then on your question, Brian on 3P convenience and why not raise the guide. It's a small portion right now and secondly, any profits we generated as I mentioned earlier we reinvest and try to drive scale and growth so that we maximize long-term profit dollars. Actually, before you move on to the second question Tony, just a couple of things to add on, Ron. I mean you're exactly right. So far, the program has been about delivering savings to consumers and that's why, because we had to start somewhere and that's probably the natural place to start. Over time now that we've got the program at scale and it's something that both merchants and consumers recognize the value and you can start layering in benefits that extend beyond just dollar savings, right. So I think of that as exclusive items the restaurants wants to market something specifically to these consumers. We can do exclusive items with DashPass. We can provide exclusive access to certain restaurants that might be more part of the way compared to restaurant that are in your vicinity. We can do segmented offerings. We launched our DashPass student plan and this is a way of billing benefits to segment of the population to make it more interesting for them. We can add selection, so that -- maybe you don't need from restaurants today and as a result, the savings opportunity isn't available to you but if we add in grocery and convenience stores, now you might have other use cases for which DashPass is actually beneficial. So there's things we can do within DashPass in order to tailor the benefit depending on who the audiences is and we're just getting started. Yes. And on the margin flow through question, we're running the business with the objective of maximizing scale so that in the long term we maximize profit dollars, right. And so as Tony alluded to these categories that we're operating in they're very large. They are very underpenetrated today and that's why we're investing to build scale. And what we look for is this combination of strong signals of product-market fit as well as the path to attractive community count. So let me give you an example, we size in the third-party convenience example. If you look at our DashMart today and I look at all the stores on DoorDash, on any given day, the most popular stores in terms of orders off the top 10, the majority of DashMarts. That's a signal of strong product-market fit because that's the customer speaking, right, and you see that in the data. And so this -- these signals of product-market fit coupled with the others that we see and unit economics, this is what gives us confidence to continue investing because the belief is that it will lead to solid growth for many years to come. Now the core U.S. restaurant business is profitable, it's growing and the profit margins continue increasing and we're using those profits from that core business to make these investments. So said definitely, we're not trying to manage the business to increase margins or even the dollar amount of EBITDA, because we're essentially reinvesting those profits in order to grow these other areas. But to the extent we don't see the right progress, whether it's product-market fit indicators or the right progress from a margin perspective, a unique numbers perspective for these new areas. We scaled back and that's the discipline that will run the core U.S. business with after this point that allowed us to build a profitable core U.S. business. And so we will flex and adjust depending on the signals we see but the intent right now is to reinvest these profits provided the signals are there so that we can drive growth for many years to come. Yes. The second question was really around partnerships. I mean, just given the scale of our business. now whether it's the marketplace side or in the platform of side and the fleet that we have, inside of that fleet with products such as Drive, they're getting more and more interesting, particularly in this era when the labor market state is tight. And particularly when it comes to delivery space with everyone, Tony alluded to this in an earlier question around interest and Drive, it began simply with restaurants. And now it's sort of -- it's -- all these different categories beyond restaurants that are all looking to reach customers on a same-day in fact to some hour leases. And this is particularly relevant outside of the U.S. where these options don't exist was actually unique -- it's a unique customer expense. And so we are seeing the successful drive, as well as the greater secular shift towards convenience drive and increased conversations with partners, outside of the restaurant category in different categories that are actually interested in embracing the same deployment. Sure. Hey, Mark. On ad revenue, we haven't disclosed the size of the business, it's still young and nascent and there's a lot -- there's room to grow. Yes, I would say it is an attractive opportunity for us, just given the size of our user base, the frequency of interactions on our platform, as well as a number surfaces that are available. And we said that we've not been in a rush to monetize. Our focus -- we need to make sure we balance delivering an appropriate return to advertisers with the consumer experience. It would be a negative if consumer experience has impacted or by conversions impacted in any way. And certainly over the coming time period, I mean, as this business scales, we will use these incremental profits to invest into growth into strengthening the core U.S. business as well as our other initiatives beyond restaurants. On your question regarding order frequency, it's a tough question to answer because we're continuing to see growth across cohorts. So let's take DashPass as an example, once a user joins DashPass, over time their order frequency, so that cohort just has continued increasing. So that's spread just continues to widen. And so, I'm not trying to avoid the question, I am just trying -- it's an imprecise question. It will be a different story if these order frequencies remain static, but the reality is you've got growth taking place at the cohort level. And then on your international question and I know there is an in-depth at Europe but just to -- just as a point of reference, I'm not sure the price sensitivity question, to be honest with you. At least based on our analysis, if you look at outside the U.S. and if you exclude UK for a second, the levels of penetration in terms of food delivery are quite low, right, whether it's European countries, whether it's Australia, Japan or whatever. And the reason for that is because it was a couple of things, one is the number of restaurants that are available and also to selection problem first and foremost. Second, the quality of the experience is iffy.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Hi, Ross, it's Tony. I'll take the first one and I'll let Prabir take the second one. So on the first one, well, I would say two parts. First is just our investment strategy with Wolt, and then secondly just our investment philosophy in general. Our aspiration is to build the largest global, local commerce business and we want to do that with building two assets. We want to build the largest local commerce marketplace where we're bringing everything inside the neighborhood to you and we also want to build the largest local commerce platform where we're giving tools to the physical businesses so that they each can become their own digital powerhouses and that's really why we're excited about teaming up with the Wolt because they share that same vision to build that truly global local commerce business as well. And from our perspective, it's really going to take a similar investment philosophy in terms of how we've built everything else. So in the investments shareholder letter, we gave an example of how we built effectively a new business from scratch in the last couple of years in the convenience category and kind of outline how we always start by first making sure that we build the best product possible especially measure in terms of retention order frequency. We have a maniacal focus on the unit math to get the unit economics to work, and then we start considering efficient ways to actually scale that business. So while we are aggressive in how we run these experiments to be able to achieve those input outcomes, we're very disciplined about how we think about how to scale these businesses. And it's going to be no different as we think about the opportunity to team up with Wolt. We think the opportunity obviously is immense. I mean if you look at this opportunity globally, in the restaurants category, in the U.S. we're even as the market leader only 6% of total restaurant industry sales. If you extend that into these other categories of restaurants or convenience or retail we're significantly smaller percentage. If we add in the countries now with Wolt, adds on top of that which gets us to a combined portfolio of about 26 countries, we're almost on an unnoticeable percentage. And then even if you combine -- and then if you add on top of that digitization that's happening on the merchants websites and apps themselves, many of which we power through products like DoorDash Drive and Storefront, as well as other products. We're in the early ascendings but the investment philosophy remains the same, where there is a maniacal focus on building the best-in-class products, a maniacal focus on getting laser sharp on the unit map so that's actually positive before we scale globally. Yes. I think the only other thing I'd add before I take the question, Lloyd on hiring is just, I think it's important to realize, especially when you're talking about the immense opportunity in something like convenience or grocery, which is a hundreds of billions of dollars more than a trillion-dollar opportunity globally. It's a very long runway in terms of how we think about this. To be -- Canada was very impressed by how our teams were able to do all the things that Prabir said and on top of that build a new catalog that is item based, that has tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of items per store instead of hundreds of items inside of a restaurant and we rebuilt search into an item based experience first before a store based experience. I mean there's a lot of things that the team built and they were able in parallel to move the unit economics. And I think it's just -- it's a huge testament to the team in terms of the work that they did in both moving at the top and the bottom line of building a better product that customers would be using over, and again, and then also making moves on the profitability front. On hiring, I guess the first thing I would say is, you've got to be careful with what you read because it's probably either not in context or just not accurate. We're hiring at actually still very aggressive rates, multiples in fact of what I believe has been reported. But in general, let me talk a little bit about hiring maybe in the context of just our investment philosophy because it's very similar. If you look at the history of DoorDash or how perhaps sort of where we came from and maybe how we have enabled this continuous efficient process of inventing and in a disciplined way of scaling the business. It really came from the fact that we had a lot of constraints early on in the business. I mean, for the first six to 6.5 years of the business, we had a fraction of the financing of some of our peers. And so there is no ability to hire huge teams or spend a lot on marketing spend anything on discounts or subsidies. We had to invent and win by building a superior product, gain profitability in the right way is not by doing unnatural things that hurt the customer experience but by doing the things that would increase selection, that would improve the service quality of our deliveries, that would offer more value in the form of DashPass and other programs and improve our customer support. And all of these things is what led us to have industry-leading retention, which has yielded I think some of the numbers that we've shown in the shareholder letter, all-time highs and our monthly active users even as thankfully customers are now finally returning back inside restaurants. All-time highs and our DashPass subscriber base, all-time highs in our order frequency across cohorts. So building the best product as well as gaining efficiencies from operations and the scale economies from marketing, that's really how the business has been built. Now when I apply that same investment philosophy towards something like hiring, it can't just be -- to hire aggressively, it has to also be to invest in systems of how we can reapply systems that we've built for one category and make that a lot, give us leverage into categories, B, C, D, E or F. And all of these ways of how we actually architect a system designed towards building the best customer experience and having the most efficient P&L. Yes. So, Doug, I'll just -- I think your question has also foreseen any behavior on the merchant and the Dash on front. I would say a couple of things. Inflation is definitely a concern, we certainly are taking very seriously, and we're doing that by making sure that all of our audiences are taken care of first. And that -- and one of the things we've been fortunate to see, I'll echo a little bit of what Prabir said and then I'll take your question on merchants and Dashers which is, it's just the resiliency of the core business of U.S. restaurants where I think it's because when I take a look at all the possible areas where consumers could spend and consume, eating is still be one of the largest and certainly the highest frequency categories where people eat three times a day, 90 times a month. If you start looking at some of the other categories we now participate in, that's well over 100 shopping occasions per month. And when we have built the largest marketplace with the most retained and also the most engaged user base, it just gives us the most shots on goal in the face of something like inflation. And when they translate that into our other two audience the, merchants and Dashers. Merchants, they continue to see DoorDash as a way to actually gain sales, even though consumers are going inside their stores, which is fantastic. And that's because dining in is very complementary to actually order and delivery. I mean when you're dining in you're looking for that experience to maybe see people you haven't seen in a while in person and that's very complementary to order and delivery, because again you eat multiple times a day, 20 to 25 times a week. And then on the Dasher front, what we've done is we definitely recognize that inflation is impacting Dasher earnings and that's really what we want to the software. It was the right thing for us to do, given that we had a very fortunate position of having a U.S. restaurants business that's not only grown 250% over the last couple of years but that have materially also increased its profitability such that we can choose to reinvest those cash flows into serving all of audiences and that's what we did. We gave out two programs, one was a 10% cashback on fuel expenses and the other was a bonus program that was tied to the distance in which Dashers would be driving. And the results so far have been very, very satisfying where 90% of Dashers are really, really excited about the benefits that we have offered so far. Deepak. Yes. I'll take the first question, Deepak, and then Prabir will handle the question on insurance. The reasons for the frequency gains are really coming from the improvements in our product. I mean there is certainly in parts some of the order frequency gains came from increasing contributions from our DashPass subscriber base. But if you -- when you step back, I think a couple of points still are very, very important. Number one, dine-in and order and delivery are very complementary. In fact, we saw this at almost every phase of the pandemic. There were various geographies and various parts of the world, including the U.S. where certain states had reopened more aggressively perhaps than some others where we saw that in the past couple of years and certainly we're still seeing that in the first quarter of this year and even currently, where people are not substituting eating in with eating out. The second point I would say is, we're constantly making improvements to the products. So we're constantly increasing inflection whether that's restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacy stores, alcohol stores, retail stores, et cetera, we're increasing the quality of the deliveries by maniacally getting rid of defects. We are improving affordability part of which is coming from DashPass and we're continuously investing in customer support to make sure that we always can delight customers and meet their increasing expectations. So that's really why our the frequencies are gone. Yes. Hi, Brian. There is still a large room to go in terms of finding more and more efficiency and really there's kind of two general ways I think about these. The first is, how do we just find the next level of product-market fit, which certainly would grow our retention and order frequency even further, thereby give us even more leverage on the sales and marketing side of the P&L, overall P&L. And then the second is really efficiency from operations. Take for example the wait times we still see at stores, I mean especially given some of the labor challenges that you're seeing at, whether it's restaurants or whether it's grocery stores or convenience stores, everyone in the service industry is certainly feeling this. That makes wait times as well as inventory management have higher variance. Being able to manage that variance and being able to lower those wait times and increase or improve the efficiency I should say, the inventory management, I think are all areas. But really you can find efficiency in every line item. And -- but the two general approaches, I generally think that this is how do we build the next level of product such that our consumers love it even more, which gives us lots of sales and marketing leverage. And then on the other side, it's really finding efficiency on the cost front. Sure. I can start and feel free Prabir if you want to chime in on some of these. But I think the first question around DashPass and value, kind of take us in two parts. One part, you kind of answered I think in your question, which really came to the foreign state, right. And I think that makes a lot of sense, especially for users that are discovering our product multiple times a month or possibly multiple times a week. I think we'll continue to make those investments. But the other thing I would say is that we also want to improve the product for DashPass itself by making sure that we can offer either exclusive or preferred types of product experiences that are only made available through DashPass as well as the fact that we're introducing so many more categories. I know that overall customers who ordered and who are ordering outside of our restaurants category the last number we announced was 14% in Q4, but in certain markets that number is much, much higher than that and you see a lot of that coming from DashPass buyers and subscribers. And remind me your second question again? And Ron, on your second question is actually about drive and kind of the digitization of kind of the first party experience, right? And so, you asked -- first of all, the premise is absolutely right. I mean, I think if there is any positive from COVID, it's that every physical business was effectively forced or compelled to become a digital operations almost somewhat overnight. And as a result, I think the major lesson everyone learned is that digital sales can complement their in-store business and interactivity. In fact those who have invested very aggressively in their e-commerce operations I think have really, really benefited and continue to have shown strength. And so that -- and that's what we're seeing. And in terms of the merchants demand and willingness to work with us to effectively transform their business models and to becoming digital operations. And so drive obviously has played a big part of that where it's effectively now diversified from starting with large enterprise restaurants only to now serving everyone from non-restaurants, convenience stores, pet stores, liquor stores, grocery stores, retail stores and it has a large runway, both in the U.S. as well as globally, but it also has a big runway in serving small businesses as well. And that's really why we felt in the storefront, because a lot of these small businesses aren't even able right now to have online ordering systems that will talk or seamlessly integrate into their back capacity systems. And storefront does that. And our latest products that we've introduced as part of our platform services business, actually, it was an acquisition called Bbot. That product really helps manage the in-store operations and becomes a bit of the operating system inside these restaurants. And so there is a lot of work we have to do in order to build an end-to-end system to really power the first party digital operations of these businesses, but it's an opportunity that you're absolutely right within restaurants, outside of restaurants and globally. Hey. It's Tony. I'll take the first question and maybe Prabir can take the question on the economics and how we reinvest those back into the model. On the first, look, all of these categories are pretty enormous right, and restaurants in the U.S. is $800 billion. I mean if you looked at grocery and convenience, they add to over $1 dollars in the U.S. and outside of the US, it's much larger than that. And then if you include the other categories of pads, alcohol, pharmacy, retail, we get to an even larger number. And so, I think when the opportunity is that large, we don't think that much about which one of them is going to get there first. We instead just think about what's the right amount to invest and when to do it, right. And that really goes back to the investment philosophy that we kind of outline from how we launch businesses in the first place, which -- and this is true for all of the businesses at DoorDash whether it was the restaurant's marketplace, the platform business with products like Drive and Storefront for the convenience business, or all the -- or the ads business that we're launching and the international markets, which really is how do we build the best possible product actually meet or ideally exceed the customer expectation and keep doing that. And then how do we actually line-by-line worked down the cost so that we can achieve positive unit math before we consider to say that. Hey, Eric. Yes, thanks for the questions. On the first one, I think the best way to always grow is from your own cash flows, right. And that's why we're in a very privileged position where we have a very cash-generating business in our U.S. restaurants marketplace that really allow us to make most of our investments. And we also have a cash balance north of $4 billion, which to your point, gives us quite a lot of flexibility. But I think it's really important to know when to use capital to your advantage and maybe when not to use capital to your advantage. I think from a building businesses and products perspective, I think it's really important that we have to achieve product-market fit first, right, before we deploy capital to actually scale those businesses. In fact, I would argue we have the first time product-market fit and then find efficient ways to grow that are unique to that product and then consider deploying capital to very, very aggressively scale that business. And that's kind of how we think about deploying capital from an organic perspective. I think from an inorganic perspective, I think the bar is just really high right. M&A as I'm sure you know, it does not have a historical track record for success, and I think for us, we keep that bar very, very high and only really consider acting upon it if we see two things, one, obviously if it's accretive to our business in terms of giving us the advantage of investing more efficiently in an area that we find very attractive for years to come. And secondly, if we find a team that we think is not only aligned on building the same thing of the long run but how we actually build it, right. And this really is reflected in the example of Wolt, which again should close the first half of this year where we saw in their business, world-class retention and order rates metrics that show that they built a product that is best in class that's loved by really all of their audiences. And they did it with an incredibly capital efficient P&L in many geographies, including a very difficult to operating geographies. And they had a team then very similarly to how we wanted to build for the long run and what it is that we actually wanted to build. And so I think that's really how we think about making these investments whether it's organic or inorganic, but I really do think there are times where capital certainly is a privilege we have now, given the fact that we built a cash flow positive business as well as have a lot of money on the balance sheet with no debt. But when we deployed is a very, very important decision that we take seriously. I'm sorry, Prabir. I'm sorry, I don't think we answered Eric's second question. Prabir, you're going to take that? Yes. The only thing I'd add Eric is just that I think just as consumers are exhibiting the behavior where they're going back inside restaurants and seeing friends again and families again and eating together and they are also ordering delivery at the same time. Restaurants are noticing that too. And as a result, I think the argument of incrementality, not just in terms of incremental customers but actually incremental orders is really starting to sync in. Hey, Brian, it's Tony. I'll take the question on DashMart and then maybe Prabir can fall on the second question around kind of geographic differences in terms of what we're noticing. On DashMart, the way I think about this is the problem to solve isn't how many SKUs to offer inside of a DashMart or whether to build DashMart. The problem really to solve is how do we actually build the best convenience and grocery delivery experience. And when you look at where the penetration levels are today and just take for example, the U.S., relative to where they could be, I think there is a massive gap if anything the penetration levels today and convenience and grocery it's fairly low and has largely stagnated post-COVID. And I think that suggests that the customer actually prefers perhaps either buying online, picking up in-store perhaps just shopping inside the store altogether. And so what we are trying to solve is how do we build an on experience that can work from both consumers, grocers, retailers as well as Dashers. And the way we think about it is for consumers, how do we build an experience that can give them exactly what they ordered, that can do it at a price point that matches their expectations with greater convenience. And if we can figure that out, which is going to require lots of invention, such as figuring out inventory management built from the ground up as well as merchandising, getting the right SKUs and selection to the point of your question as well as doing it more conveniently, then I think that that's a service that grocers and retailers or like will like as well. And that's something that we can help them with as they think about how can they add effectively another use case to their already very successful buy online pickup in-store use case and make that incremental for them and have these warehouses that are actually optimize particularly. So that's really what we're trying to do with DashMart. Thank you, Joel. And thank you everybody for the questions and your time today. We look forward to being in touch with many of you soon. Have a good evening."

Many of these uncertainties are described in our SEC filings, including Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our earnings release, which is available on our IR website. These non-GAAP measures should not -- should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call is being audio webcasted on our IR website. An audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. Mandy, we'll pass it back to you, and we can take our first question.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Morton with Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead. \nMichael Morton : Hi, good evening. Thanks for the question. First one for Tony. And then a second one for Ravi. Tony, I would love to hear your thoughts on what you think the future structure of the grocery market looks like. As order density increases on a store level, some industry participants think you might see more growth in the merchant picked model and also like consumers demand more speed. That kind of plays to your advantage with the Dashers. Would love to see how you see that evolving? And then for Ravi, we get a lot of investor questions on the ability to leverage sales and marketing on a per order basis. It seems like it might have slowed down just a tad in the fourth quarter and then looking at the forward guide. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunity to continue to leverage sales and marketing? Thank you.\nTony Xu : Hey, Michael, it's Tony. Regarding your question on grocery, I think it really depends on what it is that you're trying to build in terms of for the customer. I mean if you think about it, a customer is going to evaluate across several dimensions. They're going to evaluate what grocers they can order from how good the order quality is in terms of if they order ex items, do they get exactly of those ex items, the affordability of the service and obviously, what happens with customer support, especially if things don't go perfectly.  And so we're always judged on those dimensions, and we're always building initiatives towards that. And a lot of this is still really nascent. If you think about DoorDash's entry into the grocery space, which happened about three years ago, we really started by nailing this top-up use case, where we're solving the middle of the week run and delivering the items that are consumed the most often, your berries, your dairy products, your cereals, your coffee, et cetera. All of that was done in concert with fantastic grocers.  We're now shifting a lot of the work towards solving bigger baskets. And so that is just solving for a different use case for the consumer. And I think we're also going to have to do other things, too, because when I just look at the structure of grocery, most of the behavior for consumers still happens off-line where consumers are purchasing groceries inside physical stores. And so that tells me that we still have -- as an industry, a long ways to go to getting a product good enough such that it can replace the offline experience. All of this is going to be done in concert with grocers. And again, it's this kind of continuum of where we want to make sure that we can solve for more than just one dimension. Speed is one of those things, but there's going to be other factors that we have to get right as well.\nRavi Inukonda : Hey, Michael, on the second point on sales and marketing, right? I'll break it into two parts. First, we'll talk about the Q3 to Q4 and then talk about the forward looking, what we expect in 2024. Q3 to Q4, we did generate leverage on consumer acquisition. The change that you're seeing is largely related to Dasher acquisition. That was purely to support the higher growth that we saw in as well as, as you know, there's some seasonal effect from a Dasher acquisition cost in Q4 in order for us to be able to continue to supply to the volumes that we had in Q4. As I look at it, right, when I think about overall leverage from a sales and marketing perspective, two frameworks here. One is we are trying to maximize sort of like payback periods, and our goal is to continue to be within the payback period. You're not looking at the absolute level of dollar investment. We're still within the payback periods on the consumer side. We are still acquiring a healthy level of consumers. Over half of the new consumers in the U.S. today start their journey with DoorDash. So that's going to be a continued way for us to continue to drive growth. On the second one, when I think about overall leverage, it purely starts from product. What you've done -- we've done in the last year or so is we've continued to drive improvements in the product, whether it's on the dasher side or the consumer side that ultimately improves retention. As the retention goes up, you'll start to see benefits from an overall sales and marketing perspective also.  So when I look at 2024, we do expect to generate leverage from an overall sales and marketing.\nMichael Morton : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devani with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nNikhil Devani: Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. I had a couple, please, on the '24 outlook. So first off, on the GOV guidance, it looks like you're calling for a few points of deceleration, Q4 into Q1 and then for the year more broadly. So could you please talk about what you might be seeing in the business that's driving that outlook? Is that a reflection of the core U.S. marketplace in restaurants or a trend that you're consistently seeing across segments? And then for my second question, on the EBITDA outlook for the year, I think the letter mentioned a ramp in margins in the back half of '24. So is this something you can call out, Ravi, on maybe specific investments that you might be leaning harder into in the first half. Just wondering what drives the comfort and visibility into more meaningful margin improvement in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nRavi Inukonda : Yeah, Nikhil, I'll take both of those, right? On the first one on the growth point, I mean, just to back up a minute, right, our goal is to grow as fast as we can within the disciplined parameters that we've set for ourselves. I mean, look, we've been public for three years now. We've driven consistently strong growth every single quarter.  What you're seeing in the business is even at our scale, if you look at our overall MAUs, they're growing at a double-digit rate. We've hit $37 million, which is an all-time record for us. Even order frequency continues to grow. When I look at the opportunity either on the users or the order frequency side, the users that are active on the platform are still a small portion of everybody who's used the app at least once in the last year. That just goes to show you the breadth of the opportunity ahead of us. Similarly, on the order frequency side, I mean, the blended order frequency is still very low compared to the number of usable movements we have, especially if you think about all the categories that we are adding in the business. What you're seeing in the business is that we are continuing to drive selection as we're making the product more affordable as the quality continues to increase. You're seeing that strength come through, whether it's retention or order frequency, both are continuing to grow. Our goal is as long as we continue to make the product better, I'm very confident that we're going to be able to drive strong growth across restaurants, new verticals as well as international. And to the second point around EBITDA, again, look, Nikhil, I mean, we've been very pleased with the performance of the business. We've scaled profitability quite nicely if you look at it over the last couple of years. What you saw in '23 is a few things, right? We have generated volume improvements through the course of the year. We have driven unit economic improvements across all major lines of business.  When you put those two together, you saw the second half EBITDA being higher than the first EBITDA, which is very similar to what we saw in the prior year in '22 as well. When I look at '24, I would expect the trend to be very similar, where the second half EBITDA is going to be higher than the first half EBITDA. But more importantly, our philosophy is we're going to operate the business with the same level of rigor and discipline with the goal being trying to drive durable growth and at the same time, improve the profitability of the business. And to the specific factors around first half versus the second half, we are investing in the first half. I mean the investments are, we are seeing strength in restaurants, we're seeing strength in new verticals, we're seeing strengthening on our national business. You can see that in the results, both from a growth as well as a profitability perspective. I do expect those investments to generate leverage in the second half. And secondly, if you have volume continuing to scale, plus the unit economics continuing to improve, you're going to see more of the EBITDA in the second half versus the first half. And even from a margin perspective, I would expect the second half margin to be higher than first half as well as the full year. But just to pull back a minute, right, I'm very pleased with the full year guide for EBITDA because, a, we are driving margin improvement; and b, we are driving overall profitability improvement quite considerably.\nNikhil Devani: Thanks, Ravi. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDeepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Tony, I wanted to see if you can elaborate on the key areas of investments inside international and new verticals, maybe in terms of countries and products. As you kind of scale these efforts, how should we think about the contribution margin curve of these initiatives versus what you saw in maybe the core restaurant business or even the convenience business over the last three to four years? And then maybe one for Ravi. On 4Q EBITDA, I know you don't always aim to beat the high end of the guidance consistently. Did you observe any sort of change in the margin trajectory of the business? Or anything you would call out as maybe one or two initiatives that drove investments higher during the quarter, perhaps in the last couple of months? Thanks so much.\nTony Xu : Hey, Deepak, it's Tony. I'll take the first one, which is about investing into international and also into new verticals. So on international, we really are investing across the board with a fairly similar framework, which is really finding product market fit and then finding an efficient way to grow. And in certain markets, it's more about the former. And the majority of markets is more about the latter. But there are markets that are younger in the portfolio.  I mean, I would say, across the board, the penetration levels in terms of our coverage of consumers as well as the merchants that we have remaining to serve is still quite low, certainly lower than where we are in the U.S., but even lower, I would say, to where they can be given the runway that we see. So it's really about making sure that we're efficient and disciplined in investing across whether we are in search of product market fit and improving that or whether we are scaling that quite nicely, in which case you see both an improvement in growth retention as well as unit economics. On the new vertical side, I mean, I think this has been just yet another quarter of continued strength. I mean, the growth on a bigger base has accelerated now three quarters in a row. That's really coming from across the board, investments into grocery, the convenience category, DashMarts, retail. So really, we're seeing improvements in growth, retention, unit economics across all major lines within our investment areas.  There's lots of work -- so I don't -- that would probably take much more than the hour to discuss with respect to products that we're working on. But all of them are trying to better the selection that we offer, the quality of the service, the affordability of the service and the customer support levels.\nRavi Inukonda : Hey, Deepak, it's Ravi. I'll extend Tony start on the first question, and then I'll take the second question, right? Like we -- to your point around margins across the investment areas. What we're seeing in the business is really strong performance, not just across growth, but when I look at the unit economics, there's been a material step function change improvement, both on the new vertical side as well as the international side. And to your specific question on the contribution margin, if I look at the basket of our overall international business, there are several countries where the core restaurant business is actually contribution margin positive and still a lot of runway for both growth as well as improvement in the margin structure. And your second point, Deepak, around Q4. Again, I mean the performance was great, right, like nothing specific that we would call out. What you're seeing is volume continuing to grow. In fact, new verticals, the volume actually accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3. Grocery was a bright spot where grocery volume also accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3. International volume continues to be very strong, and we're also seeing unit economic improvement. That's basically what drove the performance both on the top line as well as the bottom line in Q4.\nDeepak Mathivanan : Thanks so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nBernard McTernan : Great. Thanks for taking questions. Maybe just to start the New York City minimum wage. I saw you guys put through some price increases. Just wondering how you expect it to impact 1Q and the year. And then if our math is right, I think you guys added 5 million DashPass subs in '22, 3 million in '23, over the next year or two or maybe a couple of years, how big do you think DashPass can get -- and any commentary on early benefits of Wolt+ if it's been a contributor to the base?\nTony Xu : Sure. Bernie, it's Tony. I'll start and feel free to chime in, Ravi. First question is on regulation. I mean, by enlarge, the way we see the landscape is fairly similar to how we've seen it every year in the 10 years that we've been building DoorDash, which is most governments that we work with want to actually work with us and want to work with business. And they understand that in order for something like DoorDash to work, it has to work for all audiences. We're always trying to keep the most affordable prices for consumers. We want to maximize the sales for local businesses, and we want to offer the most number of work opportunities for Dashers.  The vast, vast, vast majority of places that we operate in work this way. I think there are a handful of markets, one of which you called out, New York City, that kind of takes policies to the extreme. And I think has had some adverse impacts against its wishes, which is whenever you see regulation enter the way it does in a place like New York City, what you see is cost rise for the overall system. So there are -- there's less accessibility to consumers, to your point about rising costs. There are lower sales for local businesses, and there are fewer work opportunities for Dashers.  And we largely expect that the vast, vast majority of cities will be fairly central in terms of how they think about working together with companies like ourselves. But there are a handful of markets in which have taken extreme policies. We don't expect that to change much in terms of the financial impact, all of that is reflected in our guidance. I think your second question was around DashPass. I mean, DashPass had a great year. I mean it was a record year in terms of its membership as well as the order frequency that we saw with DashPass subscribers. This includes Wolt+ as well. In fact, internationally, we actually saw the members for DashPass and Wolt+ double in the quarter. And so we're certainly seeing quite a lot of strength there. I mean the way I think about it is, I mean, there's 100 possible use cases per month for every consumer in terms of the categories and their consumption, whether that's eating or buying in retail.  Even for our best customers and certainly for the average subscriber, we're just a fraction of those use cases. So when I think about the runway, I think it's quite far. And if we can certainly serve every use case for local commerce, I think the subscriber base would be fairly healthy.\nRavi Inukonda : Hey, Bernie, it's Ravi. I'll just add to Tony's point around New York City. As you can see from the Q1 EBITDA guide, we are absorbing some of the regulatory costs in Q1. I do expect that to ramp down as we ramp up efficiency as well as we take other actions in the marketplace.  And to your second point around impact on volume, again, it's a small portion of the overall volume in the business. So I would expect the impact on volume to be very minimal.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Boone : Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to the investments in international new verticals and better understand tactically what you guys are doing. Is the investments around improving selection? Is it on the consumer DASH or such? Just help us understand more directly what exactly it is that you're doing?  And then in the press release, you called out increased first-party distribution costs for COGS. Can you just talk about where you are with DashMarts and their progress towards profitability overall? Thanks so much.\nTony Xu : Hey, Andrew, I mean, I think you pretty much answered the question yourself, which is -- I mean we're investing in all the dimensions in which a consumer judges us, right? So we're adding selection to the platform. We've launched a lot of awesome retailers over 2023. Even this year, we launched with Ahold most recently here in the U.S. We're certainly helping to improve the affordability of the service, and there's lots of work to do there. We are working on improving the quality of the service. I mean I think the hardest challenge that every grocer faces, whether it's physically or digitally in terms of sales is knowing how much inventory they have on the shelves.  And that is one of the biggest reasons in terms of why sometimes consumers prefer to go and shop inside stores. And customer support is always something that we're trying to get better. And when I look internationally, I mean, it's similar, but it's across more categories. It's not just new verticals or retail, it's also across the restaurant sector. We're just a lot earlier there in terms of the penetration levels. We have a lot more places we have to launch. We have a lot more restaurants and retailers we have to sign up. We have a lot more work to do in terms of launching our subscription programs in the countries. I mean they've seen great adoption so far, but we're very early in terms of the launch.  And then we always have to make sure that we can make the product better.\nRavi Inukonda : Yeah, Andrew, I'll take the second question around DashMart. I mean look, we're really happy with where the footprint is. We've expanded the footprint a couple of years ago, just to make sure we have the volume density across all the markets that we operate in. Today, our focus continues to be driving same-store sales growth by better merchandising, continue to improve the overall product market fit. We have both retention as well as order frequency.  When you look at the performance of the business, I mean, we're really pleased. It's doing well compared to plan. Our goal is to continue to improve, a, both the volume in that business as well as continuing to drive unit economic improvement where we've seen material improvement compared to last year. As I look at 2024, our priority is going to be continue to keep the existing footprint while increasing volume as well as driving unit economics in that business.\nAndrew Boone : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Novak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, Tony, on sort of prioritization of investments. I know you're very data-driven. And so when you sort of look at the grocery and new verticals, you -- you talked in the letter about adding more merchants, more seamless wording experiences, execution, pricing. When you sort of study the data, what is holding back adoption or driving churn or any of the negative you don't want to see. Where are sort of the pinch points you really want to solve first to try to continue to drive some strong grocery adoption in 2024? And the second one, Ravi, to go back to one of your earlier answers, we talked about, you called a step change function on new vertical unit economics. Just any color on sort of which of the areas of the business in the blocking attack in sort of drove that step change improvement in unit economics in the year? Thanks. \nTony Xu : Hey, Brian, with respect to all of the barriers to adoption, I think there are a few, but I would start by saying that things in general are going pretty well. I mean we have over 20% of customers ordering in the non-restaurants category for the first time. I mean we're now north of 100,000 plus stores that are outside of restaurants that are on our platform, which we estimate to be the largest in North America. More and more grocers, retailers are coming inbound, and then similarly, more and more consumers are shopping for the first time in the grocery category on DoorDash even ahead of restaurants. So I think there's a lot of goodness to see. And if you think about what that's centered on, that's really been centered on the fact that we launched with this top of use case, which we effectively had to invent, if you think about it. People knew DoorDash really as a place to get lunch and dinner very quickly. And so we launched this product where you can get your middle of the week run done as fast as possible.  When you run out of eggs or cereal or your berries that usually isn't like the most fulfilling trip to go inside a physical store yourself. But it's also something you want to be done quickly. And so that's something that we've solved pretty well. At the same time, I think there are a lot of barriers. I mean, if you just pan out and look at the industry, I mean, digital sales or e-commerce penetration of grocery is still amongst the lowest, if not the lowest across all categories of e-commerce.  And I think there's many reasons. First is how do you make sure that you can get exactly what a customer wants delivered to their home. I mean if you look at one of the challenges that grocers have, whether it's through their physical stores or their online channels, it's not knowing how much inventory that they actually carry. There's other barriers around affordability. I think customers largely expect to pay similar to what they pay inside the store when they get something delivered. And when you look at selection, that's something that we're just working towards. I mean it's happening actually pretty rapidly and consistently where three years ago, when we just launched our service. We were working with maybe a couple of dozen of retailers now that's in the hundreds with hundreds of thousands of stores. So that remains a thing. And I think the final thing is that it's just going to take a bit of time. I mean, I think most people in the country or in the world know DoorDash and Wolt has a place to get lunch or dinner delivered. I think it takes some time to get everyone to know that you can get your city delivered. We've certainly made a priority bet on grocery. I think it's paid off really well. I mean we see it every day in the numbers in terms of growth, retention as well as improvements in unit economics. But look, it's a long ways to go. I mean, we're three years into it where we went from zero to multibillion, which we're excited about, but I think it's just the beginning.\nRavi Inukonda : Hey, Brian. On the second one, right, in terms of the step function change and improvement in unit economics, I'll start off by saying, like in these businesses that we operate, one of the more important things is scale. Because ultimately, scale as we saw in the restaurant business, that drives volume growth, which ultimately drives efficiency in the business.  If you combine that with the overall platform density that we have, whether it's quality where we're able to accrue benefits across the platform on improvements in credits and refunds or the dasher side efficiency. All of that is driving the improvements you're seeing in the unit economic improvement across both restaurants and honestly, across all parts of the new verticals portfolio. And there's many parts of the P&L that we are driving efficiency across the board. And the second dimension I would give you is when you think about the portfolio and break it apart, right, third-party convenience, we've talked about the fact that, that was unit economic breakeven a few -- several quarters ago. That business has continued to grow as well as improve in overall unit economics. Growth, we are seeing something very similar where the overall unit economics have continued to improve.  Look, I mean, I realize there's a question if these businesses are going to be profitable for us. But when I look at the data, I have no doubt in my mind that all parts of our new vertical business is going to be profitable overtime. But again, it's important to remember, we are still very early in the journey. We're seeing great signals across growth in volume. You saw that in Q4 where the business accelerated as well as growth in unit economics.  So our goal is to continue to invest because that will ultimately drive the free cash flow generation in the business.\nBrian Nowak : Great. Thank you, both. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nJames Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My question is mostly on grocery business. And maybe, Tony, can you lay out the plan or how you try to explain -- how you plan to expand the supply of grocers going forward? And what does that process maybe entail? Do you need to hire more salespeople? Maybe system integration to retailers? And also give a sense at what point can you get to the same size as your largest competitor? Thanks.\nTony Xu : Hey, James, yeah, I mean I would say that getting supply of grocers onto the platform has not been an issue for us. I mean, it's actually gone really well and really quickly. I mean if you asked me three years ago, do -- would we have thought that we would be north of 100,000 stores in North America from close to zero? I'm not sure. And if you ask me whether or not that we would have over 20% of customers ordering outside of restaurants. I'm not sure. And I think if you asked me, would these things continue to grow as quickly as they have. I'm also not sure.  And I think one of the reasons why it's been fairly straightforward in terms of onboarding these grocers is that they see in DoorDash, the largest local commerce base of users that are shopping with the greatest frequency, which means it's very highly incremental. I mean they've seen that with each grocer that we work with we conduct incrementality tests that continue to show that DoorDash is just adding more and more sales for them and also, frankly, solving new use cases that they had previously saw.  And I think they also see in DoorDash, a partner that they can build with decades or centuries into the future.\nJames Lee : Right. Tony, I can add on here. I think last time you talked about in terms of grocery in the app, you tried to improve the user experience, make it more seamless, that will help you to improve the fill rate and substitution rate. Any update on that specifically?\nTony Xu : Yeah, it's gone really well. I mean, I think the results kind of speak for themselves. I mean, we now acquire more customers than any other platform who shop in the convenience or grocery or alcohol segments than anyone else. I think we cited in Q3 that our grocery business is growing triple digits, which I think when you compare to peers suggest that we're outpacing by many multiples. So I think the numbers kind of speak for themselves. \nJames Lee : Awesome. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney : Hey. I just want to ask about DashPass and Wolt+ members. When you think about the growth of that program going forward, this is a great customer retention, customer engagement tool. What are the things you can do to further accelerate the adoption of DashPass? Is it -- do you find it -- is it more features and functionality? Is it more competitive pricing or lower pricing? What is it that allows that subscriber base to double in the space of a couple of years. What do you think are the most interesting missing features today? Thank you.\nTony Xu : Hey, Mark, it's Tony. Well, I mean, I think there's a few things here with respect to membership adoption. I think the first is just making sure that members are aware of the savings that they're actually receiving. I think if you think about DoorDash, we have within our own ecosystem, hundreds of millions of customers who've ordered with us. But as you saw, we wrote in our shareholder letter that we have 37 million monthly active customers. And so there's a pretty large base who I think we have to meet them where they are in terms of their usage behavior and then make them aware of the possible savings that there could be. So I think thing number one -- job number one is really making sure that we can make all customers within the DoorDash and bulk ecosystem to understand the savings that they would be receiving. I think job number two is always increasing the value that members receive. And so that's something that we're always working towards and we'll add more and more benefits overtime.\nMark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Tony. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth : Thanks so much for taking question. Tony, you highlighted 7 million Dashers in '23. And it was good to see some of the details from the 4Q Dasher survey. Can you just talk to us about current Dasher supply levels and how you're feeling about Dasher satisfaction and then also individual Dasher earnings trajectory? And then second question on, anything you'd call out in terms of generative AI benefits thus far in the business around efficiency or anything on the new product side? Thanks. \nTony Xu : Sure. Yeah, your first question, Doug, I believe, was on Dasher supply. I mean it's been the healthiest we've seen. And I think this is something that we called out in the letter, where it really is precisely because of the number one feature that we offer in the DoorDash platform has flexibility that there are such high levels of engagement, right?  I mean we have -- as you said, 7 million plus Dashers who earn over $15 billion in the year, these Dashers on average, only Dash about four hours a week, 90% of them Dash fewer than 10 hours a week. So they -- in the vast majority, north of 80%-plus of them have other full-time work. I mean it really is a complementarity to what they already do. So -- I think that's one of the reasons that you're seeing there. So satisfaction is high, engagement is at all-time highs, and it's been easier and easier for us to make sure that we can supply the roads. That doesn't mean that we don't have work to do, by the way. I mean we have a lot of work to do in making sure that the friction to use the app a lot easier. Making sure that we can create more earnings opportunities for Dashers. We launched some new payment models for Dashers for the first time in 2023 in a while. So there's a lot of work to both optimize as well as innovate and create new services for Dashers. On the second question, I think, was on generative AI and the benefits that we've seen. We've been working with a lot of these large language models for probably a couple of years at this point. They certainly do serve some benefits in areas where you see lots of structured information that digests nicely into these LOMs. And which then you can solve. I mean, if you see a lot of work that's been repetitive that it's done manually, for instance, a lot of that can be -- we've seen efficiency gains with generative AI. We're always trying to do our best to play with the newest technologies. But at the same time, I think a lot of times, the question I always ask myself is technology is a tool. We have to make sure we understand the job to be done. And apply their correct tool.  So I think with respect to generative, we have seen efficiencies in many areas. But I think it's something that's going to be explored for many years to come.\nDoug Anmuth : Great. Thank you, Tony. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Erickson : Yeah, thanks. I guess first for Tony, when you think about adding that value to DashPass that you kind of just talked about a minute ago. Do you ever think about maybe partnering with anyone in kind of like an adjacent or even, say, different end market, for example? Or would that added value kind of be more likely homegrown, would you say? And then second, just for Ravi. I guess, a few quarters ago now, you've laid out a really nice chart highlighting kind of how your losses sometimes were going up on new verticals and geos even though your unit economics were also kind of improving at the same time.  So -- as we look at the guidance, are there a lot of end markets or geos where that's still kind of the case? Or I guess, are we reaching a point at some point where those two lines kind of start to go the same direction? Or is that maybe already happening? Just any color there would be great. Thanks. \nTony Xu : Hey, Brad, yeah, on your question on Dash Pass and benefits of whether those benefits can come through partnership or build within. There's -- I mean, a portfolio of bets here, but it really starts within, I think, understanding our own ecosystem. We are fortunate that we have the largest local commerce space of customers in which we can offer these benefits. And I think when you think about the depth of use cases as well as the breadth of use cases. I mean there really isn't any category larger than eating and retail. And so I think job number one is we have to first make sure we do a great job with what we have. And I think if it makes sense to have certain partnerships, we'll certainly consider those. But I think job number one is just realizing how big of an opportunity we have within our own ecosystem and building the best products for our customers.\nRavi Inukonda : I'll take the second one on the overall investment level, right? Like look, I mean, we are not trying to optimize the business for an overall quantum of investment dollars. When you're thinking about operating the business, right? Our goal is to maximize long-term free cash flow per share.  What we're seeing in the business across both new verticals as well as international is volume is growing very nicely. In fact, I mentioned in -- to my earlier question to both Brian and Deepak, like volume is continuing to accelerate in the second half for our new verticals business, international business is continuing to grow. Combined with that, we are seeing improvements in unit economics as we drive efficiency across the P&L. You put both of those together, that strong signal for us both from a product market fit as well as a profitability perspective. Our goal is as long as we are continuing to see that strength as long as we're able to drive growth efficiently. We're going to continue to invest behind that, because that's a driver for long-term free cash flow generation in our business, and both of those I'm very confident are going to contribute to the overall profitability of the entire business for us.\nBrad Erickson : Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nKen Gawrelski : Thank you very much. Two, if I may. First, on the regulatory side, I believe most of the Wolt markets are currently independent contractor model with the exception of Germany. It seems like the EU platform work directive is going to be published any day. And do you expect to have to reclassify Wolt workers in Europe? And then the second one, is based is on the capital return side, based on the '24 EBITDA guidance and the renewed share purchase authorization, I was hoping maybe you could update us on your medium-term thoughts about capital returns? You talked about maximizing free cash flow per share. I know you talked a lot about what you're doing on the numerator. Can you talk a little bit more about the denominator there? Thank you.\nTony Xu : Hey. Ken, I can start. This is Tony. And Ravi, feel free to follow. I think on your first question, which is about regulation in the EU and the platform workers directive. Yeah, I mean, it's certainly an ongoing piece of work that regulators are coming up with. And I think the good news here is that they're doing it in partnership with industry and we expect a very productive outcome for everyone.  I think that, by and large, when I made my comment earlier to the -- I think there was an earlier question about regulation. I mean, there really are just a handful of cities across the world. So not just EU or U.S. or other places in which I think governments don't want to work productively with companies. I think the majority of vast, vast, vast majority scenario we've seen is that governments want to work with companies.  I mean, why wouldn't you? I mean, why wouldn't you want to increase the GDP of the local economy and create more work opportunities, more sales for local businesses and more accessibility for consumers. I think that every government recognizes that, that's a positive sum situation for their constituents. And we see that in the EU. We also see that in most parts of the world. I think your second question was around capital allocation. Maybe I can start and then Ravi, feel free to take the rest. In general, I mean, we're always trying to look to build products for customers. And we think that that's the best way to maximize long-term free cash flow per share. Obviously, to your point, there's two component parts to that. There's the first component in which we're doing our best to grow as fast as possible within a disciplined set of parameters that we set for ourselves. A lot of that isn't just a budget, but also just how we run the business and run different projects against their state of progress, whether they're in search of product market fit, there's a different set of operating metrics that we look at, if they're in a phase of scaling and looking for efficient ways to grow.  There's another set of operating metrics. If they are cash flow generative. There's another set of operating metrics we look at. So I think that's on the former -- on the latter or the denominator, we're always looking to make sure that we do this with discipline. I mean stock-based compensation is certainly is a very real expense. We want to make sure that we're as disciplined as possible with headcount. I'm pleased with the fact that we've been relatively flat on share count over the last six quarters, even though revenue has grown considerably over the same time period. And look, I think it's also been very healthy for company culture. I mean, DoorDash is a company that's quite scrappy in terms of how well we -- how we like to operate and we'd like to continue operating with the same speed and quality.\nRavi Inukonda : Okay, just a couple of points to add, right? Like we've given guidance around both SBC as well as the share count. I mean you can see -- we're focused on driving leverage from a stock-based compensation. I mean it's a true real cost to the business. We've driven leverage last year and expect to continue to drive leverage in that. And from an overall share count perspective, you can see the RSU issuance that we've given, we expect the overall RSUs to come down because it's actually -- SBC is a lagging indicator in some ways.\nKen Gawrelski : Thank you. \nOperator: Our final question today comes from the line of Michael McGovern with the Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael McGovern : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First, I want to ask about the partner commission rate, which you mentioned is down year-over-year. Just curious, as you build out all of these new features for partners, you have under 1% churn for restaurants, as you mentioned. Is that rate going down just a function of signing up a lot of new merchants and kind of what is your expectation long term for your partner commission rate?  And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the advertising business. And when you mentioned in your full year guidance that net revenue margin going up in the second half of the year potentially, does the advertising business contribute significantly to that? So, thank you.\nTony Xu : Sure. Hey, Mike, I'll start and feel free to add in here, Ravi. So on the first question, which I believe is around partner commissions, we're always trying to maximize the value that we bring every single partner, right? And we're fortunate that we've generated lots of sales on behalf of these merchants, and we've spent over $40 billion of R&D, sales and marketing team spend over the past few years in helping achieve that level of sales, which I think would be very difficult impossible for these merchants to replicate on their own. And I think that's why you see that those churn numbers are low and actually, frankly, they continue to get lower.  So for us, it's making sure that we're always delivering more value to these customers such that will continue to grow together. I think there's a long runway ahead before every physical merchant can truly argue and compete on their own as companies in the digital economy. I think we've done a nice job in our first decade of helping the restaurant category get there. But I think we have a lot more work to do certainly within restaurants, and I think we're just getting started outside of restaurants. I think your second question was around ads. Yeah, I mean, the ads business has gone really well. I mean I think that it's not something probably we've talked about that much, but it's certainly grown, I think, commensurate to the size of business that we're at. And for us, again, I think the key operating tenet here is that healthy ads business, we believe, in which it delivers best-in-class industry returns for advertisers as well as -- continues to allow us to have the best consumer experience is one in which we have to have a healthy and growing marketplace. That's what causes or allows the cause for a healthy ads business, not the other way around. And so for us, it's always making sure that we can achieve on those two dimensions where we have the best-in-class returns for advertisers, which we believe we have as well as the smallest or ideally 0 degradation in the consumer experience, which I'm really proud that the team has accomplished. It's done really well.\nRavi Inukonda : Hey, Mike, I'll take your question around the net revenue margin, right? I broaden that just to give you a little bit more context around how I expect the margins to scale through the rest of the year, across both revenue as well as gross margin. I would expect that to increase as we go through the rest of the year. Definitely, to your point, as is contributing to that. In addition to that, I expect us to drive leverage from an overall Dasher cost perspective. We're consistently working on quality.  We're consistently trying to improve the overall efficiency we have on discounts and promos. Again, you should expect us to see drive improvements across the P&L, which will ultimately drive both revenue as well as gross margin, which will also flow through from a contribution and EBITDA margin perspective in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year.\nMichael McGovern : Got it. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ravi Inukonda",
            "content": "Hey, Michael, on the second point on sales and marketing, right? I'll break it into two parts. First, we'll talk about the Q3 to Q4 and then talk about the forward looking, what we expect in 2024. Q3 to Q4, we did generate leverage on consumer acquisition. The change that you're seeing is largely related to Dasher acquisition. That was purely to support the higher growth that we saw in as well as, as you know, there's some seasonal effect from a Dasher acquisition cost in Q4 in order for us to be able to continue to supply to the volumes that we had in Q4. As I look at it, right, when I think about overall leverage from a sales and marketing perspective, two frameworks here. One is we are trying to maximize sort of like payback periods, and our goal is to continue to be within the payback period. You're not looking at the absolute level of dollar investment. We're still within the payback periods on the consumer side. We are still acquiring a healthy level of consumers. Over half of the new consumers in the U.S. today start their journey with DoorDash. So that's going to be a continued way for us to continue to drive growth. On the second one, when I think about overall leverage, it purely starts from product. What you've done -- we've done in the last year or so is we've continued to drive improvements in the product, whether it's on the dasher side or the consumer side that ultimately improves retention. As the retention goes up, you'll start to see benefits from an overall sales and marketing perspective also.  So when I look at 2024, we do expect to generate leverage from an overall sales and marketing. Yeah, Nikhil, I'll take both of those, right? On the first one on the growth point, I mean, just to back up a minute, right, our goal is to grow as fast as we can within the disciplined parameters that we've set for ourselves. I mean, look, we've been public for three years now. We've driven consistently strong growth every single quarter.  What you're seeing in the business is even at our scale, if you look at our overall MAUs, they're growing at a double-digit rate. We've hit $37 million, which is an all-time record for us. Even order frequency continues to grow. When I look at the opportunity either on the users or the order frequency side, the users that are active on the platform are still a small portion of everybody who's used the app at least once in the last year. That just goes to show you the breadth of the opportunity ahead of us. Similarly, on the order frequency side, I mean, the blended order frequency is still very low compared to the number of usable movements we have, especially if you think about all the categories that we are adding in the business. What you're seeing in the business is that we are continuing to drive selection as we're making the product more affordable as the quality continues to increase. You're seeing that strength come through, whether it's retention or order frequency, both are continuing to grow. Our goal is as long as we continue to make the product better, I'm very confident that we're going to be able to drive strong growth across restaurants, new verticals as well as international. And to the second point around EBITDA, again, look, Nikhil, I mean, we've been very pleased with the performance of the business. We've scaled profitability quite nicely if you look at it over the last couple of years. What you saw in '23 is a few things, right? We have generated volume improvements through the course of the year. We have driven unit economic improvements across all major lines of business.  When you put those two together, you saw the second half EBITDA being higher than the first EBITDA, which is very similar to what we saw in the prior year in '22 as well. When I look at '24, I would expect the trend to be very similar, where the second half EBITDA is going to be higher than the first half EBITDA. But more importantly, our philosophy is we're going to operate the business with the same level of rigor and discipline with the goal being trying to drive durable growth and at the same time, improve the profitability of the business. And to the specific factors around first half versus the second half, we are investing in the first half. I mean the investments are, we are seeing strength in restaurants, we're seeing strength in new verticals, we're seeing strengthening on our national business. You can see that in the results, both from a growth as well as a profitability perspective. I do expect those investments to generate leverage in the second half. And secondly, if you have volume continuing to scale, plus the unit economics continuing to improve, you're going to see more of the EBITDA in the second half versus the first half. And even from a margin perspective, I would expect the second half margin to be higher than first half as well as the full year. But just to pull back a minute, right, I'm very pleased with the full year guide for EBITDA because, a, we are driving margin improvement; and b, we are driving overall profitability improvement quite considerably. Hey, Deepak, it's Ravi. I'll extend Tony start on the first question, and then I'll take the second question, right? Like we -- to your point around margins across the investment areas. What we're seeing in the business is really strong performance, not just across growth, but when I look at the unit economics, there's been a material step function change improvement, both on the new vertical side as well as the international side. And to your specific question on the contribution margin, if I look at the basket of our overall international business, there are several countries where the core restaurant business is actually contribution margin positive and still a lot of runway for both growth as well as improvement in the margin structure. And your second point, Deepak, around Q4. Again, I mean the performance was great, right, like nothing specific that we would call out. What you're seeing is volume continuing to grow. In fact, new verticals, the volume actually accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3. Grocery was a bright spot where grocery volume also accelerated in Q4 compared to Q3. International volume continues to be very strong, and we're also seeing unit economic improvement. That's basically what drove the performance both on the top line as well as the bottom line in Q4. Hey, Bernie, it's Ravi. I'll just add to Tony's point around New York City. As you can see from the Q1 EBITDA guide, we are absorbing some of the regulatory costs in Q1. I do expect that to ramp down as we ramp up efficiency as well as we take other actions in the marketplace.  And to your second point around impact on volume, again, it's a small portion of the overall volume in the business. So I would expect the impact on volume to be very minimal. Yeah, Andrew, I'll take the second question around DashMart. I mean look, we're really happy with where the footprint is. We've expanded the footprint a couple of years ago, just to make sure we have the volume density across all the markets that we operate in. Today, our focus continues to be driving same-store sales growth by better merchandising, continue to improve the overall product market fit. We have both retention as well as order frequency.  When you look at the performance of the business, I mean, we're really pleased. It's doing well compared to plan. Our goal is to continue to improve, a, both the volume in that business as well as continuing to drive unit economic improvement where we've seen material improvement compared to last year. As I look at 2024, our priority is going to be continue to keep the existing footprint while increasing volume as well as driving unit economics in that business. Hey, Brian. On the second one, right, in terms of the step function change and improvement in unit economics, I'll start off by saying, like in these businesses that we operate, one of the more important things is scale. Because ultimately, scale as we saw in the restaurant business, that drives volume growth, which ultimately drives efficiency in the business.  If you combine that with the overall platform density that we have, whether it's quality where we're able to accrue benefits across the platform on improvements in credits and refunds or the dasher side efficiency. All of that is driving the improvements you're seeing in the unit economic improvement across both restaurants and honestly, across all parts of the new verticals portfolio. And there's many parts of the P&L that we are driving efficiency across the board. And the second dimension I would give you is when you think about the portfolio and break it apart, right, third-party convenience, we've talked about the fact that, that was unit economic breakeven a few -- several quarters ago. That business has continued to grow as well as improve in overall unit economics. Growth, we are seeing something very similar where the overall unit economics have continued to improve.  Look, I mean, I realize there's a question if these businesses are going to be profitable for us. But when I look at the data, I have no doubt in my mind that all parts of our new vertical business is going to be profitable overtime. But again, it's important to remember, we are still very early in the journey. We're seeing great signals across growth in volume. You saw that in Q4 where the business accelerated as well as growth in unit economics.  So our goal is to continue to invest because that will ultimately drive the free cash flow generation in the business. I'll take the second one on the overall investment level, right? Like look, I mean, we are not trying to optimize the business for an overall quantum of investment dollars. When you're thinking about operating the business, right? Our goal is to maximize long-term free cash flow per share.  What we're seeing in the business across both new verticals as well as international is volume is growing very nicely. In fact, I mentioned in -- to my earlier question to both Brian and Deepak, like volume is continuing to accelerate in the second half for our new verticals business, international business is continuing to grow. Combined with that, we are seeing improvements in unit economics as we drive efficiency across the P&L. You put both of those together, that strong signal for us both from a product market fit as well as a profitability perspective. Our goal is as long as we are continuing to see that strength as long as we're able to drive growth efficiently. We're going to continue to invest behind that, because that's a driver for long-term free cash flow generation in our business, and both of those I'm very confident are going to contribute to the overall profitability of the entire business for us. Okay, just a couple of points to add, right? Like we've given guidance around both SBC as well as the share count. I mean you can see -- we're focused on driving leverage from a stock-based compensation. I mean it's a true real cost to the business. We've driven leverage last year and expect to continue to drive leverage in that. And from an overall share count perspective, you can see the RSU issuance that we've given, we expect the overall RSUs to come down because it's actually -- SBC is a lagging indicator in some ways. Hey, Mike, I'll take your question around the net revenue margin, right? I broaden that just to give you a little bit more context around how I expect the margins to scale through the rest of the year, across both revenue as well as gross margin. I would expect that to increase as we go through the rest of the year. Definitely, to your point, as is contributing to that. In addition to that, I expect us to drive leverage from an overall Dasher cost perspective. We're consistently working on quality.  We're consistently trying to improve the overall efficiency we have on discounts and promos. Again, you should expect us to see drive improvements across the P&L, which will ultimately drive both revenue as well as gross margin, which will also flow through from a contribution and EBITDA margin perspective in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Hey, Michael, it's Tony. Regarding your question on grocery, I think it really depends on what it is that you're trying to build in terms of for the customer. I mean if you think about it, a customer is going to evaluate across several dimensions. They're going to evaluate what grocers they can order from how good the order quality is in terms of if they order ex items, do they get exactly of those ex items, the affordability of the service and obviously, what happens with customer support, especially if things don't go perfectly.  And so we're always judged on those dimensions, and we're always building initiatives towards that. And a lot of this is still really nascent. If you think about DoorDash's entry into the grocery space, which happened about three years ago, we really started by nailing this top-up use case, where we're solving the middle of the week run and delivering the items that are consumed the most often, your berries, your dairy products, your cereals, your coffee, et cetera. All of that was done in concert with fantastic grocers.  We're now shifting a lot of the work towards solving bigger baskets. And so that is just solving for a different use case for the consumer. And I think we're also going to have to do other things, too, because when I just look at the structure of grocery, most of the behavior for consumers still happens off-line where consumers are purchasing groceries inside physical stores. And so that tells me that we still have -- as an industry, a long ways to go to getting a product good enough such that it can replace the offline experience. All of this is going to be done in concert with grocers. And again, it's this kind of continuum of where we want to make sure that we can solve for more than just one dimension. Speed is one of those things, but there's going to be other factors that we have to get right as well. Hey, Deepak, it's Tony. I'll take the first one, which is about investing into international and also into new verticals. So on international, we really are investing across the board with a fairly similar framework, which is really finding product market fit and then finding an efficient way to grow. And in certain markets, it's more about the former. And the majority of markets is more about the latter. But there are markets that are younger in the portfolio.  I mean, I would say, across the board, the penetration levels in terms of our coverage of consumers as well as the merchants that we have remaining to serve is still quite low, certainly lower than where we are in the U.S., but even lower, I would say, to where they can be given the runway that we see. So it's really about making sure that we're efficient and disciplined in investing across whether we are in search of product market fit and improving that or whether we are scaling that quite nicely, in which case you see both an improvement in growth retention as well as unit economics. On the new vertical side, I mean, I think this has been just yet another quarter of continued strength. I mean, the growth on a bigger base has accelerated now three quarters in a row. That's really coming from across the board, investments into grocery, the convenience category, DashMarts, retail. So really, we're seeing improvements in growth, retention, unit economics across all major lines within our investment areas.  There's lots of work -- so I don't -- that would probably take much more than the hour to discuss with respect to products that we're working on. But all of them are trying to better the selection that we offer, the quality of the service, the affordability of the service and the customer support levels. Sure. Bernie, it's Tony. I'll start and feel free to chime in, Ravi. First question is on regulation. I mean, by enlarge, the way we see the landscape is fairly similar to how we've seen it every year in the 10 years that we've been building DoorDash, which is most governments that we work with want to actually work with us and want to work with business. And they understand that in order for something like DoorDash to work, it has to work for all audiences. We're always trying to keep the most affordable prices for consumers. We want to maximize the sales for local businesses, and we want to offer the most number of work opportunities for Dashers.  The vast, vast, vast majority of places that we operate in work this way. I think there are a handful of markets, one of which you called out, New York City, that kind of takes policies to the extreme. And I think has had some adverse impacts against its wishes, which is whenever you see regulation enter the way it does in a place like New York City, what you see is cost rise for the overall system. So there are -- there's less accessibility to consumers, to your point about rising costs. There are lower sales for local businesses, and there are fewer work opportunities for Dashers.  And we largely expect that the vast, vast majority of cities will be fairly central in terms of how they think about working together with companies like ourselves. But there are a handful of markets in which have taken extreme policies. We don't expect that to change much in terms of the financial impact, all of that is reflected in our guidance. I think your second question was around DashPass. I mean, DashPass had a great year. I mean it was a record year in terms of its membership as well as the order frequency that we saw with DashPass subscribers. This includes Wolt+ as well. In fact, internationally, we actually saw the members for DashPass and Wolt+ double in the quarter. And so we're certainly seeing quite a lot of strength there. I mean the way I think about it is, I mean, there's 100 possible use cases per month for every consumer in terms of the categories and their consumption, whether that's eating or buying in retail.  Even for our best customers and certainly for the average subscriber, we're just a fraction of those use cases. So when I think about the runway, I think it's quite far. And if we can certainly serve every use case for local commerce, I think the subscriber base would be fairly healthy. Hey, Andrew, I mean, I think you pretty much answered the question yourself, which is -- I mean we're investing in all the dimensions in which a consumer judges us, right? So we're adding selection to the platform. We've launched a lot of awesome retailers over 2023. Even this year, we launched with Ahold most recently here in the U.S. We're certainly helping to improve the affordability of the service, and there's lots of work to do there. We are working on improving the quality of the service. I mean I think the hardest challenge that every grocer faces, whether it's physically or digitally in terms of sales is knowing how much inventory they have on the shelves.  And that is one of the biggest reasons in terms of why sometimes consumers prefer to go and shop inside stores. And customer support is always something that we're trying to get better. And when I look internationally, I mean, it's similar, but it's across more categories. It's not just new verticals or retail, it's also across the restaurant sector. We're just a lot earlier there in terms of the penetration levels. We have a lot more places we have to launch. We have a lot more restaurants and retailers we have to sign up. We have a lot more work to do in terms of launching our subscription programs in the countries. I mean they've seen great adoption so far, but we're very early in terms of the launch.  And then we always have to make sure that we can make the product better. Hey, Brian, with respect to all of the barriers to adoption, I think there are a few, but I would start by saying that things in general are going pretty well. I mean we have over 20% of customers ordering in the non-restaurants category for the first time. I mean we're now north of 100,000 plus stores that are outside of restaurants that are on our platform, which we estimate to be the largest in North America. More and more grocers, retailers are coming inbound, and then similarly, more and more consumers are shopping for the first time in the grocery category on DoorDash even ahead of restaurants. So I think there's a lot of goodness to see. And if you think about what that's centered on, that's really been centered on the fact that we launched with this top of use case, which we effectively had to invent, if you think about it. People knew DoorDash really as a place to get lunch and dinner very quickly. And so we launched this product where you can get your middle of the week run done as fast as possible.  When you run out of eggs or cereal or your berries that usually isn't like the most fulfilling trip to go inside a physical store yourself. But it's also something you want to be done quickly. And so that's something that we've solved pretty well. At the same time, I think there are a lot of barriers. I mean, if you just pan out and look at the industry, I mean, digital sales or e-commerce penetration of grocery is still amongst the lowest, if not the lowest across all categories of e-commerce.  And I think there's many reasons. First is how do you make sure that you can get exactly what a customer wants delivered to their home. I mean if you look at one of the challenges that grocers have, whether it's through their physical stores or their online channels, it's not knowing how much inventory that they actually carry. There's other barriers around affordability. I think customers largely expect to pay similar to what they pay inside the store when they get something delivered. And when you look at selection, that's something that we're just working towards. I mean it's happening actually pretty rapidly and consistently where three years ago, when we just launched our service. We were working with maybe a couple of dozen of retailers now that's in the hundreds with hundreds of thousands of stores. So that remains a thing. And I think the final thing is that it's just going to take a bit of time. I mean, I think most people in the country or in the world know DoorDash and Wolt has a place to get lunch or dinner delivered. I think it takes some time to get everyone to know that you can get your city delivered. We've certainly made a priority bet on grocery. I think it's paid off really well. I mean we see it every day in the numbers in terms of growth, retention as well as improvements in unit economics. But look, it's a long ways to go. I mean, we're three years into it where we went from zero to multibillion, which we're excited about, but I think it's just the beginning. Hey, James, yeah, I mean I would say that getting supply of grocers onto the platform has not been an issue for us. I mean, it's actually gone really well and really quickly. I mean if you asked me three years ago, do -- would we have thought that we would be north of 100,000 stores in North America from close to zero? I'm not sure. And if you ask me whether or not that we would have over 20% of customers ordering outside of restaurants. I'm not sure. And I think if you asked me, would these things continue to grow as quickly as they have. I'm also not sure.  And I think one of the reasons why it's been fairly straightforward in terms of onboarding these grocers is that they see in DoorDash, the largest local commerce base of users that are shopping with the greatest frequency, which means it's very highly incremental. I mean they've seen that with each grocer that we work with we conduct incrementality tests that continue to show that DoorDash is just adding more and more sales for them and also, frankly, solving new use cases that they had previously saw.  And I think they also see in DoorDash, a partner that they can build with decades or centuries into the future. Yeah, it's gone really well. I mean, I think the results kind of speak for themselves. I mean, we now acquire more customers than any other platform who shop in the convenience or grocery or alcohol segments than anyone else. I think we cited in Q3 that our grocery business is growing triple digits, which I think when you compare to peers suggest that we're outpacing by many multiples. So I think the numbers kind of speak for themselves. Hey, Mark, it's Tony. Well, I mean, I think there's a few things here with respect to membership adoption. I think the first is just making sure that members are aware of the savings that they're actually receiving. I think if you think about DoorDash, we have within our own ecosystem, hundreds of millions of customers who've ordered with us. But as you saw, we wrote in our shareholder letter that we have 37 million monthly active customers. And so there's a pretty large base who I think we have to meet them where they are in terms of their usage behavior and then make them aware of the possible savings that there could be. So I think thing number one -- job number one is really making sure that we can make all customers within the DoorDash and bulk ecosystem to understand the savings that they would be receiving. I think job number two is always increasing the value that members receive. And so that's something that we're always working towards and we'll add more and more benefits overtime. Sure. Yeah, your first question, Doug, I believe, was on Dasher supply. I mean it's been the healthiest we've seen. And I think this is something that we called out in the letter, where it really is precisely because of the number one feature that we offer in the DoorDash platform has flexibility that there are such high levels of engagement, right?  I mean we have -- as you said, 7 million plus Dashers who earn over $15 billion in the year, these Dashers on average, only Dash about four hours a week, 90% of them Dash fewer than 10 hours a week. So they -- in the vast majority, north of 80%-plus of them have other full-time work. I mean it really is a complementarity to what they already do. So -- I think that's one of the reasons that you're seeing there. So satisfaction is high, engagement is at all-time highs, and it's been easier and easier for us to make sure that we can supply the roads. That doesn't mean that we don't have work to do, by the way. I mean we have a lot of work to do in making sure that the friction to use the app a lot easier. Making sure that we can create more earnings opportunities for Dashers. We launched some new payment models for Dashers for the first time in 2023 in a while. So there's a lot of work to both optimize as well as innovate and create new services for Dashers. On the second question, I think, was on generative AI and the benefits that we've seen. We've been working with a lot of these large language models for probably a couple of years at this point. They certainly do serve some benefits in areas where you see lots of structured information that digests nicely into these LOMs. And which then you can solve. I mean, if you see a lot of work that's been repetitive that it's done manually, for instance, a lot of that can be -- we've seen efficiency gains with generative AI. We're always trying to do our best to play with the newest technologies. But at the same time, I think a lot of times, the question I always ask myself is technology is a tool. We have to make sure we understand the job to be done. And apply their correct tool.  So I think with respect to generative, we have seen efficiencies in many areas. But I think it's something that's going to be explored for many years to come. Hey, Brad, yeah, on your question on Dash Pass and benefits of whether those benefits can come through partnership or build within. There's -- I mean, a portfolio of bets here, but it really starts within, I think, understanding our own ecosystem. We are fortunate that we have the largest local commerce space of customers in which we can offer these benefits. And I think when you think about the depth of use cases as well as the breadth of use cases. I mean there really isn't any category larger than eating and retail. And so I think job number one is we have to first make sure we do a great job with what we have. And I think if it makes sense to have certain partnerships, we'll certainly consider those. But I think job number one is just realizing how big of an opportunity we have within our own ecosystem and building the best products for our customers. Hey. Ken, I can start. This is Tony. And Ravi, feel free to follow. I think on your first question, which is about regulation in the EU and the platform workers directive. Yeah, I mean, it's certainly an ongoing piece of work that regulators are coming up with. And I think the good news here is that they're doing it in partnership with industry and we expect a very productive outcome for everyone.  I think that, by and large, when I made my comment earlier to the -- I think there was an earlier question about regulation. I mean, there really are just a handful of cities across the world. So not just EU or U.S. or other places in which I think governments don't want to work productively with companies. I think the majority of vast, vast, vast majority scenario we've seen is that governments want to work with companies.  I mean, why wouldn't you? I mean, why wouldn't you want to increase the GDP of the local economy and create more work opportunities, more sales for local businesses and more accessibility for consumers. I think that every government recognizes that, that's a positive sum situation for their constituents. And we see that in the EU. We also see that in most parts of the world. I think your second question was around capital allocation. Maybe I can start and then Ravi, feel free to take the rest. In general, I mean, we're always trying to look to build products for customers. And we think that that's the best way to maximize long-term free cash flow per share. Obviously, to your point, there's two component parts to that. There's the first component in which we're doing our best to grow as fast as possible within a disciplined set of parameters that we set for ourselves. A lot of that isn't just a budget, but also just how we run the business and run different projects against their state of progress, whether they're in search of product market fit, there's a different set of operating metrics that we look at, if they're in a phase of scaling and looking for efficient ways to grow.  There's another set of operating metrics. If they are cash flow generative. There's another set of operating metrics we look at. So I think that's on the former -- on the latter or the denominator, we're always looking to make sure that we do this with discipline. I mean stock-based compensation is certainly is a very real expense. We want to make sure that we're as disciplined as possible with headcount. I'm pleased with the fact that we've been relatively flat on share count over the last six quarters, even though revenue has grown considerably over the same time period. And look, I think it's also been very healthy for company culture. I mean, DoorDash is a company that's quite scrappy in terms of how well we -- how we like to operate and we'd like to continue operating with the same speed and quality. Sure. Hey, Mike, I'll start and feel free to add in here, Ravi. So on the first question, which I believe is around partner commissions, we're always trying to maximize the value that we bring every single partner, right? And we're fortunate that we've generated lots of sales on behalf of these merchants, and we've spent over $40 billion of R&D, sales and marketing team spend over the past few years in helping achieve that level of sales, which I think would be very difficult impossible for these merchants to replicate on their own. And I think that's why you see that those churn numbers are low and actually, frankly, they continue to get lower.  So for us, it's making sure that we're always delivering more value to these customers such that will continue to grow together. I think there's a long runway ahead before every physical merchant can truly argue and compete on their own as companies in the digital economy. I think we've done a nice job in our first decade of helping the restaurant category get there. But I think we have a lot more work to do certainly within restaurants, and I think we're just getting started outside of restaurants. I think your second question was around ads. Yeah, I mean, the ads business has gone really well. I mean I think that it's not something probably we've talked about that much, but it's certainly grown, I think, commensurate to the size of business that we're at. And for us, again, I think the key operating tenet here is that healthy ads business, we believe, in which it delivers best-in-class industry returns for advertisers as well as -- continues to allow us to have the best consumer experience is one in which we have to have a healthy and growing marketplace. That's what causes or allows the cause for a healthy ads business, not the other way around. And so for us, it's always making sure that we can achieve on those two dimensions where we have the best-in-class returns for advertisers, which we believe we have as well as the smallest or ideally 0 degradation in the consumer experience, which I'm really proud that the team has accomplished. It's done really well."

Andy, over to you.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our Q3 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Ravi Inukonda. We will be making forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call being our expectations for our business, financial position, operating performance, our guidance, strategies, our investment approach, and the consumer spending environment. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. Many of these uncertainties and risks are described in our SEC filings, including Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our earnings release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call is being audio webcasted on our Investor Relations website. And an audio replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. Operator, I will pass it back to you and we will begin taking questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nNikhil Devnani: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I had a two-parter on the U.S marketplace. So everyone is obviously worried about a variety of headwinds and a softening consumer, yet your business is accelerating in the U.S. Can you comment on, one, what drove that acceleration? And then as a follow-on, I think the perception is your marketplace is highly discretionary, but given all the data you see in how consumers actually use your service, would you agree with that assessment? And how do you think about the sensitivity of demand?\nTony Xu: Hi, Nikhil, it's Tony. Maybe I'll start and Ravi, feel free to chime in. On the first part of the question, I mean you're absolutely right. I think we saw a phenomenal quarter where frankly, every line of business has accelerated in growth and improved in its unit economics. And that's impressive, especially given the fact that we're a lot larger today than we were a quarter ago and certainly a year ago. In terms of the U.S. restaurant business or the marketplace in general, I mean, a few phenomenon are going on, but really it's the result of product improvements we've made. Whether you look a quarter ago or a year ago, we've added selection to the platform on the restaurant side, and we've added a lot of selection on the non-restaurants front, literally going from 0 nearly 3 years ago to a multibillion-dollar business that's at scale now growing fast and contributing quite significantly. And we have over 100,000 stores on the platform that are outside of restaurants. And when you look outside of restaurants and into the convenience or grocery or alcohol segments, almost half of new customers that come into the industry in the U.S. come to DoorDash first. And so that's certainly adding in terms of the selection. Second, we've continued to improve the quality of service, whether it's our timeliness, our speed, our accuracy. Third, we've improved the affordability of the programs, both for our non-DashPass members as well as for our DashPass cohorts. And fourth, we've improved customer support all along the way. And so it's really the result of many years of work on the fundamentals and mastery of that and continuing to see opportunities to continue improving the product, both in terms of efficiencies and just product quality to the customer that's leading to the growth of all of the lines of business in the U.S., and that's what you kind of saw culminate in some of the numbers that we reported in Q3. I think with respect to the second question, it's -- I think we've -- our business has always been very dynamic in terms of all of the headwinds and tailwinds it's faced in the 10 years that we've been building DoorDash. And that's certainly been true in the last 3 years. Obviously, we lived through a global pandemic. We lived through peak pandemic. We have lived through peak inflation. We've lived through lots of other macro factors, including some of the ones impacting us today. And I think it's important to remind ourselves of a few things. While it's virtually impossible to estimate or isolate the quantum impact of any one of these macro factors, I think it's a lot easier to think about things that we do control. And as mentioned in the answer to the previous question, we've continued to improve our product. And that's certainly within our control and as dynamic, if not more dynamic, than some of the macro changes that we face. I think, second, we benefit from the fact that our first category, the restaurants category, stems in the sense that while sure, maybe not every meal has to be eaten when it comes to delivery or takeout, but when you think about every category that lends itself towards convenience, and we all know that convenience only lends itself towards the direction of greater convenience. Food is the most resilient and highest frequency category. I mean, this is true in every line of eCommerce. In fact, if you look at our cohort performance, which we talked a little bit about in our shareholder letter this quarter, you see that virtually every single cohort, including those that just joined our platform a couple of months ago are doing way better than any of the cohorts even during the pandemic. And so I think as you see that behavior across every line of -- every segment of customers every cohort across time, I think you start to gain a different picture of just the fact of the product improvements as well as the number of shots on goal that we get to take relative to others in capturing that customer. And the final comment I'd make is, in spite of our performance and our market leadership, we are still a tiny fraction of what's addressable. I mean in the U.S. restaurants category, as 1 example, we are less than double-digit percentage sales of the industry. I think you looked globally within restaurants, we are a much tinier single-digit percentage. And if we included all the other categories that we now entered, we are barely noticeable. And so I think we have a long runway left. We have a lot more work to do to get our product to where we would like it to be. But I think the product improvements that we've made in the years leading up to these moments have certainly helped us build a product that endures.\nNikhil Devnani: Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. If I can ask three quick ones, that would be great. First, Tony, on the international footprint. We are now into -- well past the year into the Wolt integration. How do you feel about that? And are there any geographies that you think might be interesting from an M&A perspective in the future for international? Second question is we keep getting this one a lot from the investment community. Maybe you guys can clearly the air on the GLP-1 diet drugs. Is there any way to think about how that might impact your business in the future? It's obviously not impacting it now. And then lastly, Instacart is now, there is a public company. Just curious to get any milestones on grocery GOV as we sit here at the end of '23 from you guys? Thanks a lot.\nTony Xu: Great. Hey, Ross. I'll do my best to take them the first two in order and maybe I'll let Ravi take the third one. So I think the first question was around international. I mean you're absolutely right. We are very excited about our execution on the international front. We continue to grow at multiples of what we see around the world, virtually across any geography. That doesn't mean that we are pleased yet with where our product is. We still have a lot of room left to go. But I think it does stem from why our outperformance has occurred, which is I think the hallmarks at any great marketplace have the fundamental characteristics of great retention order frequency and unit economics. And I think when you look at our international business or our new categories business or a restaurant business, you see all of these characteristics present. And that's why we've been very interested in leaning in and making the investments that we have at size, at scale, because of what we see. And the international business continues to see those points of execution. I think if we remind ourselves even a couple of years ago of the investment thesis behind our partnership with Wolt, it really centered on two big pieces. One of which was here is a business that has leading world-class retention and order frequency, and the question is, can we invest behind that in a concentrated way and hopefully add to the excellent execution that they've already seen. And so far, the answer has been yes to that. In fact, Miki and the team now runs our entire portfolio, certainly the Wolt portfolio as well as the DoorDash portfolio outside of the United States. And the second part of the thesis was that there is a long runway for growth in a lot of these countries, and we continue to see that, too. In the 27 countries outside of the U.S. that we operate in, we are in some ways behind where the U.S. is from a penetration perspective and also product adoption perspective. There just is a lot more population we have to address. There are more merchant partners we've yet to partner with. There's a lot more customer problems given the fact that some of these places are a little bit behind from a technology footprint. And so there's a lot of work to do, but it also means that there's a lot of runway ahead. And I think that's why you've seen continued momentum, and it's adding now to the overall growth of the company. I think your second question was around some of the recent discussions externally around a certain class of drugs. First and foremost, I hope that they actually work these drugs. As a former scientist, I'm a big believer, whenever a great science can actually meet the challenges of its time and I do think that they're solving a worthy problem. So first and foremost, for the patients, I hope that they work for the long-term. Second, we don't see any immediate or noticeable impacts in the business relative to, I guess, what the commentary may be out there about this class of drugs. And I think this kind of goes a little bit to the first question that was asked, which is it's been really hard to size any one macroeconomic factor, whether it's a headwind, a tailwind, a side wind. I think instead, what we focused on is just continued improvement on our product velocity, product quality and execution. And I think that the dynamic changes we make in our product can outweigh many of the macro factors that may be at play.\nRavi Inukonda: Ross, on your third question around grocery. I mean, look, we are really pleased with the performance of the grocery business. Our focus over the last couple of years has been how do we increase the usage? How do we increase the adoption of not just our grocery business, but really, in fact, the entire new verticals, all of the categories that we operate in? What we are seeing in the business today is a couple of things, right? One is more number of users are ordering from both restaurants as well as new verticals. And that's driving two things. We are seeing the new verticals business overall accelerate from the prior quarter. As well as when you look at the grocery business itself on the GOV to the specific question you asked, our GOV has doubled year-on-year. If you look at that paired with the efficiency that we've seen in the business, we've driven a ton of efficiency across the business. In fact, when I look at the unit economics, there's been a dramatic improvement in unit economics. You have to realize we have a strategic advantage because we have a network of consumers. We have a network of Dashers already built out, and that's allowing us to improve unit economics at a much faster pace. For us, the way we operate the business is we look at signals around retention. We look at signals around order frequency. We look at signals around unit economics. We continue to be very pleased with the improvement across all three. Our goal is to continue to invest behind improving selection, improving the product quality because our strong belief is that this is going to be a strong long-term ROI generating business for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a couple of ones. So first, I wanted to ask about the product initiatives for 2024. You entered into a lot of categories and new markets in 2022. And 2023 was more of a year of execution and sort of like a refinement that helped profitability, obviously, as an incremental driver. What are the big business opportunities for '24? Or should we view it as another year of execution and refinement of existing businesses? That's the first question. And then second one, the acceleration in the order frequency at this scale in the core restaurant business is pretty impressive. Are you seeing some of the maybe less common use cases, I don't know, maybe breakfast orders or corporate orders or anything that's helping incrementally in the recent quarters? Can you help unpack the trends in use cases a little bit?\nTony Xu: Sure. Deepak, maybe I can start and take the questions and then Ravi, feel free to chime in. The first question, which stems on '24 and some of the initiatives that we are thinking about. First, our goal is to grow and to empower local economies. So we are always looking for problems to solve and jobs to be done. And obviously, we want to make sure that we have a strong point of view where we can do it at least 10x better than, however, the problem is currently being solved. And so when we looked at, if we rewound the clock for instance to 2019, we were thinking quite a lot about what other problems we could solve. And many of the problems that we actually heard came from our customers directly. I'll give a few examples. When I came to consumers, a lot of the challenges that we had heard were really making sure that we can help solve their other problems. Again, because we started in the restaurants category, which has the highest frequency of activity and the fact that we would show up to many consumers' doors many times a week, I think consumers started asking the question, well, what else can you do for me? And similarly for merchants, I think there were many questions that they wanted our help with, this is even well before the pandemic of how can they become an omni-channel business. And that's why we certainly made further investments into products like DoorDash Drive, but also started the creation of DoorDash Storefront, which has continued to serve various merchant cohorts and segments. And we continue to build further services as we think about how can we help a merchant build their first-party channel as much as we help build their third-party channel of DoorDash. And as I kind of keep thinking along the years, I mean, advertising came in that way as well. Many merchants as well as advertisers that are new to our ecosystem kind of approached us and said, hey, it looks like you have a high frequency setup with the largest number of local commerce business where you can measure everything very, very closely and directly. Is there a way in which you can be more useful, I think, to all of the audiences? And that's kind of how we thought about all of the different problems. When I think about '24 or '25 or '26, that's generally how we think about things, too, where we start with certainly our core set of businesses, which today is five businesses, where in 2019, it was closer to one business. And so it's a little bit more varied now and complicated in terms of thinking about all the different opportunities because we believe each one of these five businesses are still actually in their earliest innings, even the U.S. restaurants business. But we are also looking at opportunities to always solve more problems. And I hope that as we listen to our audiences more deeply and can get and operate at a lower level of detail, we will actually be able to pick up new problems to solve. Now we always do this in a fairly disciplined way. Again, I think at DoorDash, we really believe in investing appropriately towards the stage of the project. And so usually, when we are solving these problems and we have many of these experiments going on, we tend to take fairly small bets. And it's only until we believe that we've nailed product market fit as well as finding an efficient way to grow, do we actually concentrate behind that bet and go all in for it. And so that's how we are thinking about '24 in that way, too. I think your second question was around the continued growth in engagement and frequency of our customer base in restaurants even at our current scale. Well, I think there's a lot of things that drive this. I think sometimes when we think about businesses like our oldest business, the U.S. restaurants business, we tend to think that perhaps it's closer to the ninth inning of progress versus the third inning of progress. And I tend to think, at least when I talk to our customers, that we are way closer towards the third inning than the ninth inning. And we just have a lot more work to do in terms of making improvements to the product. There isn't one single thing that we're doing that's yielding, I think, some of the improvements that you're seeing in the results. But really, it's years of working on the selection, the quality of service, the affordability of the program, the added value to our DashPass members as well as improved customer support, that's producing some of the results today. It will be really hard candidly to look backwards and say, \"hey, in which year did the product work actually lead to the results that led to this quarter's efforts\". But I think instead, what we do is, we are always trying to make continued improvement. And I think whenever we've taken that focus, we've surprised ourselves to the upside of how much more there is to go as well as the compounding effects that can happen over time.\nRavi Inukonda: Yes, Deepak, maybe just to add a couple of thoughts to what Tony talked about. Look, I mean we've had a phenomenal year so far, what we are seeing both on the top line as well as the bottom line. Part of that is, in fact, being driven by all the investments we made, whether it's on the product side or investments in new verticals as well as the investments we've made in international over the last couple of years. What we are seeing is we are seeing really strong growth across all lines of business that we operate in. These categories that we operate in are large. There's really lots of customer problems, as Tony talked about, that we need to continue to work on and improve. Our goal and philosophy is we will continue to invest as long as we see good signal on both volume as well as unit economics, because this is the blueprint for us to drive really strong free cash flow in the many years to come in our business.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Tony, I wanted to ask a little bit more about just take rates on a year-over-year basis. They continue to expand and roll down a little bit sequentially. Just talk just a little bit more on the progress you're making to keep and/or drive take rates higher. So progress around wait times, incentive spend, how you see advertising fit in there? Any insights on where take rates might go? And then we are now a quarter into Dash's new app and layout and heard some of the comments around grocery prior, but any change in behavior that you've seen from the new app now that we are a quarter in? Thank you.\nRavi Inukonda: Let me take the first one on take rate and then I'll let Tony chime in on the second one. Look, I mean, we are not managing the business to a specific margin target, let alone a margin across any line of the P&L. What you're seeing on the take rate side is, if you actually look at the underlying drivers of the business across the various lines of business, the net revenue margin has actually increased sequentially as well as year-on-year. What you're seeing on the output is really the mix shift of various lines of business. If you recall the comments that we made earlier, new verticals, our international business is actually growing faster than our restaurant business. And you're really seeing the mix shift of those two businesses, which are still early in terms of their journey starting to take impact from an overall take rate perspective. That said, our goal is always how do we find efficiencies across every line of the P&L and using that efficiency to continue to reinvest back in the business to drive growth. And we did that exactly the same in this quarter, right. We found a lot of efficiencies as was a good contributor to the revenue upside that you're seeing in the business, we use that to continue to drive efficient growth, which gave a result of some of the accelerated growth that you're seeing in the business.\nTony Xu: And in terms of your second question about consumer behavior, given some of the app changes that we announced earlier this summer. I mean we continue to see, I guess, more confirmatory evidence that consumers really like the changes. And I think it's usually pretty rare to see this because whenever you make a pretty sizable change like the one that we made to our consumer app, you tend to get a, who moved my cheese reaction. And I think instead, we actually saw behavior that suggested the opposite where customers were naturally shopping across different categories. And I think one of the drivers of this was that we actually made sure that our progress within each vertical was fairly robust in terms of the level of product market fit that we wanted to achieve before we actually redesigned the entire app experience such that we weren't reorienting consumers to something that we were pushing upon them, but rather it was meeting them where they want it to be given that they were pulling us in terms of the demand that they naturally suggested and showed across each line of business. So we are seeing, as I mentioned before, customers continuing to cross-shop across different categories quite naturally and those numbers continue to increase. We are seeing many -- for many consumers, the first interaction with DoorDash actually tends to be sometimes outside of the restaurant category. And I think these are some of the factors that have contributed to the fact that when you look outside of restaurants and you look at the convenience, grocery, alcohol segments, customers that are adopting eCommerce in these categories for the first time, about half of them are coming to DoorDash first.\nRon Josey: Thank you, Tony.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just one on a broader topic. We've seen a ruling in New York City on compensation and investors continue to ask a lot about how the Department of Labor might play out. Any updated thoughts on the regulatory environment overall? And how are you thinking about aligning investments against that potential for nuance in the regulatory environment in the quarters ahead? Thanks so much.\nTony Xu: Yes. Hey, Eric, it's Tony. I'll start and feel free, Ravi, to chime in. I think in general, we have the same point of view on the regulatory landscape today as we had shockingly even 10 years ago, which is that, by and large, governments, lawmakers, regulators, they actually want to work productively with companies like ourselves to really co-create, I think, what the future of work and future of labor will be. And if you think about it, the reason why tens of millions of Dashers have come to the DoorDash platform over time or millions come to our platform every single month or the fact that the DoorDash Dasher app is actually one of the most downloaded consumer apps on the Apple iTunes store is because they simply don't earn enough income from the full time jobs that they do have. 90% of our Dashers Dash fewer than 10 hours a week. The average Dasher does 3 to 4 hours a week, over 80% plus of them have full time jobs. And so they're really seeing DoorDash as a bridge between what income they earn today and the income that they hope to earn to meet the cost of living. And so -- and I think that most regulators actually understand this point, but we -- our hypothesis 10 years ago and kind of our views updating to this day has always been that there might be a handful of jurisdictions, who probably don't want to work productively with businesses and support this new paradigm and instead, candidly create policy that's just bad policy that will achieve unintended consequences that go counter to their goals. And when we think the New York City legislation or proposed legislation is one of those bodies, we see similar activities in Seattle. But when you, again, count up all of the regulatory discussions, I think it still favors kind of our original hypothesis, which is outside of a handful of jurisdictions. Most governments, lawmakers and regulators want to work productively with companies like DoorDash to do the right thing for Dashers.\nRavi Inukonda: Eric, just to add to what Tony said, really on the New York City, one, we've gotten a couple of questions about this as well. That is not live yet. We do expect 2 year back from the judge at any point, just like everybody else. Our goal and philosophy and how do we respond to some of these changes has always been the first and foremost priority is to drive efficiency in every market that we operate in because our goal is to ensure we have sustainable unit economics. To the extent we are not able to meet our goals around unit economics, we do realize there's going to be increased cost in the system. Like Tony talked about, we don't think it's great because that just reduces the transaction activity across the ecosystem, which means lower sales for merchants as well as internal lower earnings for Dashers. And from the financial impact perspective itself, any impact from New York City ruling in Q4, we've included that in our EBITDA guidance that we've given. Our goal is to manage the business to be within that range that we've talked about.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Recognize that product improvement factors are outweighing macro, but we've heard a number of companies call out some early 4Q volatility from either macro or geopolitical. Just curious if you can get anything has changed there at all into 4Q? And then, Ravi, can you talk a little bit more about your improvements to GAAP profitability and just how we should think about that path in upcoming quarters? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Sure. I can start on the first question, and Ravi, feel free to chime in and also take the second question. With respect to the macro dynamics, again, I think it's just really, really hard to size any one of these things. And I think when you sum it all up and as you mentioned, there's lots of things going on in the world today, with the economy, with other events across the globe. And there's certainly puts and takes, I think, to each one of these things. And I think that when -- it's not just the fact that we have product improvements that I think that has helped out way and helped execute very efficiently and continue to grow at higher rates even at our increased scale. It's also the fact that, when you look at every category of spend, food is one that everyone has to spend in. Sure, one may argue that you don't have to spend it on delivery, but what we tend to see is that there's also the macro trend of convenience increasing in the direction of greater convenience. And so if someone has some dollars to spend, it tends to start with the category of the highest frequency where they also seek convenience. And there's just more opportunities to do that given that someone consumes food 20 to 25 times a week. So we are not seeing any of the activity perhaps that I think some other categories in commerce are seeing, but I think it's really multifaceted. There's the product improvements there's the fact that people have to spend on food, and it tends to, therefore, lend itself towards the category where for eCommerce, it's the most resilient and the highest frequency. I mean, you can say this for the past 60 years, which obviously has a lot of macro dynamics as well. And you see that in only 2 out of the 60 years, I think, did the restaurant industry in the U.S., at least ever decline. And so I think it gives you a sense of the robustness of this category. And then I think the final point is we are still a lot earlier than people think in the category than perhaps our scale suggests. And that means that we are not where we need to be at in terms of where our selection of merchants are, whether it's restaurants or new categories, the affordability of the program, the quality of the service and our customer support. We have to make improvements in all areas.\nRavi Inukonda: Doug, just a few more points to what Tony touched on, and then I'll talk about the second question that you asked. We obviously have a lot of signal in the business. I mean we watch this very closely. When I look at the underlying cohorts, I mean they're really strong. If you look at the performance of not just Q3, but actually the first 9 months of the year, cohorts continue to improve, and I look at retention, it's very stable. Our users, in fact, at our scale are growing double digits. Order frequency, like we talked about earlier, continues to grow. So we are very pleased with the performance of the business and a lot of strength that we are seeing in the business. To your second point around GAAP profitability itself, as we've mentioned before, GAAP net income in and of itself is not an explicit target that we are managing the business towards. Financial has always been how do we maximize the long-term free cash flow in the business. And what you're truly seeing in the business today is every single line of business is becoming more efficient. We've dramatically improved the unit economics across the restaurant business, new verticals as well as our international business. I do expect every business to be profitable over time. And as and when that happens, the overall business is going to get to be GAAP net income positive as well. But that's not an explicit target that we are driving the business towards.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Tony, I wanted to go back to one of the comments you made earlier where you talked about investing appropriately towards the stage of the product. So can we talk a little bit about grocery through that lens? So give us some examples of areas of investment that you made this year based on the state of the product that maybe you -- I would say, okay, 1 year later, we can do more of this in '24. I'm just trying to get an understanding for what are the areas you've pressed on hardest in investment in grocery? And what are the areas where you think that there could be more investment to come to really drive that business faster for longer in '24 and beyond? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Sure. I mean -- okay, we can take many flavors of this question because, I mean, this is probably something that I spend the majority of my time on, which is initiative and product reviews, because I do think it's really hard to apply the correct judgment certainly correctly every time, depending on the phase of the project. And -- but take a few instances, right? For instance, we really didn't -- one of the first choices we made on grocery was, well, what's the right product to build. And I think there were many external beliefs of perhaps what you have to build in order to create a sustainable grocery business. But we took the view of what is the actual problems left to be solved, first and foremost, coming from our customers. And one of the things that we heard, for example, was that while what's really frustrating about grocery delivery is that the items that either perish the fastest or that we consume as consumers the most frequently. So think about your berries or your milk or your eggs or your cereals or your coffees. It's really annoying in the middle of the week to have to go back into the store and somehow go and get it. Whereas for other types of shopping behavior, if I'm already out on the weekends anyway, and I'm buying other things for the week, maybe it's less of a big deal. And so the first product we've built was actually to solve a smaller basket topic use case, which really introduced ourselves to consumers and helping address a problem we heard. And then I think had the byproduct of introducing ourselves to grocers, too, because this was a use case that they hadn't been investing that much into. And then I think it surprised everyone how large that opportunity occurred. So that's like one version of this, which is before we kind of just look at what everyone else is doing, that's first and foremost, start by building the correct product. And I think building the correct product has a lot of implications on do we use engineers and business people and other functions correctly and therefore, get the most out of the team's potential. I think there's a version of that shows up. I think number two, another example would be, while we didn't really spend much on marketing when it came to building the grocery business. Now Ravi echoed some of the kind of reasons why because, well, one, we do have the largest audience of local commerce customers coming to our app shopping as well as just coming to the app and including those that don't shop. And so we had a bit of a benefit there. But at the same instance, we also didn't want to invest in marketing because the product wasn't good enough yet. And so I think those are two, I guess, examples I would call out where you have to make the right call on how to make the most efficient use of your resources. And first and foremost, for us, it starts with solving the right customer problem correctly. And whenever we see something that's not being solved correctly, and we think there's an opportunity to build something 10x better, we are going to go for it. And then the question becomes, well, is there an efficient way to grow, then we are going to think about that and if we have an advantage there. And then finally, what's the path towards building a very large cash flow generating business that will maximize total profit dollars in the long run. And I think that's kind of the sequencing of how we thought about things. I think so far, we've made good decisions in grocery and a lot of these paths, I think you're seeing some of the combination or the middle of impact of the results in this quarter. But we've got a long ways to go and we have to keep making good decisions.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morton: Thank you. Two questions, if I can. One, start with for Tony and then the second for Ravi. On the advertising business, kind of following up to the prior question. How do you feel about your product's ability to serve some of the larger enterprises that goes for the QSRs, who kind of demand sophisticated solutions, but also now moving into the grocery business? In our conversations with CPGs, there's a concern about incrementality in advertising for grocery retail marketplace -- retail media networks because the fact that there's not a lot of unit growth there. So whoever can win the incrementality measurement kind of like wins the market for advertising. So curious to how you think about your product there. And then just second for Ravi. Really impressive levels of operating leverage. Just curious if maybe some details of the drivers behind it? Like is this like Dash might be hitting some type of maturity, natural like attrition in the employee base. And like if this is kind of a level we should think about going forward and how operating expenses philosophy could maybe change there? Thank you so much.\nTony Xu: So to your first question, I think I really agree with the premise of the customer research that you did, which is that incrementality obviously, is a huge driver of return on ad spend. And I think that's why, at least my view and our company's view on advertising is the most important thing about building a highly incremental advertising business is to build the biggest and most robust marketplace and not to confuse the sequence or the order of operations there. And so when our grocery business is growing more than doubling year-on-year, I think that's a good start, especially relative to other choices in the marketplace from an advertiser's perspective. But look, I mean, there's a lot of work to be done. I think we have a long ways to go in building out our advertising product. We are super excited about, I think, the growth we've seen. We are even more excited about I think the amount of demand that is coming into the ecosystem for a product like ours, where I think they recognize in addition to our growth and especially at our scale, they also see the opportunity across different categories. And so there's a lot of excitement both from enterprise merchants, whether it's in the restaurant category or in the non-restaurant categories as well as from advertisers. And so we got a lot of work to do. We are not certainly pleased with where we are with the product that's usually how we feel about all of our products. But I think we've got a lot more to go. Certainly, in advertising, it's been a 2.5 year effort. I think it's already amongst, I think, some of the most desired online advertising platforms. Yes, I think we\u2019ve a very, very long road ahead.\nRavi Inukonda: Mike, on your second point on the efficiency and leverage that you're seeing in the business. I mean you're right. I mean really pleased with the performance. Really proud of the team's execution here. I think what you're seeing is a combination of a couple of things. One, I mean, look, I mean, Q3 was a really strong quarter for us, not just across the top line, but also across unit economics. Every single line of business has continued to outperform our expectations, both on volume as well as unit economics. A lot of the EBITDA upside that you're seeing in the business is being driven by that. Two, to your point, we've done a lot of things around operating expenses. Operating expenses, as you could see have been relatively flat for the last 4 quarters in a row. The team has expressed a lot of discipline around the cost structure in general, while we've continued to grow revenue north of 25%, 30% over the same time frame. That said, there are also a couple of things that helped us in Q3. There was a one-time sales tax benefit that helped us in Q3 as well as the continuity of leverage that we are seeing across the board. But when I look ahead, our goal is to continue to drive further leverage in the business, whether it's improvement in unit economics or the fixed cost leverage that you're seeing in the business. And you can see that in the strong Q4 guide that we've given as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael McGovern: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple on the cohort chart. If you look at some of these post-COVID cohorts, it seems as though the slope in trajectory for marketplace GOV is a little bit lower than the steeper slope for pre-COVID cohorts even after the COVID spike. So I'm curious what gives you confidence that you can get the post-COVID cohorts to that same slope in growth? And then also curious what kind of contribution you're seeing from non-restaurant in the newer cohorts versus older cohorts? Do you see newer users ordering more frequently from non-restaurant? Thank you.\nRavi Inukonda: Yes. Let me take both of those. I'll start at the cohort chart, right, like the two big takeaways that at least on the cohort chart is one, I actually look at the annual cohorts going as back as 7 years. I mean, every single cohort still continues to grow. And the second one is, if you actually look at the 2023 cohorts, in fact, it's the second best cohort that we've ever had, second only to the Jan '20 cohort, which obviously had some impact from COVID. What you see in the underlying cohorts is as we are continuing to improve the selection as we are making the quality of the product better as the service levels continue to increase, we are seeing strength across all the cohorts that we operate in. When I look at the newer cohorts from an order frequency perspective, in fact, the newer cohorts are starting out at a higher level than many of the older cohorts are starting out. And to your second point around what is the contribution from both restaurants as well as new verticals, the behavior that we've seen from user base is, the number of users that use both restaurants as well as new verticals, that number continues to increase every single quarter. The impact that's having on the business is that's lifting overall engagement of the cohorts up. We are starting to see that in the order frequency for the entire cohort. Again, to be very clear, we are not trying to drive the order frequency of just restaurants or new verticals, the way we think about it is how do we bring more users back, which is helping us drive overall users at a double-digit rate. How do we get them to use the product more, which is what's being reflected in the overall order frequency going up. In fact, I mean, we are very pleased with the progress, and this is contributing to the strong growth that you've seen over the last couple of years.\nMichael McGovern: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Boone: Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to operating expenses and specifically sales and marketing. It continues to be very efficient. I understood you guys called out Dasher acquisition costs in the letter. But is there anything you can share on customer acquisition costs just as DoorDash's awareness continues to be higher? And then for my second question, I wanted to ask about the elasticity of grocery delivery costs. Tony, you've mentioned the customer cost out a couple of times in your past responses. What are the largest levers you have to pull to make grocery delivery cheaper for the consumer? Thanks so much.\nRavi Inukonda: Let me take the first one on sales and marketing, and Tony, if you were to take the second one. Yes, you're right. I mean, we've seen a ton of leverage on the sales and marketing in general. One of the biggest areas where we've driven a ton of leverage is Dasher. For us, whenever we think about efficiency in the business, it always starts with product. We've done a ton on the logistics side over the last couple of years. We've redesigned the Dasher app. We have given Dashers the opportunity to both own by time as well as own by effort. The combination of both of those things, what that does is it improves retention, it improves order frequency on the dasher side. We are seeing retention on Dashers go up. We are seeing engagement levels go up. The effect that's having on the P&L is we're seeing leverage on both Dasher pay as well as the Dasher acquisition cost. Second, to your specific point around consumer acquisition, we operate the business to a payback period, we are seeing healthy unit economics. We are seeing the unit economics continue to grow. As long as we are comfortable with the payback period, our goal is to continue to drive new user adoption. In fact, order [ph] was driving the overall growth in MAUs is they're continuing to see still healthy levels of user acquisition.\nTony Xu: Hey, Andrew, with respect to your second question about lowering the costs of grocery delivery. I mean I think there's -- there are quite a few dimensions. I probably won't be able to share in much detail about all of the initiatives we are working on. But it starts with, obviously, how do you create the lowest possible cost structure for everybody involved. If you can do that, I think we can all agree that we all have then the choice of to what degree we actually want to lower the cost of the program. And obviously, we always want to continuously lower the cost of the program, so that we can drive greater and greater adoption and engagement in a way that still makes sense for the business, especially when it comes to maximizing total profit dollars in the long run. But I think there's other things, too. And so you should expect to see us continue to work on co-creating interesting products that haven't yet been built together with grocers and really just continue to solve all of the different challenges that they have. And hopefully, it won't just lower the cost of delivery for grocers on DoorDash, but also for grocers through their first-party channels and their in-store businesses as well.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to thank our speakers for today's presentation, and thank you all for joining us. This now concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ravi Inukonda",
            "content": "Ross, on your third question around grocery. I mean, look, we are really pleased with the performance of the grocery business. Our focus over the last couple of years has been how do we increase the usage? How do we increase the adoption of not just our grocery business, but really, in fact, the entire new verticals, all of the categories that we operate in? What we are seeing in the business today is a couple of things, right? One is more number of users are ordering from both restaurants as well as new verticals. And that's driving two things. We are seeing the new verticals business overall accelerate from the prior quarter. As well as when you look at the grocery business itself on the GOV to the specific question you asked, our GOV has doubled year-on-year. If you look at that paired with the efficiency that we've seen in the business, we've driven a ton of efficiency across the business. In fact, when I look at the unit economics, there's been a dramatic improvement in unit economics. You have to realize we have a strategic advantage because we have a network of consumers. We have a network of Dashers already built out, and that's allowing us to improve unit economics at a much faster pace. For us, the way we operate the business is we look at signals around retention. We look at signals around order frequency. We look at signals around unit economics. We continue to be very pleased with the improvement across all three. Our goal is to continue to invest behind improving selection, improving the product quality because our strong belief is that this is going to be a strong long-term ROI generating business for us. Yes, Deepak, maybe just to add a couple of thoughts to what Tony talked about. Look, I mean we've had a phenomenal year so far, what we are seeing both on the top line as well as the bottom line. Part of that is, in fact, being driven by all the investments we made, whether it's on the product side or investments in new verticals as well as the investments we've made in international over the last couple of years. What we are seeing is we are seeing really strong growth across all lines of business that we operate in. These categories that we operate in are large. There's really lots of customer problems, as Tony talked about, that we need to continue to work on and improve. Our goal and philosophy is we will continue to invest as long as we see good signal on both volume as well as unit economics, because this is the blueprint for us to drive really strong free cash flow in the many years to come in our business. Let me take the first one on take rate and then I'll let Tony chime in on the second one. Look, I mean, we are not managing the business to a specific margin target, let alone a margin across any line of the P&L. What you're seeing on the take rate side is, if you actually look at the underlying drivers of the business across the various lines of business, the net revenue margin has actually increased sequentially as well as year-on-year. What you're seeing on the output is really the mix shift of various lines of business. If you recall the comments that we made earlier, new verticals, our international business is actually growing faster than our restaurant business. And you're really seeing the mix shift of those two businesses, which are still early in terms of their journey starting to take impact from an overall take rate perspective. That said, our goal is always how do we find efficiencies across every line of the P&L and using that efficiency to continue to reinvest back in the business to drive growth. And we did that exactly the same in this quarter, right. We found a lot of efficiencies as was a good contributor to the revenue upside that you're seeing in the business, we use that to continue to drive efficient growth, which gave a result of some of the accelerated growth that you're seeing in the business. Eric, just to add to what Tony said, really on the New York City, one, we've gotten a couple of questions about this as well. That is not live yet. We do expect 2 year back from the judge at any point, just like everybody else. Our goal and philosophy and how do we respond to some of these changes has always been the first and foremost priority is to drive efficiency in every market that we operate in because our goal is to ensure we have sustainable unit economics. To the extent we are not able to meet our goals around unit economics, we do realize there's going to be increased cost in the system. Like Tony talked about, we don't think it's great because that just reduces the transaction activity across the ecosystem, which means lower sales for merchants as well as internal lower earnings for Dashers. And from the financial impact perspective itself, any impact from New York City ruling in Q4, we've included that in our EBITDA guidance that we've given. Our goal is to manage the business to be within that range that we've talked about. Doug, just a few more points to what Tony touched on, and then I'll talk about the second question that you asked. We obviously have a lot of signal in the business. I mean we watch this very closely. When I look at the underlying cohorts, I mean they're really strong. If you look at the performance of not just Q3, but actually the first 9 months of the year, cohorts continue to improve, and I look at retention, it's very stable. Our users, in fact, at our scale are growing double digits. Order frequency, like we talked about earlier, continues to grow. So we are very pleased with the performance of the business and a lot of strength that we are seeing in the business. To your second point around GAAP profitability itself, as we've mentioned before, GAAP net income in and of itself is not an explicit target that we are managing the business towards. Financial has always been how do we maximize the long-term free cash flow in the business. And what you're truly seeing in the business today is every single line of business is becoming more efficient. We've dramatically improved the unit economics across the restaurant business, new verticals as well as our international business. I do expect every business to be profitable over time. And as and when that happens, the overall business is going to get to be GAAP net income positive as well. But that's not an explicit target that we are driving the business towards. Mike, on your second point on the efficiency and leverage that you're seeing in the business. I mean you're right. I mean really pleased with the performance. Really proud of the team's execution here. I think what you're seeing is a combination of a couple of things. One, I mean, look, I mean, Q3 was a really strong quarter for us, not just across the top line, but also across unit economics. Every single line of business has continued to outperform our expectations, both on volume as well as unit economics. A lot of the EBITDA upside that you're seeing in the business is being driven by that. Two, to your point, we've done a lot of things around operating expenses. Operating expenses, as you could see have been relatively flat for the last 4 quarters in a row. The team has expressed a lot of discipline around the cost structure in general, while we've continued to grow revenue north of 25%, 30% over the same time frame. That said, there are also a couple of things that helped us in Q3. There was a one-time sales tax benefit that helped us in Q3 as well as the continuity of leverage that we are seeing across the board. But when I look ahead, our goal is to continue to drive further leverage in the business, whether it's improvement in unit economics or the fixed cost leverage that you're seeing in the business. And you can see that in the strong Q4 guide that we've given as well. Yes. Let me take both of those. I'll start at the cohort chart, right, like the two big takeaways that at least on the cohort chart is one, I actually look at the annual cohorts going as back as 7 years. I mean, every single cohort still continues to grow. And the second one is, if you actually look at the 2023 cohorts, in fact, it's the second best cohort that we've ever had, second only to the Jan '20 cohort, which obviously had some impact from COVID. What you see in the underlying cohorts is as we are continuing to improve the selection as we are making the quality of the product better as the service levels continue to increase, we are seeing strength across all the cohorts that we operate in. When I look at the newer cohorts from an order frequency perspective, in fact, the newer cohorts are starting out at a higher level than many of the older cohorts are starting out. And to your second point around what is the contribution from both restaurants as well as new verticals, the behavior that we've seen from user base is, the number of users that use both restaurants as well as new verticals, that number continues to increase every single quarter. The impact that's having on the business is that's lifting overall engagement of the cohorts up. We are starting to see that in the order frequency for the entire cohort. Again, to be very clear, we are not trying to drive the order frequency of just restaurants or new verticals, the way we think about it is how do we bring more users back, which is helping us drive overall users at a double-digit rate. How do we get them to use the product more, which is what's being reflected in the overall order frequency going up. In fact, I mean, we are very pleased with the progress, and this is contributing to the strong growth that you've seen over the last couple of years. Let me take the first one on sales and marketing, and Tony, if you were to take the second one. Yes, you're right. I mean, we've seen a ton of leverage on the sales and marketing in general. One of the biggest areas where we've driven a ton of leverage is Dasher. For us, whenever we think about efficiency in the business, it always starts with product. We've done a ton on the logistics side over the last couple of years. We've redesigned the Dasher app. We have given Dashers the opportunity to both own by time as well as own by effort. The combination of both of those things, what that does is it improves retention, it improves order frequency on the dasher side. We are seeing retention on Dashers go up. We are seeing engagement levels go up. The effect that's having on the P&L is we're seeing leverage on both Dasher pay as well as the Dasher acquisition cost. Second, to your specific point around consumer acquisition, we operate the business to a payback period, we are seeing healthy unit economics. We are seeing the unit economics continue to grow. As long as we are comfortable with the payback period, our goal is to continue to drive new user adoption. In fact, order [ph] was driving the overall growth in MAUs is they're continuing to see still healthy levels of user acquisition."

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Hi, Nikhil, it's Tony. Maybe I'll start and Ravi, feel free to chime in. On the first part of the question, I mean you're absolutely right. I think we saw a phenomenal quarter where frankly, every line of business has accelerated in growth and improved in its unit economics. And that's impressive, especially given the fact that we're a lot larger today than we were a quarter ago and certainly a year ago. In terms of the U.S. restaurant business or the marketplace in general, I mean, a few phenomenon are going on, but really it's the result of product improvements we've made. Whether you look a quarter ago or a year ago, we've added selection to the platform on the restaurant side, and we've added a lot of selection on the non-restaurants front, literally going from 0 nearly 3 years ago to a multibillion-dollar business that's at scale now growing fast and contributing quite significantly. And we have over 100,000 stores on the platform that are outside of restaurants. And when you look outside of restaurants and into the convenience or grocery or alcohol segments, almost half of new customers that come into the industry in the U.S. come to DoorDash first. And so that's certainly adding in terms of the selection. Second, we've continued to improve the quality of service, whether it's our timeliness, our speed, our accuracy. Third, we've improved the affordability of the programs, both for our non-DashPass members as well as for our DashPass cohorts. And fourth, we've improved customer support all along the way. And so it's really the result of many years of work on the fundamentals and mastery of that and continuing to see opportunities to continue improving the product, both in terms of efficiencies and just product quality to the customer that's leading to the growth of all of the lines of business in the U.S., and that's what you kind of saw culminate in some of the numbers that we reported in Q3. I think with respect to the second question, it's -- I think we've -- our business has always been very dynamic in terms of all of the headwinds and tailwinds it's faced in the 10 years that we've been building DoorDash. And that's certainly been true in the last 3 years. Obviously, we lived through a global pandemic. We lived through peak pandemic. We have lived through peak inflation. We've lived through lots of other macro factors, including some of the ones impacting us today. And I think it's important to remind ourselves of a few things. While it's virtually impossible to estimate or isolate the quantum impact of any one of these macro factors, I think it's a lot easier to think about things that we do control. And as mentioned in the answer to the previous question, we've continued to improve our product. And that's certainly within our control and as dynamic, if not more dynamic, than some of the macro changes that we face. I think, second, we benefit from the fact that our first category, the restaurants category, stems in the sense that while sure, maybe not every meal has to be eaten when it comes to delivery or takeout, but when you think about every category that lends itself towards convenience, and we all know that convenience only lends itself towards the direction of greater convenience. Food is the most resilient and highest frequency category. I mean, this is true in every line of eCommerce. In fact, if you look at our cohort performance, which we talked a little bit about in our shareholder letter this quarter, you see that virtually every single cohort, including those that just joined our platform a couple of months ago are doing way better than any of the cohorts even during the pandemic. And so I think as you see that behavior across every line of -- every segment of customers every cohort across time, I think you start to gain a different picture of just the fact of the product improvements as well as the number of shots on goal that we get to take relative to others in capturing that customer. And the final comment I'd make is, in spite of our performance and our market leadership, we are still a tiny fraction of what's addressable. I mean in the U.S. restaurants category, as 1 example, we are less than double-digit percentage sales of the industry. I think you looked globally within restaurants, we are a much tinier single-digit percentage. And if we included all the other categories that we now entered, we are barely noticeable. And so I think we have a long runway left. We have a lot more work to do to get our product to where we would like it to be. But I think the product improvements that we've made in the years leading up to these moments have certainly helped us build a product that endures. Great. Hey, Ross. I'll do my best to take them the first two in order and maybe I'll let Ravi take the third one. So I think the first question was around international. I mean you're absolutely right. We are very excited about our execution on the international front. We continue to grow at multiples of what we see around the world, virtually across any geography. That doesn't mean that we are pleased yet with where our product is. We still have a lot of room left to go. But I think it does stem from why our outperformance has occurred, which is I think the hallmarks at any great marketplace have the fundamental characteristics of great retention order frequency and unit economics. And I think when you look at our international business or our new categories business or a restaurant business, you see all of these characteristics present. And that's why we've been very interested in leaning in and making the investments that we have at size, at scale, because of what we see. And the international business continues to see those points of execution. I think if we remind ourselves even a couple of years ago of the investment thesis behind our partnership with Wolt, it really centered on two big pieces. One of which was here is a business that has leading world-class retention and order frequency, and the question is, can we invest behind that in a concentrated way and hopefully add to the excellent execution that they've already seen. And so far, the answer has been yes to that. In fact, Miki and the team now runs our entire portfolio, certainly the Wolt portfolio as well as the DoorDash portfolio outside of the United States. And the second part of the thesis was that there is a long runway for growth in a lot of these countries, and we continue to see that, too. In the 27 countries outside of the U.S. that we operate in, we are in some ways behind where the U.S. is from a penetration perspective and also product adoption perspective. There just is a lot more population we have to address. There are more merchant partners we've yet to partner with. There's a lot more customer problems given the fact that some of these places are a little bit behind from a technology footprint. And so there's a lot of work to do, but it also means that there's a lot of runway ahead. And I think that's why you've seen continued momentum, and it's adding now to the overall growth of the company. I think your second question was around some of the recent discussions externally around a certain class of drugs. First and foremost, I hope that they actually work these drugs. As a former scientist, I'm a big believer, whenever a great science can actually meet the challenges of its time and I do think that they're solving a worthy problem. So first and foremost, for the patients, I hope that they work for the long-term. Second, we don't see any immediate or noticeable impacts in the business relative to, I guess, what the commentary may be out there about this class of drugs. And I think this kind of goes a little bit to the first question that was asked, which is it's been really hard to size any one macroeconomic factor, whether it's a headwind, a tailwind, a side wind. I think instead, what we focused on is just continued improvement on our product velocity, product quality and execution. And I think that the dynamic changes we make in our product can outweigh many of the macro factors that may be at play. Sure. Deepak, maybe I can start and take the questions and then Ravi, feel free to chime in. The first question, which stems on '24 and some of the initiatives that we are thinking about. First, our goal is to grow and to empower local economies. So we are always looking for problems to solve and jobs to be done. And obviously, we want to make sure that we have a strong point of view where we can do it at least 10x better than, however, the problem is currently being solved. And so when we looked at, if we rewound the clock for instance to 2019, we were thinking quite a lot about what other problems we could solve. And many of the problems that we actually heard came from our customers directly. I'll give a few examples. When I came to consumers, a lot of the challenges that we had heard were really making sure that we can help solve their other problems. Again, because we started in the restaurants category, which has the highest frequency of activity and the fact that we would show up to many consumers' doors many times a week, I think consumers started asking the question, well, what else can you do for me? And similarly for merchants, I think there were many questions that they wanted our help with, this is even well before the pandemic of how can they become an omni-channel business. And that's why we certainly made further investments into products like DoorDash Drive, but also started the creation of DoorDash Storefront, which has continued to serve various merchant cohorts and segments. And we continue to build further services as we think about how can we help a merchant build their first-party channel as much as we help build their third-party channel of DoorDash. And as I kind of keep thinking along the years, I mean, advertising came in that way as well. Many merchants as well as advertisers that are new to our ecosystem kind of approached us and said, hey, it looks like you have a high frequency setup with the largest number of local commerce business where you can measure everything very, very closely and directly. Is there a way in which you can be more useful, I think, to all of the audiences? And that's kind of how we thought about all of the different problems. When I think about '24 or '25 or '26, that's generally how we think about things, too, where we start with certainly our core set of businesses, which today is five businesses, where in 2019, it was closer to one business. And so it's a little bit more varied now and complicated in terms of thinking about all the different opportunities because we believe each one of these five businesses are still actually in their earliest innings, even the U.S. restaurants business. But we are also looking at opportunities to always solve more problems. And I hope that as we listen to our audiences more deeply and can get and operate at a lower level of detail, we will actually be able to pick up new problems to solve. Now we always do this in a fairly disciplined way. Again, I think at DoorDash, we really believe in investing appropriately towards the stage of the project. And so usually, when we are solving these problems and we have many of these experiments going on, we tend to take fairly small bets. And it's only until we believe that we've nailed product market fit as well as finding an efficient way to grow, do we actually concentrate behind that bet and go all in for it. And so that's how we are thinking about '24 in that way, too. I think your second question was around the continued growth in engagement and frequency of our customer base in restaurants even at our current scale. Well, I think there's a lot of things that drive this. I think sometimes when we think about businesses like our oldest business, the U.S. restaurants business, we tend to think that perhaps it's closer to the ninth inning of progress versus the third inning of progress. And I tend to think, at least when I talk to our customers, that we are way closer towards the third inning than the ninth inning. And we just have a lot more work to do in terms of making improvements to the product. There isn't one single thing that we're doing that's yielding, I think, some of the improvements that you're seeing in the results. But really, it's years of working on the selection, the quality of service, the affordability of the program, the added value to our DashPass members as well as improved customer support, that's producing some of the results today. It will be really hard candidly to look backwards and say, \"hey, in which year did the product work actually lead to the results that led to this quarter's efforts\". But I think instead, what we do is, we are always trying to make continued improvement. And I think whenever we've taken that focus, we've surprised ourselves to the upside of how much more there is to go as well as the compounding effects that can happen over time. And in terms of your second question about consumer behavior, given some of the app changes that we announced earlier this summer. I mean we continue to see, I guess, more confirmatory evidence that consumers really like the changes. And I think it's usually pretty rare to see this because whenever you make a pretty sizable change like the one that we made to our consumer app, you tend to get a, who moved my cheese reaction. And I think instead, we actually saw behavior that suggested the opposite where customers were naturally shopping across different categories. And I think one of the drivers of this was that we actually made sure that our progress within each vertical was fairly robust in terms of the level of product market fit that we wanted to achieve before we actually redesigned the entire app experience such that we weren't reorienting consumers to something that we were pushing upon them, but rather it was meeting them where they want it to be given that they were pulling us in terms of the demand that they naturally suggested and showed across each line of business. So we are seeing, as I mentioned before, customers continuing to cross-shop across different categories quite naturally and those numbers continue to increase. We are seeing many -- for many consumers, the first interaction with DoorDash actually tends to be sometimes outside of the restaurant category. And I think these are some of the factors that have contributed to the fact that when you look outside of restaurants and you look at the convenience, grocery, alcohol segments, customers that are adopting eCommerce in these categories for the first time, about half of them are coming to DoorDash first. Yes. Hey, Eric, it's Tony. I'll start and feel free, Ravi, to chime in. I think in general, we have the same point of view on the regulatory landscape today as we had shockingly even 10 years ago, which is that, by and large, governments, lawmakers, regulators, they actually want to work productively with companies like ourselves to really co-create, I think, what the future of work and future of labor will be. And if you think about it, the reason why tens of millions of Dashers have come to the DoorDash platform over time or millions come to our platform every single month or the fact that the DoorDash Dasher app is actually one of the most downloaded consumer apps on the Apple iTunes store is because they simply don't earn enough income from the full time jobs that they do have. 90% of our Dashers Dash fewer than 10 hours a week. The average Dasher does 3 to 4 hours a week, over 80% plus of them have full time jobs. And so they're really seeing DoorDash as a bridge between what income they earn today and the income that they hope to earn to meet the cost of living. And so -- and I think that most regulators actually understand this point, but we -- our hypothesis 10 years ago and kind of our views updating to this day has always been that there might be a handful of jurisdictions, who probably don't want to work productively with businesses and support this new paradigm and instead, candidly create policy that's just bad policy that will achieve unintended consequences that go counter to their goals. And when we think the New York City legislation or proposed legislation is one of those bodies, we see similar activities in Seattle. But when you, again, count up all of the regulatory discussions, I think it still favors kind of our original hypothesis, which is outside of a handful of jurisdictions. Most governments, lawmakers and regulators want to work productively with companies like DoorDash to do the right thing for Dashers. Sure. I can start on the first question, and Ravi, feel free to chime in and also take the second question. With respect to the macro dynamics, again, I think it's just really, really hard to size any one of these things. And I think when you sum it all up and as you mentioned, there's lots of things going on in the world today, with the economy, with other events across the globe. And there's certainly puts and takes, I think, to each one of these things. And I think that when -- it's not just the fact that we have product improvements that I think that has helped out way and helped execute very efficiently and continue to grow at higher rates even at our increased scale. It's also the fact that, when you look at every category of spend, food is one that everyone has to spend in. Sure, one may argue that you don't have to spend it on delivery, but what we tend to see is that there's also the macro trend of convenience increasing in the direction of greater convenience. And so if someone has some dollars to spend, it tends to start with the category of the highest frequency where they also seek convenience. And there's just more opportunities to do that given that someone consumes food 20 to 25 times a week. So we are not seeing any of the activity perhaps that I think some other categories in commerce are seeing, but I think it's really multifaceted. There's the product improvements there's the fact that people have to spend on food, and it tends to, therefore, lend itself towards the category where for eCommerce, it's the most resilient and the highest frequency. I mean, you can say this for the past 60 years, which obviously has a lot of macro dynamics as well. And you see that in only 2 out of the 60 years, I think, did the restaurant industry in the U.S., at least ever decline. And so I think it gives you a sense of the robustness of this category. And then I think the final point is we are still a lot earlier than people think in the category than perhaps our scale suggests. And that means that we are not where we need to be at in terms of where our selection of merchants are, whether it's restaurants or new categories, the affordability of the program, the quality of the service and our customer support. We have to make improvements in all areas. Sure. I mean -- okay, we can take many flavors of this question because, I mean, this is probably something that I spend the majority of my time on, which is initiative and product reviews, because I do think it's really hard to apply the correct judgment certainly correctly every time, depending on the phase of the project. And -- but take a few instances, right? For instance, we really didn't -- one of the first choices we made on grocery was, well, what's the right product to build. And I think there were many external beliefs of perhaps what you have to build in order to create a sustainable grocery business. But we took the view of what is the actual problems left to be solved, first and foremost, coming from our customers. And one of the things that we heard, for example, was that while what's really frustrating about grocery delivery is that the items that either perish the fastest or that we consume as consumers the most frequently. So think about your berries or your milk or your eggs or your cereals or your coffees. It's really annoying in the middle of the week to have to go back into the store and somehow go and get it. Whereas for other types of shopping behavior, if I'm already out on the weekends anyway, and I'm buying other things for the week, maybe it's less of a big deal. And so the first product we've built was actually to solve a smaller basket topic use case, which really introduced ourselves to consumers and helping address a problem we heard. And then I think had the byproduct of introducing ourselves to grocers, too, because this was a use case that they hadn't been investing that much into. And then I think it surprised everyone how large that opportunity occurred. So that's like one version of this, which is before we kind of just look at what everyone else is doing, that's first and foremost, start by building the correct product. And I think building the correct product has a lot of implications on do we use engineers and business people and other functions correctly and therefore, get the most out of the team's potential. I think there's a version of that shows up. I think number two, another example would be, while we didn't really spend much on marketing when it came to building the grocery business. Now Ravi echoed some of the kind of reasons why because, well, one, we do have the largest audience of local commerce customers coming to our app shopping as well as just coming to the app and including those that don't shop. And so we had a bit of a benefit there. But at the same instance, we also didn't want to invest in marketing because the product wasn't good enough yet. And so I think those are two, I guess, examples I would call out where you have to make the right call on how to make the most efficient use of your resources. And first and foremost, for us, it starts with solving the right customer problem correctly. And whenever we see something that's not being solved correctly, and we think there's an opportunity to build something 10x better, we are going to go for it. And then the question becomes, well, is there an efficient way to grow, then we are going to think about that and if we have an advantage there. And then finally, what's the path towards building a very large cash flow generating business that will maximize total profit dollars in the long run. And I think that's kind of the sequencing of how we thought about things. I think so far, we've made good decisions in grocery and a lot of these paths, I think you're seeing some of the combination or the middle of impact of the results in this quarter. But we've got a long ways to go and we have to keep making good decisions. So to your first question, I think I really agree with the premise of the customer research that you did, which is that incrementality obviously, is a huge driver of return on ad spend. And I think that's why, at least my view and our company's view on advertising is the most important thing about building a highly incremental advertising business is to build the biggest and most robust marketplace and not to confuse the sequence or the order of operations there. And so when our grocery business is growing more than doubling year-on-year, I think that's a good start, especially relative to other choices in the marketplace from an advertiser's perspective. But look, I mean, there's a lot of work to be done. I think we have a long ways to go in building out our advertising product. We are super excited about, I think, the growth we've seen. We are even more excited about I think the amount of demand that is coming into the ecosystem for a product like ours, where I think they recognize in addition to our growth and especially at our scale, they also see the opportunity across different categories. And so there's a lot of excitement both from enterprise merchants, whether it's in the restaurant category or in the non-restaurant categories as well as from advertisers. And so we got a lot of work to do. We are not certainly pleased with where we are with the product that's usually how we feel about all of our products. But I think we've got a lot more to go. Certainly, in advertising, it's been a 2.5 year effort. I think it's already amongst, I think, some of the most desired online advertising platforms. Yes, I think we've a very, very long road ahead. Hey, Andrew, with respect to your second question about lowering the costs of grocery delivery. I mean I think there's -- there are quite a few dimensions. I probably won't be able to share in much detail about all of the initiatives we are working on. But it starts with, obviously, how do you create the lowest possible cost structure for everybody involved. If you can do that, I think we can all agree that we all have then the choice of to what degree we actually want to lower the cost of the program. And obviously, we always want to continuously lower the cost of the program, so that we can drive greater and greater adoption and engagement in a way that still makes sense for the business, especially when it comes to maximizing total profit dollars in the long run. But I think there's other things, too. And so you should expect to see us continue to work on co-creating interesting products that haven't yet been built together with grocers and really just continue to solve all of the different challenges that they have. And hopefully, it won't just lower the cost of delivery for grocers on DoorDash, but also for grocers through their first-party channels and their in-store businesses as well."

Please note that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Andy Hargreaves. You may begin your conference.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thanks, Briana. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Ravi Inukonda. We will be making forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call being our expectations for our business, financial position, operating performance, market, guidance, strategies, our investment approach, alignment with merchants and Dashers, and the consumer spending environment. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. Many of these uncertainties are described in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in our earnings press release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call is being audio webcasted on our IR website. An audio replay of the call will be available shortly after the call ends. Briana, I will pass it back to you and we can take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Tony and one for Ravi. Tony, can you give a little more color on what categories will be acceleration in U.S non-restaurant verticals in 2Q? Are there any that is sort of at an inflection point of the ESCO, where we can expect healthy contribution to growth over the new few quarters. And then maybe one for Ravi. The illustrative excel cap was very helpful. And can I ask maybe if you kind of like think about Dash in the context of that. Where the company currently is? Do you think you\u2019re in year two or year four in the chart? Or maybe asked another way. Are you at a place right now where the rate of profitability increase in many different businesses is kind of offsetting the rate of losses in a few which could lead to sort of sustained profitability improvement? Or is this sort of a transitory period in which you\u2019re looking for signals before you scale investments in many other products. Thank you so much. Any context you can add would be great.\nTony Xu: Hey, Deepak. Its Tony. I will take the first one on growth outside of restaurants. I mean, hopefully you all saw in our June update when we celebrated 10 years as a company, we actually rolled out one of our biggest product updates this year. And that really, one of the featured things that we shipped was actually the launch of both our grocery and retail tabs. And I think this is another good example of how we do product development in a very disciplined way, which kind of, I think aligns a bit to the sentiments behind your second question where everything effectively stage gated, and we give maximum exposure or investment, once we see that they are ready for primetime. And I think when it comes to a lot of these categories outside of restaurants, I think you saw a lot of that growth for us happened in the first couple of years of the pandemic in which we launched with third-party convenience retailers, whether they be the likes of Walgreens, CVS, 711, and many, many others. But then, over the last 2.5 years, we built a multibillion dollar grocery business from scratch. And it was really ready for primetime exposure. And that's one of the things that you saw, as we now have more non-restaurant stores on the platform in North America versus any other platform. We're growing faster than every other platform and gaining share dramatically in virtually all categories. And certainly -- and very specifically also in grocery. You also see this in retail. We've seen a lot of growth in categories that is even outside of food, whether that be in sporting goods with Dick's Sporting Goods, or office supplies with Office Depot and OfficeMax, or the pet category with PetSmart and Petco, or the Health and Beauty category with Sephora. So a lot of this is happening. And we found ourselves in a position where not only were we seeing very resilient growth in the core U.S restaurants category, at all-time high frequencies, which gives us just more shots and goal to introduce a lot of these new categories. But we also saw the readiness in terms of product market fit from a selection, quality of service and affordability perspective, when it came to our grocery and our retail offerings. And that's why we made the announcement and why we shipped the features that we did in June.\nRavi Inukonda: Deepak, to your second point, maybe taking a step back like what you're seeing in the business is a combination of a couple of things. One, the growth in the business continues to be very strong. In fact, in Q2, growth actually accelerated compared to Q1. Given the business is positive on a unit economics basis, that's driving some of the upside in EBITDA that you're seeing in the business. At the same time, our core restaurant business is continuing to improve in terms of overall profitability, as well as both new verticals as well as international also becoming efficient when you look at the unit economics year-on-year. That's driving the underlying EBITDA upside that you're seeing in the business. But for us, as you know, it's always important that we are constantly looking to reinvest back in the business. We did that in Q2 as well, which drove some of the upside in growth, as well as the category share gains that Tony talked about. Two, as I look forward, our goal is to constantly reinvest because our goal is to build the largest local commerce business possible and referring back to the chart rate, ideally the chart goes on forever, because they're always looking to manage efficiently. They're always looking to reinvest back into business to build the largest local commerce business possible.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Let me try two questions. One high-level question for you. Tony, you talked about solving big problems for local commerce. So could you sketch out what you think are some of those big problems that you've not yet fully or not yet partially addressed, like logistics and marketing? Like, when you think about those problems beyond that, what do you think are the biggest problems for local commerce? And then would you provide any color on just talk about Wolt, the acquisition here we are a year on in, how do you think that's fair to stick on according to plan, better than plan, the year on in, the positive and the negative surprises you've come across? Thank you very much.\nTony Xu: Yes. Hey, Mark. I'll take both of those questions. On the first one, with respect to large problems to solve, I think first -- I think this probably goes without saying, but I think it's worth repeating, just given the resilience or continued resilience, I should say, of the strength of the restaurant delivery business. And even though that business has achieved a great deal, it's still single-digit percentage representation of the U.S restaurants industry in terms of total sales. So I think I don't want to just skip over some of the businesses that we do run today versus just talk exclusively about the invention of new businesses or solving new problems. So I think there's still a lot to solve in our core business, which I believe has many, many years of runway in it. And when we talk about some of these new categories, that's obviously almost starting just many years behind, given the fact that we launched a lot of these new businesses, about 2.5 years ago. So I want to start with that as context, but I think when you talk about a lot of local commerce, I mean, let's think about it. I mean the pandemic in many ways was a very alarming and aggressive wake up call for every business to be an omni-channel business. And I think it -- for a period of time forced physical retailers to exclusively invest in online because that was the only channel available to them. But I think that as we now kind of, especially as e-commerce goes back into a bit of the steady state curve of adoption, I think there's a lot of problems there to solve, I think that there's the world only tends to want to go faster, customer expectations tend to only go in one direction, when it comes to something like delivery, whether that's with food or other types of items beyond food, that is only going to happen at a greater and greater rate, and if you're a physical retail, or you need to think about how you\u2019re going to participate in that. And so there's lots of logistical problems we have to solve in order to do that. And we're investing quite tremendously in building up certainly these partnerships, but also in a lot of infrastructure, so that we can create the tooling with products like DashMart, such that we can work concurrently with all of these retailers so that they can actually compete, I think at the highest scales with global ambitions. So, I think that's a big part of still making sure that last mile delivery can be true, not just for a handful of retailers, but for every retailer, small, medium, and large. Second and beyond this, there's a lot of tools that now local businesses need to invent. I think a lot of times people think, oh, e-commerce, that's just a website, or that's just a mobile app and you're done. Well, actually, everything needs to be rethought, right. For example, if you used to take care of customer support requests inside your store, whether it's a shopping request, or a dining request, well, you can't do that anymore, if the orders are happening through your digital channel. You're going to have to invent customer service in a different way. If you're used to being once very successful buying real estate at the right locations at the right prices and effectively using that as a way to market, well that's no longer good enough. And there's going to be many ways in which you're going to have to think about not only attracting customers, but building repeat relationships with all of the customers that you do have. And so, I think there's lots of problems to solve. But whether that's in logistics, whether that's in customer service, whether that's in, honestly, every part of what you do now needs to turn from physical to digital. That's what all businesses need to do. So there's a lot of work and the roadmap ahead is quite lengthy. Your second question was about Wolt. In short, Wolt is meeting our expectations which are really high to start with. I mean, in general, we tend to have very high expectations of ourselves and I think when you look at the Wolt performance, or the thesis, I should say, starting a couple of years ago before we close the partnership a year ago, it was really betting on a world class team that has achieved the highest retention and order frequency, in other words, build the best product in the world. And whether or not we can keep growing those geographies, which had long runways for growth as well as take some of their exceptional management, and run a global portfolio. And so those are kind of the two thesis involved in a couple of years ago. And on the first point of whether or not we can keep growing, I mean, I think you kind of see it in the growth rates. We're growing at multiples of what anyone else is growing internationally. And we're also improving our unit economics at the same time. And so, I think, from a business perspective, that's really meeting the bar. The second is more of a management perspective. And what you see there is that we'll actually, Mickey and the team actually runs all of DoorDash's markets outside of the U.S. And so I think we're seeing a very, very strong start on that front as well as that team now is taking up a bigger geography. And we now get to split the management bandwidth in the right way, so that we can give international, which is a huge investment area for us the right single threaded focus and do the same for our U.S business as well.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Tony.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nNikhil Devnani: Hey, there. Thank you for taking the question. I had one on the investment framework as well in the letter. So you mentioned kind of a 6-year period of investment and $1 billion spent on U.S restaurants, before it start to generate some cash. When you look at the investment areas you have today, do you expect them to take longer to return and costs more? Because they might be more operationally complex, so there's more incumbents? Or do you expect the return to actually be quicker, because you've already built a strong network of consumers in Dashers? And then maybe a second question. Tony, you've talked about people eating 20 to 25 times a week as the opportunity. What's the ceiling you think on frequency for your business? And kind of the primary constraints between bridging the gap to that point? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yes, all right. Well, Nikhil, maybe I'll take both of those. I think the first is on the -- how we think about investments. And the second is really around where we are on frequency and where it can go. On the first, let me just say, we kind of offered a quantitative framework in the shareholder letter on how we've thought about things. But it was meant as a guide, not as something that is just a formula that always can be applied, right? I mean, sometimes these things take judgment. And so, the answer to your question about our timelines or investment dollars is going to be larger or longer or shorter, or I guess less, it really depends on the problem at hand, right? I mean, obviously, we have a benefit of having the largest local commerce audience that has the greatest frequency, which gives us the most shots on goal. But that doesn't mean that we just win de facto. I mean, we have to still build the best-in-class product for each problem that we're trying to solve. And then I think the benefit of the scale will actually really translate in a way that makes productive sense for all of the audiences and frankly, generate a great return for everybody. And so I don't think there's necessarily one way to think about this. We try our best to play first principles approach to each problem. We obviously want to take advantage where we can, but the way we tend to think about this is, first and foremost, how do we solve a problem that in a way that is significantly better than how incumbents are doing it today, make sure that we are very disciplined in both the product investment as well as the dollar investment in which we stage gate that those investments because precious resources, whether it's the attention we can give in our distribution, or the dollars that we have in our budgets, or frankly, the people that we have working at the company, that's a big consideration. And then the final consideration is whether or not we see an efficient path towards strong long-term economics. And so that's just in general how we think about it, but I wouldn't over rotate necessarily on that being the exact formula that we have to repeat over and again. The second question I think has to do with frequency and its long-term potential. The short answer is we continue to see the numbers grow, right. And I think on the one hand, we -- there's a few ways to look at this. I think, in your question, I think you're kind of saying, well, there's 20 to 25 eating opportunities, be it shopping opportunities on top of that, but we are talking about north of 100 occasions a month. That's certainly I think theoretically, max. And I think that's one way to look at it. We also can look at it from just some of our power users or top decile users are actually doing today. So it's not even a theoretical number. And we think that we can keep growing much, much bigger, I guess, is the short answer. I mean, our top decile users are using our service, a very large number of double-digit times, I guess, is what I would say. And so for us, it's thinking about, well, how do we actually graduate people to that. And the answer is there isn't a silver bullet here, right. It's the combination of the selection of stores, the affordability of the program, the quality of the service, and making sure that we get the efficient -- we can deliver the efficient frontier for each individual user, each individual occasion. And if we can do that these numbers will continue moving up.\nNikhil Devnani: Great. \nRavi Inukonda: And Nikhil just add to what Tony said, right, like our goal is to target track our teams for both unit economics as well as volume. We're comfortable with the timeframe as long as we're making progress across both of those. And if you look at the results of both of our investment areas, we are growing quite nicely as well as the unit economics continue to improve. We obviously want to run these businesses efficiently. We're happy with the progress we've made so far.\nNikhil Devnani: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is now open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Maybe two. Tony, I think you mentioned this earlier as well, but just the frequencies at all time highs and what's traditionally a slower quarter 2Q, just talk about the drivers here now. I guess more is this DashPass users having greater impact, newer cohorts ramping faster, the revamped app, as we talked about. I'm sure it's all of the above, if there's anything to call out, though, that would be interesting on frequency. And then, Ravi, on contribution profit, I think the press release talked about U.S. restaurant marketplace generating annualized $2.4 billion in contribution profit this quarter. So can you just talk about -- and that's essentially all contribution profit for the company. So talk about the margins across nonfood? I think convenience are we sustainably positive there. Talk about grocery, Wolt, any insights there would be helpful. Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yes. So on the first question, in terms of where the growth is coming from, I mean, we are seeing mainly in two big areas, right? One is users and the other is the frequency. And you're right, in that, there is no one individual driver of this. I mean DashPass did have a record quarter. So it continues to achieve on highs. So you're right, as one of the assumptions that, that was one of the drivers. But we're also just seeing stronger and stronger cohorts. I think that this is a question at the -- certainly at the beginning of the pandemic, and certainly at the beginning of the reopening or the first reopening in 2021. But I think what you've seen now for 8 to 10 straight quarters in addition to the output metrics, GOV, the revenue, the input metrics we're seeing are stronger and stronger cohort retention and growth. And that's a combination of offering the best selection, quality, affordability. The new use cases, to your point, around non-restaurants certainly adds to it. But there's also improvements in the core restaurants business as well. So I think all of these things is adding to it. But the short answer to your question, what's driving the growth, it's users and frequency.\nRavi Inukonda: Yes, Ron, just a couple of points there on your second question. I mean, the $2.4 billion contribution that was the U.S. restaurants contribution from Q3 of last year. Obviously, that has grown substantially since that point. What we're seeing in the business is as we continue to improve the underlying product, whether it's adding more selection, improving the quality of the product, that's driving efficiency of all lines of business. What we saw this past quarter, like I mentioned earlier, core restaurants improved in terms of unit economics as well as profitability are both new verticals and international areas improved in terms of unit economics. More specifically, when I look at the new verticals area, last year, we mentioned that third-party convenience was positive on a unit economic basis. It has continued to grow from that point, both grocery as well as DashMart, there's been a step change improvement in the unit economics compared to last year. International business accelerated in the quarter as well as unit economics improved. Again, all of the unit economic improvement we are seeing is being driven by product innovation. We've driven leverage on Dashers costs. We've driven leverage across credits and refunds as well as sales and marketing.\nRon Josey: That\u2019s great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is now open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two questions, if I can. Just first, just following up on Mark's question earlier, can you maybe give us a sense of some of the interesting greenfield investment areas, that might be interesting to you all. It seems like maybe there's -- you're open to things that are perhaps less directly adjacent than some of what we've seen already like advertising or otherwise. Am I misreading that? Anything you can share there? And then the second one is just -- it seems like we're in a sweet spot getting healthy growth and good margins. Clearly, core restaurant business firing on all cylinders and good progress on unit economics of the investment areas. But as you showed in your letter, sometimes unit economics are improving a lot, but as you fuel investment behind that, it could be like a headwind on an absolute basis. Where are we in that cycle with some of these investment areas? Like should we expect while unit economics are getting a lot better, just a step up in investment behind that, that may mute the flow through of that? Like anything you can share on the kind of medium-term outlook for where we are in that cycle there on existing growth investments. Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yes. Maybe I'll take a shot at the first one and maybe say a few things on the second one, too, and then I'll -- and ask Ravi to jump in on the second one as well. I think on the first one, I mean, you're right in the saying that there is no like exact formula of what are the exact adjacent problems to solve when it comes to unlocking local commerce, right? I mean I think if you think about today, even e-commerce is still a minority of overall retail. And then when you look within local commerce, so the small, medium and large physical businesses offline that are trying to come online and kind of compete against maybe digital only or kind of traditional e-commerce players, I mean, they're even further behind, right? And so our mission has always been to grow and to empower these businesses. So we have to, on the one hand, build a marketplace that can drive incremental demand at profitable sales. And on the other hand, we have to give them tools. And so some of these tools are related. But at the end of the day, it's just what does it take to solve the customers' problems. And we think that local businesses can solve a lot of the problems when it comes to consumption that traditional e-commerce businesses solve. And so we have to just make sure that we can build the tooling to allow them to do that, both through their own channel as well as through ours. I think on the second question, I think one of the important things here is we certainly -- there's kind of like two thoughts I have on your question. The first is, we don't get to control when product market fit occurs, right? And so a lot of the -- even though we would love to have prescribed organizational time lines set around every project with a perfect formula that's exactly replicable across all projects, that's not exactly what the customer cares about. The customer is going to vote with their activity, whether or not we've done a good enough job. And so for us, sometimes these things are you move one step forward, a couple of step sideways, one step backwards, three steps forward. And I think that while what we demonstrated in our restaurants business as well as these investment areas is that when you step back and take a look holistically over a multiyear horizon, you get this nice looking up into the right graph, that's not usually what happens in real life, right? So I think it's pretty hard sometimes when you're just making investments during the period, especially as you're searching for product market fit to have any prescribed time lines. But on the flip side, it doesn't mean that you have to bet at all in that period of time either, right? I think a lot of what we are trying to explain in our shareholder letter is just our investment philosophy that we are not just betting at all costs. We are betting when we see signal. And when we see that signal, do we actually scale? This is true in our product development. We didn't release the grocery -- we didn't release maximum exposure to our grocery product until very recently after 2.5 years, we didn't do that for our retail categories either. And we don't do that from a dollars and cents perspective on the P&L either. So I think when it comes to time line, I think judgment is quite important. And I think the most important thing to take away from the shareholder letter is that with a disciplined way in thinking about how to make these investments.\nRavi Inukonda: Lloyd, just to add to what Tony talked about, right, like your second question. For us, we don't focus on the absolute level of investment in terms of the quantum of dollars. Our philosophy has always been, we goal our teams, we goal our lines of business on two metrics, which is demand in terms of volume growth as well as unit economics. As long as both of those are progressing in the right direction according to plan, we are happy to continue to invest because the most important thing in our business is scale, and we've seen that in our restaurant business, we've seen that in our third-party convenience business. Our goal is as long as we're seeing success in terms of volume and the unit economics are continuing to improve, we're going to invest behind our investment areas.\nLloyd Walmsley: Yes, makes sense. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. A couple just on the Dashers side. Can you just talk about the drivers of lower-than-expected acquisition costs in 2Q? And then what makes you think those efficiencies may not continue in the back half? And then with the update recently, any thoughts, early thoughts I know, but on the flexible pay model for Dashers and perhaps any discussion around unit economics for you guys? Thanks.\nRavi Inukonda: Yes, Doug, I'll take both of those. The Dashers acquisition cost itself, in any given quarter, there's some volatility in our Dashers acquisition costs. So I wouldn't read too much into it. Let me give you a few examples. In Q1, we under forecasted volume. So we had to ramp our Dashers actual acquisition spend in the quarter. That's what we saw in Q1. In Q2, we saw a couple of things, right? First, the underlying product improvements we made that helped us in terms of Dashers retention. Number two, we also benefited from seasonality where you have college kids come back during summer. And we see this every single summer. What we said in our letter is we expect the product improvements to continue to bear fruit in the second half, but we don't expect the same level of benefit or efficiency from seasonality. But again, I won't read too much into the quarter-to-quarter movement because there's some inherent volatility in Dashers acquisition. To your second point, the Dasher product change as we made -- that was not a financial move for us. For us it was mostly about offering choice, offering flexibility to Dashers. If you think about our Dashers, really Dashers are at different parts of their journey. Some Dashers are new to the platform where they just want to hit the button go and start earning. There's others who are more experienced, that want to pick and choose the orders that they want to go after. For us it was truly about giving a choice to Dashers to continue to engage with us on the platform, depending on where they are in their journey, less so about a financial move for us. Hopefully that helps.\nDouglas Anmuth: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks, guys. Maybe two. The first one, Tony, can you sort of talk about your 10-year old sort of the oldest, the core U.S. restaurant business. As you sort of think about customers voting with their activity, talk to us about sort of how you break down the forward growth and what you have to invest in to kind of continue to grow that core U.S. restaurant business from here across users, frequency, spend per transaction? How do you continue to get customers to devote more in that core oldest business? And then the second one on the grocery non-restaurant piece in the U.S. Recognize the new app design is having an impact. When do you think about sort of increasing your marketing to bring new users into the funnel for grocery first? Has that started yet? Or is that something to think about in the back half or in '24? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yes. Maybe I can take a shot at those. I think on the first question of growing the U.S. restaurants business. Well, I wish it was just one lever that we'd have to pull. But I mean, we continuously have to work on selection, the quality of the service, the affordability of the programs and our customer support, right? I mean this is one of these businesses where I think it's really easy to make surface level comments about the business, but really the execution happens at the order level. And you have to be better on each one. And for us, I think the criteria to be better, it really goes back to the hallmarks of how we have achieved the scale that we have in the restaurants business in the first place, which is offering the best combination of selection, quality, affordability and service. And so there's certainly a lot of things that we have in the books planned for each one of these areas, but that's really how we always think about building a better product. And we can measure whether or not we're making progress based on our retention and order frequency. And we continue to have the highest retention in order frequency rates amongst any other platform. The second question, I mean, in some ways, some of this is already happening, where we have, to your point, customers may be finding out about DoorDash for the first time through a non-restaurant category whether that's groceries or pets or flowers or some of the retail categories that we discussed earlier. Already outside of the restaurant category, we had tracked more of new customers that are ordering from these non-restaurants for the first time in the industry than any other platform. And I think that's pretty remarkable, given that a lot of these categories for us when we started about 2.5 years ago, which suggests that some of this activity is actually already happening organically. Of course, we are investing in some marketing behind this for sure, and especially as I think we are making the evolution of -- from being a restaurant delivery product to something that delivers your entire city. We're not there yet. Obviously, we have a long ways to go on the selection, the quality and affordability. But I think it's encouraging to see that we already attract more new customers into this field than anyone else and that a lot of customers are coming to us for the first time, not for restaurants.\nRavi Inukonda: I'd just like to what Tony talked about, right? What we saw in the quarter was growth in both users as well as order frequency. Order frequency hit an all-time high, it's growing year-on-year. User growth has also been very strong. The way at least we think about it is, if you think about our platform, we have roughly over 30 million active shoppers on the platform any given month. But if you look at that number over the course of the last year, that number is multiples higher. It's just a fraction of the overall users using the platform, right? That tells you the scope of the opportunity on the user growth side. Order frequency again, very similar. The blended order frequency across the platform is mid-single digits off of the base of more than 100 usable movements. So when I look at both of those, the scope of the opportunity in front of us is large. The good news is, again, what moves both is largely the same. It's improving selection, improving quality, making the product more affordable. So when I look ahead, as we are continuing to innovate on the product, I'm confident that we'll drive growth both across users as well as order frequency.\nBrian Nowak: Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. In reading the letter and some of the answers so far in the call, I just wanted to come back to this concept of signal. If you think about the mix between being a marketplace and being more of a first-party player yourself in e-commerce, and what signal you might be looking for when you think about a business like DashMart and thinking about growing geographic footprint or SKU diversification inside that business as a potential area for investment over the medium to long-term to be a larger, more scaled one key player against the local commerce opportunity? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Yes. So Eric, I'll take that. I think it's important to start with the context of why we even are investing in some of our 1P efforts in the first place, which really comes back to this capability point of making sure that we can enable every small, medium and large physical business to compete effectively and efficiently in the digital world. And at the end of the day, what we are trying to build ultimately is a product that can deliver you everything from your city exactly what you ordered and at around the same price that you would have paid yourself to do that service. But today, that's not where status quo is, right, in terms of, I think, any product, that delivers anything outside of restaurants for sure. And so that's kind of why we invested in DashMarts in the first place. And so it's always in concert of -- with in partnership, excuse me, with our merchant partners of how to make sure that something like DashMart can be a useful service for them. It's not necessarily a signal of, oh, is our 1P now going to take a bigger portion. It's actually instead learning how to do it really well, such that when we work with these third parties and think about inventing some products for the future that this could be one capability set in our back pocket.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRoss Sandler: Thanks, guys. First of all, shout out to Andy or Ravi's idea was to put the SBC table at the bottom of the letter. I appreciate that. But my question, Tony, is about DashPass. So you guys were, I think, the first in the industry to roll out subscription, and it obviously drives a huge amount of value. But now we are at the point in the industry where it's maturing and there's a lot of other subscription services from folks that compete with you guys in grocery, folks that compete with you guys in restaurant, e-commerce companies that compete with you guys. So as you look out into the future of DashPass, do you feel like selection -- in your advantage in selection is enough to continue to differentiate? Or do you think you'll need to add different things to the bundle whether that be like physical retail or, I don't know, digital services, et cetera, to continue to differentiate DashPass? Any thoughts on that? Thanks a lot.\nTony Xu: Yes. So there's -- I mean customer expectations always going in one direction, right? I think except there is plenty of times, and I think that goes for subscription programs, too. But the other thing that goes for subscription programs is the most important thing is usage, right? You want to subscription programs that are really successful are those that get used the most often, which is what drives the value, right? And sometimes that's measured in dollars and cents, that sometimes that's measured in time spent on the service and over time saved from a service and et cetera, right? And so for us, I don't think it's necessarily one advantage, right? I wish if it were just one advantage, then it actually be quite easy to invest from a product perspective. But it's always been thinking about the selection, the quality, the affordability of the program such that we can drive the north star of usage. And so we are going to always have to invest to make sure that our products are getting us the most. I think the benefit for us is that the category that we started in eating, which we've talked about on this call for a bit, is the largest and most frequent, which means that it does have the largest usage from both I think how people think about spending their discretionary income to just what they do physically to survive. And so I think that was a very natural candidly reason why we started in the restaurant delivery category. But as we expand and try to be more useful to the cities that we operate in and all of the different types of categories of retail that we participate with, we are going to have to keep thinking about investing more into things that will continue to drive the usage of our subscription program, which is ultimately what will drive the value of DashPass.\nRavi Inukonda: And, Ross, just to add to what Tony said, right, like what you're seeing in the business is as we are continuing to improve the selection and the quality of the business, that's driving MAUs. These MAUs are retaining at a higher rate. They're ordering more. As they order more, they habituate on the platform and graduate to DashPass. In fact, if you look at Q2, DashPass has a record quarter where subscribers grew not just quarterly but on an annual basis, it was one of the best quarters ever for DashPass for us.\nRoss Sandler: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael McGovern with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael McGovern: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe a couple for Ravi on guidance. It looks like even at the upper end of guidance for Q3, we're expecting a little bit of a quarter-on-quarter drop in GOV. So I'm just curious, is that just seasonality or anything else to point out there for the quarter-on-quarter drop? And then second question, if I take the upper end of guidance between Q3 and the full year, looks like Q4's EBITDA profit and margin will be in Q4 than at any other point in the year. So just in that upside scenario hitting the upper end of guidance, what are some of the factors that contribute to that?\nRavi Inukonda: Mike, I'll take both of those, right? Like on the guidance point itself, I mean, what we are seeing in the business is, a, obviously, consumer spending continues to be strong, the underlying cohorts continue to be very stable. That's what's giving us confidence to, first of all, bump up the GOV guide for the rest of the year. What you're noticing in Q3 is normal seasonality that we largely see every year. There's nothing more to that outside of seasonality. In terms of EBITDA guidance, I mean, again, like I said earlier, right, the combination of continued improvement in growth for us, the overall business is positive on an unit economic basis, Q4 growth is higher than Q3. You're going to see some upside in EBITDA flow through. Number two, the product improvements that we are making is continued to drive efficiency. But again, important to remember, right, like we're constantly looking to reinvest back in the business. And if we have good opportunities to invest, we are going to continue to drive efficient growth as long as we can stay within our disciplined parameters.\nMichael McGovern: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist. Your line is now open.\nYoussef Squali: Excellent. Thank you so much. So maybe, Tony, going back to the investment letter and the framework that you're putting out there, outside of customers and Dashers and the network that creates, which arguably are super powerful, can you maybe talk about core competencies that you believe that you're kind of leveraging just better than anybody else out there that kind of gives you this potential compare [indiscernible] advantage that's allowing you to grow so much faster? And then, Ravi, I think you talked or you mentioned that your GOV, your aggregate GOV accelerated year-on-year. Was that -- is that statement true for U.S. GOV as well? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yes. So on the first question, I think there's basically like a time line or sequencing, if you will, almost of how to arrive at the answer to your question, which is, first, when it comes to building a product from the very beginning, the -- what allows that product to grow faster relative to someone else's is whether or not we solve the customer's problems better, right? And I think what's hard to see in this business is that it's really a combination of things that a customer is asking us to solve. They're asking us to make sure we can get the right stores and the right items from those stores at the right price point, at the right service level. And obviously, if things go south, that we fix it. And there is no shortcut in many ways and kind of betting on any one of these factors, you kind of have to be better at the combination. And I think that if you can achieve that, then you can have this time line where after a certain point of scale, it translates into a few structural benefits. One of those benefits is recall customers kind of come to us first at the eating app. We are working on that to make that true in every country. But in the United States, that's certainly the starting point. And again, when eating is the starting place where you have the most shots on goal, and Ravi talked about the multiples of the 30 million monthly active shoppers who shop with us once a year. I mean there's an even bigger number than that that comes and just open who doesn't shop at all. And so in many ways, we don't have to acquire any more new customers from external channels. We can just go within our own ecosystem because we started with the largest one, which -- when it comes to consumption, which is eating. Other benefits come from the scale logistics components that you talked about, right, knowing how to operate that really efficiently is something that continues to compound in terms of giving a natural funding source for other types of investments that we want to make. So I think the way I think about this is always the execution starts first, making sure that we can solve a problem better than someone else can so that we can create the best product. That's what generates the growth. And then structurally, over time, what are the things that actually -- can we actually use the product advantage that we built to generate a structural advantage? And I think you're seeing that in both instances, which is why you've seen the resilience the growth in the core restaurant business. It's why you've seen faster growth and share gains in these non-restaurant businesses as well as improving -- or very, very quickly improving unit economics. And that's why we're continuing to invest.\nRavi Inukonda: Youssef, on your second question, orders accelerated from Q1 to Q2, not GOV. And if I break it down by the different lines of business, core U.S. restaurants, even at our scale, the order growth was stable. Both new verticals, International, as Tony just mentioned, they both accelerated from Q1 to Q2.\nYoussef Squali: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you both.\nOperator: In the interest of time, there will be no further questions. With that, we will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ravi Inukonda",
            "content": "Deepak, to your second point, maybe taking a step back like what you're seeing in the business is a combination of a couple of things. One, the growth in the business continues to be very strong. In fact, in Q2, growth actually accelerated compared to Q1. Given the business is positive on a unit economics basis, that's driving some of the upside in EBITDA that you're seeing in the business. At the same time, our core restaurant business is continuing to improve in terms of overall profitability, as well as both new verticals as well as international also becoming efficient when you look at the unit economics year-on-year. That's driving the underlying EBITDA upside that you're seeing in the business. But for us, as you know, it's always important that we are constantly looking to reinvest back in the business. We did that in Q2 as well, which drove some of the upside in growth, as well as the category share gains that Tony talked about. Two, as I look forward, our goal is to constantly reinvest because our goal is to build the largest local commerce business possible and referring back to the chart rate, ideally the chart goes on forever, because they're always looking to manage efficiently. They're always looking to reinvest back into business to build the largest local commerce business possible. And Nikhil just add to what Tony said, right, like our goal is to target track our teams for both unit economics as well as volume. We're comfortable with the timeframe as long as we're making progress across both of those. And if you look at the results of both of our investment areas, we are growing quite nicely as well as the unit economics continue to improve. We obviously want to run these businesses efficiently. We're happy with the progress we've made so far. Yes, Ron, just a couple of points there on your second question. I mean, the $2.4 billion contribution that was the U.S. restaurants contribution from Q3 of last year. Obviously, that has grown substantially since that point. What we're seeing in the business is as we continue to improve the underlying product, whether it's adding more selection, improving the quality of the product, that's driving efficiency of all lines of business. What we saw this past quarter, like I mentioned earlier, core restaurants improved in terms of unit economics as well as profitability are both new verticals and international areas improved in terms of unit economics. More specifically, when I look at the new verticals area, last year, we mentioned that third-party convenience was positive on a unit economic basis. It has continued to grow from that point, both grocery as well as DashMart, there's been a step change improvement in the unit economics compared to last year. International business accelerated in the quarter as well as unit economics improved. Again, all of the unit economic improvement we are seeing is being driven by product innovation. We've driven leverage on Dashers costs. We've driven leverage across credits and refunds as well as sales and marketing. Lloyd, just to add to what Tony talked about, right, like your second question. For us, we don't focus on the absolute level of investment in terms of the quantum of dollars. Our philosophy has always been, we goal our teams, we goal our lines of business on two metrics, which is demand in terms of volume growth as well as unit economics. As long as both of those are progressing in the right direction according to plan, we are happy to continue to invest because the most important thing in our business is scale, and we've seen that in our restaurant business, we've seen that in our third-party convenience business. Our goal is as long as we're seeing success in terms of volume and the unit economics are continuing to improve, we're going to invest behind our investment areas. Yes, Doug, I'll take both of those. The Dashers acquisition cost itself, in any given quarter, there's some volatility in our Dashers acquisition costs. So I wouldn't read too much into it. Let me give you a few examples. In Q1, we under forecasted volume. So we had to ramp our Dashers actual acquisition spend in the quarter. That's what we saw in Q1. In Q2, we saw a couple of things, right? First, the underlying product improvements we made that helped us in terms of Dashers retention. Number two, we also benefited from seasonality where you have college kids come back during summer. And we see this every single summer. What we said in our letter is we expect the product improvements to continue to bear fruit in the second half, but we don't expect the same level of benefit or efficiency from seasonality. But again, I won't read too much into the quarter-to-quarter movement because there's some inherent volatility in Dashers acquisition. To your second point, the Dasher product change as we made -- that was not a financial move for us. For us it was mostly about offering choice, offering flexibility to Dashers. If you think about our Dashers, really Dashers are at different parts of their journey. Some Dashers are new to the platform where they just want to hit the button go and start earning. There's others who are more experienced, that want to pick and choose the orders that they want to go after. For us it was truly about giving a choice to Dashers to continue to engage with us on the platform, depending on where they are in their journey, less so about a financial move for us. Hopefully that helps. I'd just like to what Tony talked about, right? What we saw in the quarter was growth in both users as well as order frequency. Order frequency hit an all-time high, it's growing year-on-year. User growth has also been very strong. The way at least we think about it is, if you think about our platform, we have roughly over 30 million active shoppers on the platform any given month. But if you look at that number over the course of the last year, that number is multiples higher. It's just a fraction of the overall users using the platform, right? That tells you the scope of the opportunity on the user growth side. Order frequency again, very similar. The blended order frequency across the platform is mid-single digits off of the base of more than 100 usable movements. So when I look at both of those, the scope of the opportunity in front of us is large. The good news is, again, what moves both is largely the same. It's improving selection, improving quality, making the product more affordable. So when I look ahead, as we are continuing to innovate on the product, I'm confident that we'll drive growth both across users as well as order frequency. And, Ross, just to add to what Tony said, right, like what you're seeing in the business is as we are continuing to improve the selection and the quality of the business, that's driving MAUs. These MAUs are retaining at a higher rate. They're ordering more. As they order more, they habituate on the platform and graduate to DashPass. In fact, if you look at Q2, DashPass has a record quarter where subscribers grew not just quarterly but on an annual basis, it was one of the best quarters ever for DashPass for us. Mike, I'll take both of those, right? Like on the guidance point itself, I mean, what we are seeing in the business is, a, obviously, consumer spending continues to be strong, the underlying cohorts continue to be very stable. That's what's giving us confidence to, first of all, bump up the GOV guide for the rest of the year. What you're noticing in Q3 is normal seasonality that we largely see every year.

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Hey, Deepak. Its Tony. I will take the first one on growth outside of restaurants. I mean, hopefully you all saw in our June update when we celebrated 10 years as a company, we actually rolled out one of our biggest product updates this year. And that really, one of the featured things that we shipped was actually the launch of both our grocery and retail tabs. And I think this is another good example of how we do product development in a very disciplined way, which kind of, I think aligns a bit to the sentiments behind your second question where everything effectively stage gated, and we give maximum exposure or investment, once we see that they are ready for primetime. And I think when it comes to a lot of these categories outside of restaurants, I think you saw a lot of that growth for us happened in the first couple of years of the pandemic in which we launched with third-party convenience retailers, whether they be the likes of Walgreens, CVS, 711, and many, many others. But then, over the last 2.5 years, we built a multibillion dollar grocery business from scratch. And it was really ready for primetime exposure. And that's one of the things that you saw, as we now have more non-restaurant stores on the platform in North America versus any other platform. We're growing faster than every other platform and gaining share dramatically in virtually all categories. And certainly -- and very specifically also in grocery. You also see this in retail. We've seen a lot of growth in categories that is even outside of food, whether that be in sporting goods with Dick's Sporting Goods, or office supplies with Office Depot and OfficeMax, or the pet category with PetSmart and Petco, or the Health and Beauty category with Sephora. So a lot of this is happening. And we found ourselves in a position where not only were we seeing very resilient growth in the core U.S restaurants category, at all-time high frequencies, which gives us just more shots and goal to introduce a lot of these new categories. But we also saw the readiness in terms of product market fit from a selection, quality of service and affordability perspective, when it came to our grocery and our retail offerings. And that's why we made the announcement and why we shipped the features that we did in June. Yes. Hey, Mark. I'll take both of those questions. On the first one, with respect to large problems to solve, I think first -- I think this probably goes without saying, but I think it's worth repeating, just given the resilience or continued resilience, I should say, of the strength of the restaurant delivery business. And even though that business has achieved a great deal, it's still single-digit percentage representation of the U.S restaurants industry in terms of total sales. So I think I don't want to just skip over some of the businesses that we do run today versus just talk exclusively about the invention of new businesses or solving new problems. So I think there's still a lot to solve in our core business, which I believe has many, many years of runway in it. And when we talk about some of these new categories, that's obviously almost starting just many years behind, given the fact that we launched a lot of these new businesses, about 2.5 years ago. So I want to start with that as context, but I think when you talk about a lot of local commerce, I mean, let's think about it. I mean the pandemic in many ways was a very alarming and aggressive wake up call for every business to be an omni-channel business. And I think it -- for a period of time forced physical retailers to exclusively invest in online because that was the only channel available to them. But I think that as we now kind of, especially as e-commerce goes back into a bit of the steady state curve of adoption, I think there's a lot of problems there to solve, I think that there's the world only tends to want to go faster, customer expectations tend to only go in one direction, when it comes to something like delivery, whether that's with food or other types of items beyond food, that is only going to happen at a greater and greater rate, and if you're a physical retail, or you need to think about how you're going to participate in that. And so there's lots of logistical problems we have to solve in order to do that. And we're investing quite tremendously in building up certainly these partnerships, but also in a lot of infrastructure, so that we can create the tooling with products like DashMart, such that we can work concurrently with all of these retailers so that they can actually compete, I think at the highest scales with global ambitions. So, I think that's a big part of still making sure that last mile delivery can be true, not just for a handful of retailers, but for every retailer, small, medium, and large. Second and beyond this, there's a lot of tools that now local businesses need to invent. I think a lot of times people think, oh, e-commerce, that's just a website, or that's just a mobile app and you're done. Well, actually, everything needs to be rethought, right. For example, if you used to take care of customer support requests inside your store, whether it's a shopping request, or a dining request, well, you can't do that anymore, if the orders are happening through your digital channel. You're going to have to invent customer service in a different way. If you're used to being once very successful buying real estate at the right locations at the right prices and effectively using that as a way to market, well that's no longer good enough. And there's going to be many ways in which you're going to have to think about not only attracting customers, but building repeat relationships with all of the customers that you do have. And so, I think there's lots of problems to solve. But whether that's in logistics, whether that's in customer service, whether that's in, honestly, every part of what you do now needs to turn from physical to digital. That's what all businesses need to do. So there's a lot of work and the roadmap ahead is quite lengthy. Your second question was about Wolt. In short, Wolt is meeting our expectations which are really high to start with. I mean, in general, we tend to have very high expectations of ourselves and I think when you look at the Wolt performance, or the thesis, I should say, starting a couple of years ago before we close the partnership a year ago, it was really betting on a world class team that has achieved the highest retention and order frequency, in other words, build the best product in the world. And whether or not we can keep growing those geographies, which had long runways for growth as well as take some of their exceptional management, and run a global portfolio. And so those are kind of the two thesis involved in a couple of years ago. And on the first point of whether or not we can keep growing, I mean, I think you kind of see it in the growth rates. We're growing at multiples of what anyone else is growing internationally. And we're also improving our unit economics at the same time. And so, I think, from a business perspective, that's really meeting the bar. The second is more of a management perspective. And what you see there is that we'll actually, Mickey and the team actually runs all of DoorDash's markets outside of the U.S. And so I think we're seeing a very, very strong start on that front as well as that team now is taking up a bigger geography. And we now get to split the management bandwidth in the right way, so that we can give international, which is a huge investment area for us the right single threaded focus and do the same for our U.S business as well. Yes, all right. Well, Nikhil, maybe I'll take both of those. I think the first is on the -- how we think about investments. And the second is really around where we are on frequency and where it can go. On the first, let me just say, we kind of offered a quantitative framework in the shareholder letter on how we've thought about things. But it was meant as a guide, not as something that is just a formula that always can be applied, right? I mean, sometimes these things take judgment. And so, the answer to your question about our timelines or investment dollars is going to be larger or longer or shorter, or I guess less, it really depends on the problem at hand, right? I mean, obviously, we have a benefit of having the largest local commerce audience that has the greatest frequency, which gives us the most shots on goal. But that doesn't mean that we just win de facto. I mean, we have to still build the best-in-class product for each problem that we're trying to solve. And then I think the benefit of the scale will actually really translate in a way that makes productive sense for all of the audiences and frankly, generate a great return for everybody. And so I don't think there's necessarily one way to think about this. We try our best to play first principles approach to each problem. We obviously want to take advantage where we can, but the way we tend to think about this is, first and foremost, how do we solve a problem that in a way that is significantly better than how incumbents are doing it today, make sure that we are very disciplined in both the product investment as well as the dollar investment in which we stage gate that those investments because precious resources, whether it's the attention we can give in our distribution, or the dollars that we have in our budgets, or frankly, the people that we have working at the company, that's a big consideration. And then the final consideration is whether or not we see an efficient path towards strong long-term economics. And so that's just in general how we think about it, but I wouldn't over rotate necessarily on that being the exact formula that we have to repeat over and again. The second question I think has to do with frequency and its long-term potential. The short answer is we continue to see the numbers grow, right. And I think on the one hand, we -- there's a few ways to look at this. I think, in your question, I think you're kind of saying, well, there's 20 to 25 eating opportunities, be it shopping opportunities on top of that, but we are talking about north of 100 occasions a month. That's certainly I think theoretically, max. And I think that's one way to look at it. We also can look at it from just some of our power users or top decile users are actually doing today. So it's not even a theoretical number. And we think that we can keep growing much, much bigger, I guess, is the short answer. I mean, our top decile users are using our service, a very large number of double-digit times, I guess, is what I would say. And so for us, it's thinking about, well, how do we actually graduate people to that. And the answer is there isn't a silver bullet here, right. It's the combination of the selection of stores, the affordability of the program, the quality of the service, and making sure that we get the efficient -- we can deliver the efficient frontier for each individual user, each individual occasion. And if we can do that these numbers will continue moving up. Yes. So on the first question, in terms of where the growth is coming from, I mean, we are seeing mainly in two big areas, right? One is users and the other is the frequency. And you're right, in that, there is no one individual driver of this. I mean DashPass did have a record quarter. So it continues to achieve on highs. So you're right, as one of the assumptions that, that was one of the drivers. But we're also just seeing stronger and stronger cohorts. I think that this is a question at the -- certainly at the beginning of the pandemic, and certainly at the beginning of the reopening or the first reopening in 2021. But I think what you've seen now for 8 to 10 straight quarters in addition to the output metrics, GOV, the revenue, the input metrics we're seeing are stronger and stronger cohort retention and growth. And that's a combination of offering the best selection, quality, affordability. The new use cases, to your point, around non-restaurants certainly adds to it. But there's also improvements in the core restaurants business as well. So I think all of these things is adding to it. But the short answer to your question, what's driving the growth, it's users and frequency. Yes. Maybe I'll take a shot at the first one and maybe say a few things on the second one, too, and then I'll -- and ask Ravi to jump in on the second one as well. I think on the first one, I mean, you're right in the saying that there is no like exact formula of what are the exact adjacent problems to solve when it comes to unlocking local commerce, right? I mean I think if you think about today, even e-commerce is still a minority of overall retail. And then when you look within local commerce, so the small, medium and large physical businesses offline that are trying to come online and kind of compete against maybe digital only or kind of traditional e-commerce players, I mean, they're even further behind, right? And so our mission has always been to grow and to empower these businesses. So we have to, on the one hand, build a marketplace that can drive incremental demand at profitable sales. And on the other hand, we have to give them tools. And so some of these tools are related. But at the end of the day, it's just what does it take to solve the customers' problems. And we think that local businesses can solve a lot of the problems when it comes to consumption that traditional e-commerce businesses solve. And so we have to just make sure that we can build the tooling to allow them to do that, both through their own channel as well as through ours. I think on the second question, I think one of the important things here is we certainly -- there's kind of like two thoughts I have on your question. The first is, we don't get to control when product market fit occurs, right? And so a lot of the -- even though we would love to have prescribed organizational time lines set around every project with a perfect formula that's exactly replicable across all projects, that's not exactly what the customer cares about. The customer is going to vote with their activity, whether or not we've done a good enough job. And so for us, sometimes these things are you move one step forward, a couple of step sideways, one step backwards, three steps forward. And I think that while what we demonstrated in our restaurants business as well as these investment areas is that when you step back and take a look holistically over a multiyear horizon, you get this nice looking up into the right graph, that's not usually what happens in real life, right? So I think it's pretty hard sometimes when you're just making investments during the period, especially as you're searching for product market fit to have any prescribed time lines. But on the flip side, it doesn't mean that you have to bet at all in that period of time either, right? I think a lot of what we are trying to explain in our shareholder letter is just our investment philosophy that we are not just betting at all costs. We are betting when we see signal. And when we see that signal, do we actually scale? This is true in our product development. We didn't release the grocery -- we didn't release maximum exposure to our grocery product until very recently after 2.5 years, we didn't do that for our retail categories either. And we don't do that from a dollars and cents perspective on the P&L either. So I think when it comes to time line, I think judgment is quite important. And I think the most important thing to take away from the shareholder letter is that with a disciplined way in thinking about how to make these investments. Yes. Maybe I can take a shot at those. I think on the first question of growing the U.S. restaurants business. Well, I wish it was just one lever that we'd have to pull. But I mean, we continuously have to work on selection, the quality of the service, the affordability of the programs and our customer support, right? I mean this is one of these businesses where I think it's really easy to make surface level comments about the business, but really the execution happens at the order level. And you have to be better on each one. And for us, I think the criteria to be better, it really goes back to the hallmarks of how we have achieved the scale that we have in the restaurants business in the first place, which is offering the best combination of selection, quality, affordability and service. And so there's certainly a lot of things that we have in the books planned for each one of these areas, but that's really how we always think about building a better product. And we can measure whether or not we're making progress based on our retention and order frequency. And we continue to have the highest retention in order frequency rates amongst any other platform. The second question, I mean, in some ways, some of this is already happening, where we have, to your point, customers may be finding out about DoorDash for the first time through a non-restaurant category whether that's groceries or pets or flowers or some of the retail categories that we discussed earlier. Already outside of the restaurant category, we had tracked more of new customers that are ordering from these non-restaurants for the first time in the industry than any other platform. And I think that's pretty remarkable, given that a lot of these categories for us when we started about 2.5 years ago, which suggests that some of this activity is actually already happening organically. Of course, we are investing in some marketing behind this for sure, and especially as I think we are making the evolution of -- from being a restaurant delivery product to something that delivers your entire city. We're not there yet. Obviously, we have a long ways to go on the selection, the quality and affordability. But I think it's encouraging to see that we already attract more new customers into this field than anyone else and that a lot of customers are coming to us for the first time, not for restaurants. Yes. So Eric, I'll take that. I think it's important to start with the context of why we even are investing in some of our 1P efforts in the first place, which really comes back to this capability point of making sure that we can enable every small, medium and large physical business to compete effectively and efficiently in the digital world. And at the end of the day, what we are trying to build ultimately is a product that can deliver you everything from your city exactly what you ordered and at around the same price that you would have paid yourself to do that service. But today, that's not where status quo is, right, in terms of, I think, any product, that delivers anything outside of restaurants for sure. And so that's kind of why we invested in DashMarts in the first place. And so it's always in concert of -- with in partnership, excuse me, with our merchant partners of how to make sure that something like DashMart can be a useful service for them. It's not necessarily a signal of, oh, is our 1P now going to take a bigger portion. It's actually instead learning how to do it really well, such that when we work with these third parties and think about inventing some products for the future that this could be one capability set in our back pocket. Yes. So there's -- I mean customer expectations always going in one direction, right? I think except there is plenty of times, and I think that goes for subscription programs, too. But the other thing that goes for subscription programs is the most important thing is usage, right? You want to subscription programs that are really successful are those that get used the most often, which is what drives the value, right? And sometimes that's measured in dollars and cents, that sometimes that's measured in time spent on the service and over time saved from a service and et cetera, right? And so for us, I don't think it's necessarily one advantage, right? I wish if it were just one advantage, then it actually be quite easy to invest from a product perspective. But it's always been thinking about the selection, the quality, the affordability of the program such that we can drive the north star of usage. And so we are going to always have to invest to make sure that our products are getting us the most. I think the benefit for us is that the category that we started in eating, which we've talked about on this call for a bit, is the largest and most frequent, which means that it does have the largest usage from both I think how people think about spending their discretionary income to just what they do physically to survive. And so I think that was a very natural candidly reason why we started in the restaurant delivery category. But as we expand and try to be more useful to the cities that we operate in and all of the different types of categories of retail that we participate with, we are going to have to keep thinking about investing more into things that will continue to drive the usage of our subscription program, which is ultimately what will drive the value of DashPass. Yes. So on the first question, I think there's basically like a time line or sequencing, if you will, almost of how to arrive at the answer to your question, which is, first, when it comes to building a product from the very beginning, the -- what allows that product to grow faster relative to someone else's is whether or not we solve the customer's problems better, right? And I think what's hard to see in this business is that it's really a combination of things that a customer is asking us to solve. They're asking us to make sure we can get the right stores and the right items from those stores at the right price point, at the right service level. And obviously, if things go south, that we fix it. And there is no shortcut in many ways and kind of betting on any one of these factors, you kind of have to be better at the combination. And I think that if you can achieve that, then you can have this time line where after a certain point of scale, it translates into a few structural benefits. One of those benefits is recall customers kind of come to us first at the eating app. We are working on that to make that true in every country. But in the United States, that's certainly the starting point. And again, when eating is the starting place where you have the most shots on goal, and Ravi talked about the multiples of the 30 million monthly active shoppers who shop with us once a year. I mean there's an even bigger number than that that comes and just open who doesn't shop at all. And so in many ways, we don't have to acquire any more new customers from external channels. We can just go within our own ecosystem because we started with the largest one, which -- when it comes to consumption, which is eating. Other benefits come from the scale logistics components that you talked about, right, knowing how to operate that really efficiently is something that continues to compound in terms of giving a natural funding source for other types of investments that we want to make. So I think the way I think about this is always the execution starts first, making sure that we can solve a problem better than someone else can so that we can create the best product. That's what generates the growth. And then structurally, over time, what are the things that actually -- can we actually use the product advantage that we built to generate a structural advantage? And I think you're seeing that in both instances, which is why you've seen the resilience the growth in the core restaurant business. It's why you've seen faster growth and share gains in these non-restaurant businesses as well as improving -- or very, very quickly improving unit economics. And that's why we're continuing to invest."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Andy Hargreaves. Please go ahead.\nAndy Hargreaves: Thanks, Jean Louis. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Ravi Inukonda. We will be making forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call being our expectations for our business, financial position, operating performance, market, guidance, strategies, our investment approach, alignment with merchants and Dashers, and the consumer spending environment. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. Many of these uncertainties are described in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found in our letters to shareholders, which is available on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Finally, this call is being audio webcasted on our IR website. A replay of the call will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. Jean Louis, I will pass it back to you and we can take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of [Technical Difficulty]. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Thanks for all the color. I guess I had two questions. The cohort data for new verticals looks great. Just a clarification, so that shows subsequent purchase frequency, just in grocery and convenience and these folks are also purchasing for restaurant as well, is that correct? And are we at a point where we can maybe put a flag in the ground and talk about how much GOV or how many users are in things like grocery and convenience? And then the second question is, some of your peers have talked about linearity in the quarter getting a little stronger exiting the quarter compared to January because of pandemic effects? Is that also what you guys saw, just trying to reconcile that with the 2Q GOV guide? Thanks a lot.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Ross, I will -- it\u2019s Tony. I will start with the first question and then I will let Ravi chime in on the second question. So I think your first question really was around the performance and the strength of the cohorts in our new categories. I mean, the answer to your question is, yes. I mean the retained -- the new cohorts are certainly stronger than previous cohorts, a lot of this has to do with improvements in product quality. So adding selection players like ALDI, we now are -- we now serve 20-plus of the top grocers in the U.S. Number two, we are also improving the quality of the experience itself, making sure that we are more accurate both in the filling of the carts, the ability to perfect the substitution experience when the items that we shop for are not inside the store. And we are also doing this with greater convenience by allowing you more choices of whether you want this delivered in 30 minutes, whether you want it delivered a bit later in the day. And so, for all of those reasons, that\u2019s why you are seeing the cohort performance improve in new categories.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Ross. On the second question, consumer engagement and spending on the platform continues to be very strong. You can see that in our strong Q1 results, as well as the double-digit growth rate that we have driven consistently for the last two years in a row. I am not going to comment on the month-to-month, but it continues -- order frequency continues to be very good. In fact, it\u2019s an all-time high. Retention continues to be very strong in the business, retention this past quarter is higher than the prior quarter. We feel very confident about the input metrics we are seeing and I feel very good about the guidance for Q2.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDeepak Mathivanan: All right. Thanks for taking the question. Tony, I wanted to ask about your efforts on groceries verticals. It\u2019s still in early stages for you, but do you feel like you have the operating model sort of nailed down at this point, and perhaps, maybe talk about strategically what are the next steps in kind of scaling this huge opportunity? And then second one maybe for Ravi, it was nice to see the outperformance on EBITDA, but Prabir has always talked about profitability being the output metric based on the level of investments that you could make. Were there any sort of like strategic changes in your approach to investment areas in 1Q or for thinking for 2023? Maybe touch on areas where you are seeing nice returns on investment areas currently as well? Thanks so much.\nTony Xu: Yeah. I will start with the first question, which really was around grocery and the performance there. I mean, you are exactly right. I think both in terms of the numbers that we saw as a business collectively at the top and the bottomline, I mean, you are seeing continued growth, certainly, in the core restaurants business, even faster growth in businesses like grocery and you are seeing improvements in the unit economics of all of our business lines, altogether, including things happening overseas as well, and so I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s reflected in the performance of the quarter. And specifically on grocery, while I think that we have made, I mean, tremendous strides, we continue to grow faster than others and continue to gain share. I think there\u2019s still the long ways to go from the perspective of building the product. I mean, if you look compared grocery penetration in terms of online delivery in the U.S. relative to, say, online delivery of restaurant food, I mean, it\u2019s substantially lower by multiples. And I think that\u2019s because the off-line experience is still superior to the online experience, which means we have a long way to go to making sure that we can make the quality of the experience perfect, meaning you get exactly what you order that you can get it from all the places that you want to delivery from and that the prices are affordable or what you expect to pay in store. And I think there\u2019s a long way to go between where we are today and where we will be in the future, but I am very, very proud of the progress that the team has made.\nRavi Inukonda: And Deepak to your second question, nothing has changed in terms of how we think about our investment philosophy. What you are seeing in Q1 is a combination of a few factors. Obviously, as you commented, we had GOV upside in the business, which drove some of the EBITDA upside in the business. When I look at the various lines of business, our core restaurant business is growing even at its scale is continuing to grow quite nicely, strong and stable growth for the last several quarters in a row. The profitability of that line of business is continuing to improve. Our investment areas, both new verticals and international had a very strong first quarter. Growth has been strong, we continue to gain share in both areas, as well as margins have improved both sequentially, as well as annually. Now if you combine that with the discipline we have had on our operating expenses where OpEx was flat for the last three quarters in a row, that\u2019s giving rise to some of the EBITDA upside that you are seeing in the business. That said, we are constantly looking to reinvest back in the business, but there\u2019s going to be times when there\u2019s not going to be any efficient investment and it\u2019s okay for us to have that drop to the bottomline. In general, our philosophy is to continue to drive efficient growth, while being disciplined with our investments and one of the disciplined parameters that we use is the EBITDA guidance that we have given.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you. Maybe just a general question, how you guys are thinking about the opportunity for generative AI for DoorDash? I know AI has probably been integrated in the marketplace for quite some time, but any new opportunities that are being opened up? And then second, restaurant-specific partnerships like the recently announcement with Starbucks, how important are those for driving both GOV and contribution profit per order and just any way to frame the benefit there? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Sure. Bernie, maybe I can take both. It\u2019s Tony. On the first piece around generative AI, I mean, certainly, this is that\u2019s coming out movement, right? And I think it\u2019s super exciting, both as a technologist, as well as a user of the product. But also in terms of just seeing how fast developers are candidly making changes every day. And so, I think for us, it\u2019s important to remind ourselves our purpose, our purpose is really to build the defining local commerce company, which means that when you have two battles going on the battle for bits and digital attention in the battle for atoms, we very much are in the camp of the second category of making sure that we can win that battle. So very much the focus still remains to make sure that we are the highest quality last-mile logistics network and making sure that, that asset is the most useful and most attractive as we think about how it interfaces with digital assistance in the future. But that said, we are absolutely already running different experiments internally with some of the latest models that have been published when it comes to generative AI. I mean I think it has great promise for achieving productivity gains and doing especially a lot of the manual work that we have to do when we try to digitize the physical world and build the catalog for every city. I think it has a lot of promise for making the consumer experience, shopping experience, a lot easier as well by reducing friction. So I think you should expect a lot of fun things to come in the future and will be a big part of that. I think your second question really was around adding restaurant selection and especially with companies like Starbucks joining the platform. I mean, certainly, this has always been a big part of building our product, right? I mean for us, it\u2019s always about improving selection and adding to what customers want. It\u2019s about certainly increasing the quality of the delivery experience, improving the affordability of our service, as well as the customer support. And so selection has always been key to making sure that we can give customers what they want. Bringing on Starbucks is something that we are super excited to do and we look forward to even more partnerships.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael McGovern: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had two. First was about, I have noticed in the application a lot of types of advertising and promotion of the new service where you will pick up UPS and FedEx packages and deliver them for customers. So I was just wondering what the high level strategy is around that service, because it seems to be really differentiated from what your other services are, so a cool new feature? And then secondly, I noticed that there\u2019s a bit of a recent redesign in the layout of the interface on the application and I really like it, because it seems to -- it\u2019s much more seamless in reordering things that you have ordered in the past. So I was wondering if that was the focus with this recent redesign? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Sure. Hey, Michael. It\u2019s Tony. I will take both of those questions. So on the first around package pickup and delivery, Yeah, it\u2019s certainly something that we are very excited about. But I think at DoorDash, it\u2019s really important to, again, recognize what we are trying to do. What we are trying to do is to make sure that we can help any physical business grow and connect as many possible physical businesses with as many possible consumers. And it doesn\u2019t matter necessarily which direction in which travel is occurring, in terms of those connections. And so for us by having achieved, for instance, in the United States the greatest order density, we just have a lot more flexibility in terms of the choice of problems that we can solve for a lot of these customers and one of those problems that we heard about was this notion of solving returns in some of these package orders that you are dis -- you are kind of alluding to. And so it\u2019s really something that\u2019s very early stage, like, we run many new things at DoorDash all the time in the hope of solving increasingly higher customer expectations. This is one of them and we are excited about where things are right now, but there\u2019s a lot of these things happening always at DoorDash. On the second question on some of the improvements with respect to reordering. We are always trying to reduce friction when it comes to the ordering experience. Certainly, reorders are very popular amongst, in particular, our most engaged consumers. But there\u2019s a lot of things that we are trying to do to the app. We are trying to make it faster. We are trying to reduce the number of bugs. We are trying to make sure that you can find exactly what it is that you want that you can discover new things that might be enticing. So there\u2019s a lot of things that we are trying to do to always improve the experience and it\u2019s always with the mission of reducing friction.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morton of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morton: Thank you. I had a quick question on advertising. I was wondering if you could speak to the adoption rate you are seeing. It sounds to us like the SMBs are the early adopters. I would love to hear some details about the larger QSRs and their interest in the advertising platform? And then just a last question, if you would be interested, any additional details maybe around bookings growth in new verticals or just help us think about how that business is progressing? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yeah. I will start on the first question around ads and I will let Ravi take the second question. So with respect to advertising, I mean, you are right that, we are off to a pretty great start, and it\u2019s a fast clip, especially given the high standards that we are trying to put out for ourselves, which is -- on the one hand, we certainly have to meet the goals and create best-in-class return on ad spend for advertisers and merchants. And on the other hand, we also have to achieve the best possible consumer experience, where there is little to no degradation in terms of what consumers expect to see. And this is hard to do, because I think, it\u2019s really important to remember that with any marketplace business, and certainly, any desire to build an ad business, the most important thing is the engagement of the marketplace. And so this is something that I am really proud that our teams have balanced extraordinarily well, even though they have kept pace with, I think, the demands of what we see from advertisers, which is they want to run more ads and -- but we have to do that again in a very pro-consumer way and so we are seeing the demand on the advertising side from, candidly, every segment of merchants, whether -- and this goes for CPG companies in addition to the restaurants as well. So we are very excited that SMBs have found this to be a very capital efficient way to grow and effectively serve as their marketing department in some cases all the way to the largest brands in the world that you have heard of have the biggest budgets in the world that are finding a very, very large incremental use case when they work with the largest local commerce platform.\nRavi Inukonda: And Michael, just to add to what Tony talked about it, your specific question on the second one. Our ad business is growing, it\u2019s growing quite nicely, it\u2019s actually having an impact on our net revenue margin as well and our view for what that business is going to be is included in our EBITDA guidance for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nIan Peterson: Hi, guys. This is Ian Peterson on for Mark. It would be great if you could just provide us an update on DashPass and any engagement trends you can share there, both in the U.S. and also the subscription business in international as well with those? Thanks.\nRavi Inukonda: Ian, thanks for the question. DashPass came off of another great quarter, both in terms of sign-ups, as well as subscribers. For us the way we think about DashPass is, anything that you want in your city, you could get it for $10 a month, whether it\u2019s pet food, whether it\u2019s retail, whether it\u2019s grocery, whether it\u2019s convenience and that\u2019s a very compelling value proposition for us. And what we are seeing is, as we are continuing to drive the overall product quality up, as we are making the product more affordable, as we are driving the selection up, that\u2019s driving to more and more consumers graduate to DashPass and that\u2019s driving the strength in the business, both domestically, as well as internationally. We are very comfortable with the progress we have made and Q1 was a very strong quarter for DashPass for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Boone: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Europe. It feels like you guys took share in international. Can you talk about what you are seeing competitively and what\u2019s leading to greater traction? And then, Ravi, I wanted to follow up on an earlier answer that you gave about contribution margin improving. It sounds like you are now willing to drop more to the bottomline. Can you just talk about the piece of investments as it relates to new verticals? Is it just that the new verticals maturing or are you guys slowing down on any initial growth initiatives that may be more loss making? Thanks so much.\nTony Xu: Yeah. I will start on the first question, which was around Europe and the competitive position. I think, this is a great place to remind ourselves of a lot of the investment thesis we had behind teaming up with Wolt, who runs the majority of the markets outside of the U.S. for DoorDash. And really, the first thesis was that when you have the highest retention and frequency of engagement that, that is what will really allow the most capital efficient growth, especially in a category that has very, very long runways left. And that\u2019s really what we have seen in terms of the execution of the Wolt business. I mean even against difficult comps with Omicron of Q1 of last year, you see Wolt growing tremendously quickly year-on-year and certainly outpacing the rest of the class. And so I think that a lot of that, again, happens to do with the strength of the engagement of the consumer that Wolt has been able to build and it\u2019s a reflection of the product quality and so especially as Wolt now introduces some of their newer products with Wolt+, which is its DashPass equivalent, as well as some other products that it\u2019s borrowed from learning from the DoorDash U.S., I think, we are only going to see more growth in years to come.\nRavi Inukonda: And Andrew, to your second question, when I think about the contribution margin improving, I think of it in terms of two dimensions. One is the core restaurant business that\u2019s growing, it\u2019s growing quite nicely, as well as improving in terms of profitability. And when I look at the investment areas, when I think about the capital allocation, I look at it across two vectors. One is do -- does the product and investment have strong product market fit in terms of consumer demand, as well as the second one is, are they progressing in terms of unit economics? What you are seeing in Q1 ism both new verticals as well as international. They are growing quite nicely. They are gaining share in both of the areas, as well as the margins are improving both sequentially as well as annually. Now if you combine that with the fact, especially on the new vertical side, we have a structural advantage where we have a network of consumers and Dashers already built out, that\u2019s giving rise to some of the efficiency gains that you are seeing in the business, which is naturally translating into margin improvement. When you put both of those businesses together, you have these businesses that are growing, they are growing nicely, the margins are improving, as well as the core underlying fundamentals are improving. It has all the similarities of what we saw in the restaurant business very early on and we have strong conviction that if we continue to execute well, these two areas are going to be drivers of strong free cash flow generation for us.\nTony Xu: And put a different way, we are not slowing down any investments. It\u2019s -- the businesses are just growing top and bottomline, and that\u2019s what you are seeing in terms of the flow through towards the results.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, I wanted to ask about how you think about the runway for new user growth in the U.S. and sort of what type of user growth are you thinking about in the full year guide to grow new people to come to the platform in the U.S. and how do you do that at this point, kind of where we are on penetration? Then the second one on Wolt. You had the asset now for quite a while. It\u2019s been executing at a pretty high clip. Tony, what have been one or two of the biggest surprises to you about Wolt that maybe you didn\u2019t even appreciate when you acquired the asset?\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Brian. Yeah. I will take both questions. On the first question about user adoption, I think, sometimes, it\u2019s just important to remember that, it\u2019s no different in acquiring users versus getting users who may have tried the product to use the product more often, which is we just have to improve the product. And so whether that means we didn\u2019t have the right selection to attract a customer in that moment or that occasion, the right pricing, the right speed and/or quality of delivery or we messed up on customer support. I mean those are the building blocks of how we win any customer and I think the fact that people eat 20 times to 25 times a week is really, frankly, why I think there\u2019s such a large runway left for growth. It\u2019s not necessarily about can you serve all of the users and where are we on that journey? That\u2019s one part of it, but then you have to multiply that by 20 times per week to 25 times per week and that potential. And so that\u2019s at least how it works in my brain and to me, it\u2019s the same of whether we want to go attract a new user or just win a new use case or in an incremental use case of the 20 times to 25 times occasions per week that a customer is eating and we know that, that happens all the time. So that\u2019s the first question. On Wolt, which I believe is your second question, I mean, I would say a few things that I have come to appreciate even further. I think first is really the -- their ability to compete in a very capital efficient way has been, I think, just really, really interesting and unique. I mean I think sometimes, especially now as DoorDash is generating more and more positive free cash flow, it\u2019s almost easy to forget when some of the constraints were even tighter and the budgets were a lot smaller and I think it\u2019s been really impressive to watch what gold can do, I think, in that regard. And that\u2019s really a testament to the team the ability to always focus on the product to make sure that we can keep increasing the retention and the frequency of the experience such that, that\u2019s how we will actually outcompete both and make good investments, not just this year, but for years to come. I think the second is more a comment around maybe the market, which is in a lot of these European markets, I think, we maybe sometimes, because we live in the U.S. or maybe we live in other countries where e-commerce has been a bit more at the forefront or just has had longer to adopt for users that. A lot of these countries are just kind of having a lot of the physical stores come online for the first time and that\u2019s true certainly for restaurants, but also outside of restaurants and I think a lot of the fast growth that you are seeing Wolt is their ability to serve all of the categories and very much the same goals that DoorDash has to become the local commerce -- company Wolt wants to do the same thing in all of its geographies and so I think that shared mission is really what allows us to work really well together.\nRavi Inukonda: And Brian, just to the specific question on the guidance point itself, we do expect to grow both users, as well as order frequency and that\u2019s baked into our guidance that we have given.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you. I have two questions as well. So just on the guidance, Ravi. So, again, if I look at the GOV -- the total market GOV, it looks like, at the midpoint, the growth is in the low 20, if I look at the last nine months, the last three quarters, it was really more like 29% or 30%. Is there anything related to maybe Wolt annualizing now that\u2019s kind of causing that number to decline so that -- is that just out of kind of lack of visibility potentially considering the macro, et cetera? Anything there could be -- would be really helpful? And then I guess as you look at the free cash flow, so certainly your execution has been pretty impressive. How should we be thinking about timing to hit positive free cash flow for the non-restaurant business on the back of just the stronger topline. Has that timing kind of shortened? Thank you.\nRavi Inukonda: Yeah. Youssef, let me start with the first one. On the GOV itself, a couple of points here. I mentioned earlier that, consumer engagement continues to be strong. When I look at both retention, as well as order frequency, I feel very optimistic about the signals that we are seeing in the business. That\u2019s what\u2019s giving us confidence to bump up the GOV guide for the rest of the year. To your specific point on the growth rate comp itself, we do lap the Wolt acquisition in June, so you are seeing an impact of that in the second half of the year. In terms of your second question on free cash flow, in terms of when I look at the new verticals business in Q1, it had a very strong first quarter, both in terms of growth, as well as improvements in margin. And underlying what you are seeing in the business is, as we continue to improve the quality, as we are continuing to make the product more affordable, that\u2019s driving not just topline growth, but also we are seeing efficiency in the business and that efficiency is contributing to the improvement in margin. On the absolute dollar basis, we are not going to comment on it, but I feel good about the investment levels and that\u2019s included in our EBITDA guidance for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two. Tony, in the letter, you talked about double-digit improvements in grocery quality and efficiency metrics. Can you just help us understand what these improvements were to drive the improvements in overall quality and efficiency, any insights would be helpful? And then, Ravi, just a quick clarification on contribution margins, last year, I think we saw convenience as a vertical become variable contribution positive. And so I am wondering if other newer verticals are contributing here, given the structural advantage that you talked about or do you expect perhaps grocery or alcohol or others to start delivering at least variable contribution margins by the end of this year? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Ron. On the first question around the improvement in the product quality and grocery. A big part of this stems from the fact that today physical stores, grocery stores, that is, don\u2019t always know exactly what\u2019s on their shelves. And that\u2019s quite a hard problem to solve for a variety of reasons, we can literally go on for hours to talk about all of the different reasons. But that\u2019s the problem that we have gotten better at in terms of making sure that we can get you exactly what you ordered. I am not saying we are perfect, and I mentioned, I think, to an earlier question that we are still the long ways to go in terms of where I want to see this product experience. But I think with tremendous strides in the two years that we have been doing this and I think as a result of that, you are seeing increases in the cohort engagement that we talked about in the letter and that\u2019s showing, therefore, both basically a capital efficient way to grow. Because to me, the most -- the best way to achieve capital efficiency is through improvements in product quality and I think that, that was a very nice one-to-one correlation that we saw and that really stemmed from many quarters of work that showed up in some of the results in this quarter.\nRavi Inukonda: And Ron, to your second point, right, like, just to add on to what Tony said, some of the quality improvements that we are driving in the business is also resulting in the efficiency gains. Our third-party convenience that you talked about is variable profit positive and it\u2019s continuing to improve. All categories within our new verticals umbrella, whether it\u2019s grocery, our DashMart business, our third-party convenience are improving. We feel good about the progress and we talked about in the letter, overall on a margin basis, our new verticals is improving both sequentially, as well as annually.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rohit Kulkarni of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nRohit Kulkarni: Okay. Thanks for taking my question. One on AI, I know generative AI is on top of every investor\u2019s mind. But I guess just internally speaking, maybe talk about longer term, how are you thinking about using AI to improve productivity of engineers, marketing salespeople. And in structurally, do you feel kind of DoorDash and all Silicon Valley companies are going to be much more profitable as they start to figure out applying AI to all the internal processes, maybe they become the first wave of adopters of these productivity tools? And then second question is on just new vertical margins, it\u2019s been a couple of years since you have had these deem verticals and it feels that they are starting to pull ahead the overall margin profile. So maybe just structurally, can you talk about the various puts and takes between the core restaurant most profitable business versus all the new verticals as you start kind of layering on the incremental profits from them. How we should think about the overall profitability steady state as such?\nTony Xu: Yeah. I will take the first question and maybe Ravi can take the second. With respect to AI and its ability to change the trajectory of some of these functions that you asked about in the question. Look, I mean, I think, it certainly represents the promise for a lot of productivity gains. In terms of how those productivity gains will be expressed in terms of financial results for a company, I think that\u2019s very hard to estimate, because on the one hand, you are going to have the same number of people who can hopefully do more with what they have with now more advanced tooling. But then on the other hand, you have to not forget the customer, the customer\u2019s expectations are always going to go higher and higher and higher. Take coding, for instance, the number of engineers almost never seems to be enough in terms of what the demand for engineering talent is, as well as just frankly, like the number of things to build. And so I think that you are going to have kind of two forces competing for this, one is the productivity gains, which I certainly would expect to see, but then on the other hand, I also believe that customer expectations always go in one direction, which is higher and higher and higher and so I think the balance of the two will be -- what all of us will be going through.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Rohit. On your second question on margins. The way it is I think about it is. Our core restaurant business is growing, as well as improving in terms of overall profitability. But we still are a small portion of the overall sales for the restaurant industry. So we continue to invest behind that business. It\u2019s important that we continue to invest behind quality, invest behind making the product more affordable, because that\u2019s going to drive long-term growth in that business. Secondly, on new verticals, what we are seeing is, some of the quality improvements that Tony touched on earlier in the previous question, that\u2019s driving efficiency in the business. That business as a whole is improving in terms of margin, both sequentially, as well as annually. But the market there is very large, we are still underpenetrated and I think if we continue to improve the overall product, that\u2019s going to drive long-term free cash flow generation for us. It\u2019s a business that we are going to continue to invest in and continue to improve the product experience for our consumers, merchants, as well as Dashers.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two quick ones, if I can squeeze in. First, when you look out over the landscape in 2023 and beyond, what do you continue to see as some of the key investments you need to make on the merchant side of your plate -- of your platform that will continue to drive more merchant growth, more merchant adoption and where you can gain deeper relationships and market share of the merchant side? That would be number one. And then number two, when you look further out, how should we be thinking about you making the app more shoppable for lack of a better term. We talked on the last call about increasing velocity and order volume among your user base, and I am just curious, given all the direct traffic you have to app, how do you think about overlaying all the SKU diversification you have built on possibly driving greater levels of frequency and app across all those SKUs? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Eric. I will take both of those questions. On the first question with respect to merchants, I mean, basically, the short answer is that we are going to have to solve more and more of their problems in order to work more and more deeply with them with the goal of helping them improve same-store sales and profitability. And sometimes these things take swings, right? I mean, take for example, if we can span out a little bit in the years of 2021 and 2022, particularly when consumers were roaring back inside stores. There was a big focus for merchants to make sure that they can staff up to meet that in-store demand and they needed to take maybe the guest pedal off of digital for a bit. You are starting to see some of this now swing back, for instance, as these merchants are lapping those years of in-store growth and they are now returning back into investing into their digital channels. So I think you are going to see these kinds of ebbs and flows. But I think all of this is really in the name of how do we build enough tools and products for merchants to better understand their customers, better engaged with those customers, the long-term relationships with those customers, do it through the first-party channel and whether that\u2019s being powered with products like DoorDash Drive and Storefront or the third-party DoorDash Platform and the Marketplace. And so I think there\u2019s a lot there that we are going to have to continue to do to just solve more and more problems, because just like consumer expectations, for merchant expectations grow, too. And I think they are always going to be on this -- when you are a business owner, particularly, if you are like my mom or a single-store owner, you are going to have 50 things you are thinking, but at the end of the day, you are always thinking between growth and profitability and dynamic. Your second question is, I think, how do you make the app more shoppable and this is a phenomenal question. I mean I think it\u2019s going to be -- it\u2019s certainly the endeavor that we are marching on, where we are becoming more and more of a multi-category destination. I mean you see this certainly in the numbers and you see this, I think, even in the fact that we are now acquiring more new customers into the grocery and convenience sectors more than anyone else and for the first time. And so I think that is telling us that customers expect DoorDash to be able to deliver upon those experiences, whether they are coming in and trying to buy a baseball bat from DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods or trying to buy a pound of lettuce from a grocery store. And so we are doing lots of things right now. We are improving the catalog. We are making sure that there\u2019s improvements to search. We are making sure that we can create an item-based shopping experience. There\u2019s lots of things that we have to do in order to catalog digitally, the physical world and then present that catalog in concert with our merchants, so that it makes sense to the consumers and that they can achieve the merchant goals too. I mean this is the delicate and very important responsibility that we have to make sure that DoorDash can work for everyone. And if it can work for everyone, then we believe the results will be something that we are proud of.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of UBS. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two questions on just some of the numbers, if I can. First, just if we look at sales and marketing, it looks like growth there stepped up a bit from 4Q to 1Q. I am wondering if that\u2019s kind of a new newish normal. And then, similarly, we saw a nice step-up in gross profit margins, so wondering if that -- if we should be thinking about that as a new level or just continuing to expand that? Thanks.\nRavi Inukonda: Yeah. Hey, Lloyd. I will take the gross margin one first. On the last call, I mentioned that 2023 gross margin was going to be higher than Q4 levels. That\u2019s exactly what you are seeing in the business. A few factors at play here, over the last year and a half, we have driven a number of improvements on the product side, which has made our logistics engine more efficient and you are seeing that leverage come through in terms of Dasher cost per order. Quality has been a key priority for us and what we have noted is that we continue to work on quality that\u2019s driving retention higher. We are seeing the benefit in terms of growth, as well as lower credits and refunds costs. That, combined with our ads business, which I mentioned earlier, that\u2019s growing -- that\u2019s also having an impact on our margin. That said, we don\u2019t operate or run the business to a specific margin target. Our goal is to invest flexibly across the P&L in order to be able to drive efficient growth. To your second question on sales and marketing, Q1 was a strong quarter in terms of topline volume for us, and in order to support that volume, we had to acquire more Dashers. That\u2019s the result of your Dasher acquisition cost going up, which is driving sales and marketing higher. That said, I would not read too much into the volatility. If you take a look at over the course of the last year, we are doing a ton of leverage on sales and marketing, all from product improvements that we have made. I do expect there to be more leverage on the sales and marketing side and that view is included in our EBITDA guidance that we have given.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of John Colantuoni of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Curious to dig a little bit into DashPass member adoption of new verticals like grocery, retail and convenience, and how that compares to non-members? And related to that, we know DashPass members order more once they become members and more -- order more than non-members. But I am curious to hear if you are able to provide any color on how these upticks and frequency vary across verticals. Do grocery or retail orders increase even more than restaurant orders after user becomes a member? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Hey, John. It\u2019s Tony. I will try to answer your questions. I don\u2019t think we run the business that way in the sense that we are trying to necessarily steer a customer into one category or the other. Instead, what we are trying to do is we are trying to build the best-in-class experience within each category and then allow the customer to choose which one of those experiences make the most sense for them for that particular shopping occasion.  And then DashPass, to your point, is something that we can stitch across to provide the greatest possible value, because we are going to give you everything inside your city within that DashPass membership. So I don\u2019t think that we are trying to necessarily steer people one way or the other. I think it\u2019s probably intuitive that prepared meal, something like restaurant food is going to have the highest frequency. But that makes sense, because we 20 times to 25 times a week, which is the highest possible shopping category that we have relative to other categories. But that said, I mentioned earlier or to an earlier question that we now are attracting more new customers into the industry outside of restaurant foods than anyone else. And so people are now coming to DoorDash for the first time, not shopping from restaurant food, but also shopping for their grocery items, their liquor needs, their retail items et cetera and et cetera. So I think this is just one of those things where as long as we continue to build the best possible shopping experience within each category and then stitched across the categories and then overlay that with the value of DashPass, we will be in a good position.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ravi Inukonda",
            "content": "Hey, Ross. On the second question, consumer engagement and spending on the platform continues to be very strong. You can see that in our strong Q1 results, as well as the double-digit growth rate that we have driven consistently for the last two years in a row. I am not going to comment on the month-to-month, but it continues -- order frequency continues to be very good. In fact, it's an all-time high. Retention continues to be very strong in the business, retention this past quarter is higher than the prior quarter. We feel very confident about the input metrics we are seeing and I feel very good about the guidance for Q2. And Deepak to your second question, nothing has changed in terms of how we think about our investment philosophy. What you are seeing in Q1 is a combination of a few factors. Obviously, as you commented, we had GOV upside in the business, which drove some of the EBITDA upside in the business. When I look at the various lines of business, our core restaurant business is growing even at its scale is continuing to grow quite nicely, strong and stable growth for the last several quarters in a row. The profitability of that line of business is continuing to improve. Our investment areas, both new verticals and international had a very strong first quarter. Growth has been strong, we continue to gain share in both areas, as well as margins have improved both sequentially, as well as annually. Now if you combine that with the discipline we have had on our operating expenses where OpEx was flat for the last three quarters in a row, that's giving rise to some of the EBITDA upside that you are seeing in the business. That said, we are constantly looking to reinvest back in the business, but there's going to be times when there's not going to be any efficient investment and it's okay for us to have that drop to the bottomline. In general, our philosophy is to continue to drive efficient growth, while being disciplined with our investments and one of the disciplined parameters that we use is the EBITDA guidance that we have given. And Michael, just to add to what Tony talked about it, your specific question on the second one. Our ad business is growing, it's growing quite nicely, it's actually having an impact on our net revenue margin as well and our view for what that business is going to be is included in our EBITDA guidance for the rest of the year. Ian, thanks for the question. DashPass came off of another great quarter, both in terms of sign-ups, as well as subscribers. For us the way we think about DashPass is, anything that you want in your city, you could get it for $10 a month, whether it's pet food, whether it's retail, whether it's grocery, whether it's convenience and that's a very compelling value proposition for us. And what we are seeing is, as we are continuing to drive the overall product quality up, as we are making the product more affordable, as we are driving the selection up, that's driving to more and more consumers graduate to DashPass and that's driving the strength in the business, both domestically, as well as internationally. We are very comfortable with the progress we have made and Q1 was a very strong quarter for DashPass for us. And Andrew, to your second question, when I think about the contribution margin improving, I think of it in terms of two dimensions. One is the core restaurant business that's growing, it's growing quite nicely, as well as improving in terms of profitability. And when I look at the investment areas, when I think about the capital allocation, I look at it across two vectors. One is do -- does the product and investment have strong product market fit in terms of consumer demand, as well as the second one is, are they progressing in terms of unit economics? What you are seeing in Q1 ism both new verticals as well as international. They are growing quite nicely. They are gaining share in both of the areas, as well as the margins are improving both sequentially as well as annually. Now if you combine that with the fact, especially on the new vertical side, we have a structural advantage where we have a network of consumers and Dashers already built out, that's giving rise to some of the efficiency gains that you are seeing in the business, which is naturally translating into margin improvement. When you put both of those businesses together, you have these businesses that are growing, they are growing nicely, the margins are improving, as well as the core underlying fundamentals are improving. It has all the similarities of what we saw in the restaurant business very early on and we have strong conviction that if we continue to execute well, these two areas are going to be drivers of strong free cash flow generation for us. And Brian, just to the specific question on the guidance point itself, we do expect to grow both users, as well as order frequency and that's baked into our guidance that we have given. Yeah. Youssef, let me start with the first one. On the GOV itself, a couple of points here. I mentioned earlier that, consumer engagement continues to be strong. When I look at both retention, as well as order frequency, I feel very optimistic about the signals that we are seeing in the business. That's what's giving us confidence to bump up the GOV guide for the rest of the year. To your specific point on the growth rate comp itself, we do lap the Wolt acquisition in June, so you are seeing an impact of that in the second half of the year. In terms of your second question on free cash flow, in terms of when I look at the new verticals business in Q1, it had a very strong first quarter, both in terms of growth, as well as improvements in margin. And underlying what you are seeing in the business is, as we continue to improve the quality, as we are continuing to make the product more affordable, that's driving not just topline growth, but also we are seeing efficiency in the business and that efficiency is contributing to the improvement in margin. On the absolute dollar basis, we are not going to comment on it, but I feel good about the investment levels and that's included in our EBITDA guidance for the rest of the year. And Ron, to your second point, right, like, just to add on to what Tony said, some of the quality improvements that we are driving in the business is also resulting in the efficiency gains. Our third-party convenience that you talked about is variable profit positive and it's continuing to improve. All categories within our new verticals umbrella, whether it's grocery, our DashMart business, our third-party convenience are improving. We feel good about the progress and we talked about in the letter, overall on a margin basis, our new verticals is improving both sequentially, as well as annually. Hey, Rohit. On your second question on margins. The way it is I think about it is. Our core restaurant business is growing, as well as improving in terms of overall profitability. But we still are a small portion of the overall sales for the restaurant industry. So we continue to invest behind that business. It's important that we continue to invest behind quality, invest behind making the product more affordable, because that's going to drive long-term growth in that business. Secondly, on new verticals, what we are seeing is, some of the quality improvements that Tony touched on earlier in the previous question, that's driving efficiency in the business. That business as a whole is improving in terms of margin, both sequentially, as well as annually. But the market there is very large, we are still underpenetrated and I think if we continue to improve the overall product, that's going to drive long-term free cash flow generation for us. It's a business that we are going to continue to invest in and continue to improve the product experience for our consumers, merchants, as well as Dashers. Yeah. Hey, Lloyd. I will take the gross margin one first. On the last call, I mentioned that 2023 gross margin was going to be higher than Q4 levels. That's exactly what you are seeing in the business. A few factors at play here, over the last year and a half, we have driven a number of improvements on the product side, which has made our logistics engine more efficient and you are seeing that leverage come through in terms of Dasher cost per order.

        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Yeah. Hey, Ross, I will -- it's Tony. I will start with the first question and then I will let Ravi chime in on the second question. So I think your first question really was around the performance and the strength of the cohorts in our new categories. I mean, the answer to your question is, yes. I mean the retained -- the new cohorts are certainly stronger than previous cohorts, a lot of this has to do with improvements in product quality. So adding selection players like ALDI, we now are -- we now serve 20-plus of the top grocers in the U.S. Number two, we are also improving the quality of the experience itself, making sure that we are more accurate both in the filling of the carts, the ability to perfect the substitution experience when the items that we shop for are not inside the store. And we are also doing this with greater convenience by allowing you more choices of whether you want this delivered in 30 minutes, whether you want it delivered a bit later in the day. And so, for all of those reasons, that's why you are seeing the cohort performance improve in new categories. Yeah. I will start with the first question, which really was around grocery and the performance there. I mean, you are exactly right. I think both in terms of the numbers that we saw as a business collectively at the top and the bottomline, I mean, you are seeing continued growth, certainly, in the core restaurants business, even faster growth in businesses like grocery and you are seeing improvements in the unit economics of all of our business lines, altogether, including things happening overseas as well, and so I think that's really what's reflected in the performance of the quarter. And specifically on grocery, while I think that we have made, I mean, tremendous strides, we continue to grow faster than others and continue to gain share. I think there's still the long ways to go from the perspective of building the product. I mean, if you look compared grocery penetration in terms of online delivery in the U.S. relative to, say, online delivery of restaurant food, I mean, it's substantially lower by multiples. And I think that's because the off-line experience is still superior to the online experience, which means we have a long way to go to making sure that we can make the quality of the experience perfect, meaning you get exactly what you order that you can get it from all the places that you want to delivery from and that the prices are affordable or what you expect to pay in store. And I think there's a long way to go between where we are today and where we will be in the future, but I am very, very proud of the progress that the team has made. Sure. Bernie, maybe I can take both. It's Tony. On the first piece around generative AI, I mean, certainly, this is that's coming out movement, right? And I think it's super exciting, both as a technologist, as well as a user of the product. But also in terms of just seeing how fast developers are candidly making changes every day. And so, I think for us, it's important to remind ourselves our purpose, our purpose is really to build the defining local commerce company, which means that when you have two battles going on the battle for bits and digital attention in the battle for atoms, we very much are in the camp of the second category of making sure that we can win that battle. So very much the focus still remains to make sure that we are the highest quality last-mile logistics network and making sure that, that asset is the most useful and most attractive as we think about how it interfaces with digital assistance in the future. But that said, we are absolutely already running different experiments internally with some of the latest models that have been published when it comes to generative AI. I mean I think it has great promise for achieving productivity gains and doing especially a lot of the manual work that we have to do when we try to digitize the physical world and build the catalog for every city. I think it has a lot of promise for making the consumer experience, shopping experience, a lot easier as well by reducing friction. So I think you should expect a lot of fun things to come in the future and will be a big part of that. I think your second question really was around adding restaurant selection and especially with companies like Starbucks joining the platform. I mean, certainly, this has always been a big part of building our product, right? I mean for us, it's always about improving selection and adding to what customers want. It's about certainly increasing the quality of the delivery experience, improving the affordability of our service, as well as the customer support. And so selection has always been key to making sure that we can give customers what they want. Bringing on Starbucks is something that we are super excited to do and we look forward to even more partnerships. Sure. Hey, Michael. It's Tony. I will take both of those questions. So on the first around package pickup and delivery, Yeah, it's certainly something that we are very excited about. But I think at DoorDash, it's really important to, again, recognize what we are trying to do. What we are trying to do is to make sure that we can help any physical business grow and connect as many possible physical businesses with as many possible consumers. And it doesn't matter necessarily which direction in which travel is occurring, in terms of those connections. And so for us by having achieved, for instance, in the United States the greatest order density, we just have a lot more flexibility in terms of the choice of problems that we can solve for a lot of these customers and one of those problems that we heard about was this notion of solving returns in some of these package orders that you are dis -- you are kind of alluding to. And so it's really something that's very early stage, like, we run many new things at DoorDash all the time in the hope of solving increasingly higher customer expectations. This is one of them and we are excited about where things are right now, but there's a lot of these things happening always at DoorDash. On the second question on some of the improvements with respect to reordering. We are always trying to reduce friction when it comes to the ordering experience. Certainly, reorders are very popular amongst, in particular, our most engaged consumers. But there's a lot of things that we are trying to do to the app. We are trying to make it faster. We are trying to reduce the number of bugs. We are trying to make sure that you can find exactly what it is that you want that you can discover new things that might be enticing. So there's a lot of things that we are trying to do to always improve the experience and it's always with the mission of reducing friction. Yeah. I will start on the first question around ads and I will let Ravi take the second question. So with respect to advertising, I mean, you are right that, we are off to a pretty great start, and it's a fast clip, especially given the high standards that we are trying to put out for ourselves, which is -- on the one hand, we certainly have to meet the goals and create best-in-class return on ad spend for advertisers and merchants. And on the other hand, we also have to achieve the best possible consumer experience, where there is little to no degradation in terms of what consumers expect to see. And this is hard to do, because I think, it's really important to remember that with any marketplace business, and certainly, any desire to build an ad business, the most important thing is the engagement of the marketplace. And so this is something that I am really proud that our teams have balanced extraordinarily well, even though they have kept pace with, I think, the demands of what we see from advertisers, which is they want to run more ads and -- but we have to do that again in a very pro-consumer way and so we are seeing the demand on the advertising side from, candidly, every segment of merchants, whether -- and this goes for CPG companies in addition to the restaurants as well. So we are very excited that SMBs have found this to be a very capital efficient way to grow and effectively serve as their marketing department in some cases all the way to the largest brands in the world that you have heard of have the biggest budgets in the world that are finding a very, very large incremental use case when they work with the largest local commerce platform. Yeah. I will start on the first question, which was around Europe and the competitive position. I think, this is a great place to remind ourselves of a lot of the investment thesis we had behind teaming up with Wolt, who runs the majority of the markets outside of the U.S. for DoorDash. And really, the first thesis was that when you have the highest retention and frequency of engagement that, that is what will really allow the most capital efficient growth, especially in a category that has very, very long runways left. And that's really what we have seen in terms of the execution of the Wolt business. I mean even against difficult comps with Omicron of Q1 of last year, you see Wolt growing tremendously quickly year-on-year and certainly outpacing the rest of the class. And so I think that a lot of that, again, happens to do with the strength of the engagement of the consumer that Wolt has been able to build and it's a reflection of the product quality and so especially as Wolt now introduces some of their newer products with Wolt+, which is its DashPass equivalent, as well as some other products that it's borrowed from learning from the DoorDash U.S., I think, we are only going to see more growth in years to come. And put a different way, we are not slowing down any investments. It's -- the businesses are just growing top and bottomline, and that's what you are seeing in terms of the flow through towards the results. Yeah. Hey, Brian. Yeah. I will take both questions. On the first question about user adoption, I think, sometimes, it's just important to remember that, it's no different in acquiring users versus getting users who may have tried the product to use the product more often, which is we just have to improve the product. And so whether that means we didn't have the right selection to attract a customer in that moment or that occasion, the right pricing, the right speed and/or quality of delivery or we messed up on customer support. I mean those are the building blocks of how we win any customer and I think the fact that people eat 20 times to 25 times a week is really, frankly, why I think there's such a large runway left for growth. It's not necessarily about can you serve all of the users and where are we on that journey? That's one part of it, but then you have to multiply that by 20 times per week to 25 times per week and that potential. And so that's at least how it works in my brain and to me, it's the same of whether we want to go attract a new user or just win a new use case or in an incremental use case of the 20 times to 25 times occasions per week that a customer is eating and we know that, that happens all the time. So that's the first question. On Wolt, which I believe is your second question, I mean, I would say a few things that I have come to appreciate even further. I think first is really the -- their ability to compete in a very capital efficient way has been, I think, just really, really interesting and unique. I mean I think sometimes, especially now as DoorDash is generating more and more positive free cash flow, it's almost easy to forget when some of the constraints were even tighter and the budgets were a lot smaller and I think it's been really impressive to watch what gold can do, I think, in that regard. And that's really a testament to the team the ability to always focus on the product to make sure that we can keep increasing the retention and the frequency of the experience such that, that's how we will actually outcompete both and make good investments, not just this year, but for years to come. I think the second is more a comment around maybe the market, which is in a lot of these European markets, I think, we maybe sometimes, because we live in the U.S. or maybe we live in other countries where e-commerce has been a bit more at the forefront or just has had longer to adopt for users that. A lot of these countries are just kind of having a lot of the physical stores come online for the first time and that's true certainly for restaurants, but also outside of restaurants and I think a lot of the fast growth that you are seeing Wolt is their ability to serve all of the categories and very much the same goals that DoorDash has to become the local commerce -- company Wolt wants to do the same thing in all of its geographies and so I think that shared mission is really what allows us to work really well together. Yeah. Hey, Ron. On the first question around the improvement in the product quality and grocery. A big part of this stems from the fact that today physical stores, grocery stores, that is, don't always know exactly what's on their shelves. And that's quite a hard problem to solve for a variety of reasons, we can literally go on for hours to talk about all of the different reasons. But that's the problem that we have gotten better at in terms of making sure that we can get you exactly what you ordered. I am not saying we are perfect, and I mentioned, I think, to an earlier question that we are still the long ways to go in terms of where I want to see this product experience. But I think with tremendous strides in the two years that we have been doing this and I think as a result of that, you are seeing increases in the cohort engagement that we talked about in the letter and that's showing, therefore, both basically a capital efficient way to grow. Because to me, the most -- the best way to achieve capital efficiency is through improvements in product quality and I think that, that was a very nice one-to-one correlation that we saw and that really stemmed from many quarters of work that showed up in some of the results in this quarter. Yeah. I will take the first question and maybe Ravi can take the second. With respect to AI and its ability to change the trajectory of some of these functions that you asked about in the question. Look, I mean, I think, it certainly represents the promise for a lot of productivity gains. In terms of how those productivity gains will be expressed in terms of financial results for a company, I think that's very hard to estimate, because on the one hand, you are going to have the same number of people who can hopefully do more with what they have with now more advanced tooling. But then on the other hand, you have to not forget the customer, the customer's expectations are always going to go higher and higher and higher. Take coding, for instance, the number of engineers almost never seems to be enough in terms of what the demand for engineering talent is, as well as just frankly, like the number of things to build. And so I think that you are going to have kind of two forces competing for this, one is the productivity gains, which I certainly would expect to see, but then on the other hand, I also believe that customer expectations always go in one direction, which is higher and higher and higher and so I think the balance of the two will be -- what all of us will be going through. Yeah. Hey, Eric. I will take both of those questions. On the first question with respect to merchants, I mean, basically, the short answer is that we are going to have to solve more and more of their problems in order to work more and more deeply with them with the goal of helping them improve same-store sales and profitability. And sometimes these things take swings, right? I mean, take for example, if we can span out a little bit in the years of 2021 and 2022, particularly when consumers were roaring back inside stores. There was a big focus for merchants to make sure that they can staff up to meet that in-store demand and they needed to take maybe the guest pedal off of digital for a bit. You are starting to see some of this now swing back, for instance, as these merchants are lapping those years of in-store growth and they are now returning back into investing into their digital channels. So I think you are going to see these kinds of ebbs and flows. But I think all of this is really in the name of how do we build enough tools and products for merchants to better understand their customers, better engaged with those customers, the long-term relationships with those customers, do it through the first-party channel and whether that's being powered with products like DoorDash Drive and Storefront or the third-party DoorDash Platform and the Marketplace. And so I think there's a lot there that we are going to have to continue to do to just solve more and more problems, because just like consumer expectations, for merchant expectations grow, too. And I think they are always going to be on this -- when you are a business owner, particularly, if you are like my mom or a single-store owner, you are going to have 50 things you are thinking, but at the end of the day, you are always thinking between growth and profitability and dynamic. Your second question is, I think, how do you make the app more shoppable and this is a phenomenal question. I mean I think it's going to be -- it's certainly the endeavor that we are marching on, where we are becoming more and more of a multi-category destination. I mean you see this certainly in the numbers and you see this, I think, even in the fact that we are now acquiring more new customers into the grocery and convenience sectors more than anyone else and for the first time. And so I think that is telling us that customers expect DoorDash to be able to deliver upon those experiences, whether they are coming in and trying to buy a baseball bat from DICK'S Sporting Goods or trying to buy a pound of lettuce from a grocery store. And so we are doing lots of things right now. We are improving the catalog. We are making sure that there's improvements to search. We are making sure that we can create an item-based shopping experience. There's lots of things that we have to do in order to catalog digitally, the physical world and then present that catalog in concert with our merchants, so that it makes sense to the consumers and that they can achieve the merchant goals too. I mean this is the delicate and very important responsibility that we have to make sure that DoorDash can work for everyone. And if it can work for everyone, then we believe the results will be something that we are proud of. Hey, John. It's Tony. I will try to answer your questions. I don't think we run the business that way in the sense that we are trying to necessarily steer a customer into one category or the other. Instead, what we are trying to do is we are trying to build the best-in-class experience within each category and then allow the customer to choose which one of those experiences make the most sense for them for that particular shopping occasion.  And then DashPass, to your point, is something that we can stitch across to provide the greatest possible value, because we are going to give you everything inside your city within that DashPass membership. So I don't think that we are trying to necessarily steer people one way or the other. I think it's probably intuitive that prepared meal, something like restaurant food is going to have the highest frequency. But that makes sense, because we 20 times to 25 times a week, which is the highest possible shopping category that we have relative to other categories. But that said, I mentioned earlier or to an earlier question that we now are attracting more new customers into the industry outside of restaurant foods than anyone else. And so people are now coming to DoorDash for the first time, not shopping from restaurant food, but also shopping for their grocery items, their liquor needs, their retail items et cetera and et cetera. So I think this is just one of those things where as long as we continue to build the best possible shopping experience within each category and then stitched across the categories and then overlay that with the value of DashPass, we will be in a good position."

With that, Aaron, we'll pass it back to you, and we can take our first question.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you, Andy. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is live.\nNikhil Devnani: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a two-part question on international. So in the past, you've kind of illustrated this dynamic in the U.S. business where as cohorts experienced go forward and mature a little bit you see improvements in the contribution margins by years three and four. Now that you've been operating in some of these international markets for a few years now, have you seen a similar arc and magnitude of improvement on the contribution margin front for these cohorts as well? Or is it a little bit different for market structure reasons or for other reasons? And then my second question is around the degree of fixed cost leverage that you can get operating in so many different countries at once. I'm sure you get to share some technology and talent, but given delivery is hyper local, how do those two things shake out? Is your fixed cost burden in your newer markets lower and easier to overcome or not really? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Hey, Nik, it's Tony. I'll start and Ravi feel free to chime in here. I think on your first question, in short, the answer is yes. We are seeing similar progress both top line and bottom line in our international markets that we saw, while building the U.S. And that's because if we were to rewind the clock three years ago when we first partnered with Volt, what we saw in the company was something that looks very familiar to us at DoorDash, which is a company that has built the leading product when it came to retention and order frequency. And that really is what drives the flywheel in terms of efficient growth. And so we continue to see this past quarter as well as in the last several years of partnering together with both continued strong progress, where we virtually are gaining share in every single market that we play in. and we continue to see the bottom line perform in tandem. And so you are seeing that progression, and it's been very encouraging. I guess, I can start on the second question, and then I'll hand the mic over to Ravi. In terms of fixed cost leverage, in short, the answer is yes. As we add subsequent markets or subsequent even products, we do use, I mean, for all intents and purposes the same team. You're right to say that these are hyper local businesses and services. So we do have to obviously start new in terms of acquiring each of the different audiences. But in terms of the tech stack, in terms of the products, in terms of the know-how whether that's expanding products within a geography or adding net new geographies, you do see that operating leverage.\nRavi Inukonda: Yes. Hey, Nick, let me add a couple of points there, right? Like when you think about the performance of the overall international business. I mean, it has a strong third quarter as well as the year itself has been very strong. When you think about it from a growth perspective, we are growing substantially faster than peers, which essentially means we've gained share in virtually most of the markets that we operate in. Last call, if you recall, I mentioned the fact that the overall international business is gross profit positive. It continues to be the case. The dynamics are similar, right? Like this is a scale-driven business. Our goal has always been, if we find good opportunities to drive retention and order frequency, we're going to double down and invest. That's the same formula we are using in the international market. We are pleased that the gross profit continues to improve. On the fixed cost, I mean, similar dynamics that we saw in the U.S. Again, a lot of it has to deal with scale. But if you recall where we are in the international markets, we are still very early. We're investing behind product, and that's what's causing the strength that you're seeing from a cohort retention and an order frequency perspective.\nNikhil Devnani: Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morton with Moffett Nathanson. Your line is live.\nMichael Morton: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. I wanted to start firstly maybe one for Tony, and then a cohort question for Ravi. It's great to see the Wegmans grocery announcement. Just curious if we're getting closer to seeing an unlock of some of the largest grocers in the country who are not currently on DoorDash platform coming on to DoorDash? And then on the grocery topic and thinking longer term and your ability to make strides into the market. Could you talk about the trends that you see for the grocers who have been on the platform for the like longer extended period of times that you see with larger baskets and maybe larger basket market share trends for the grocers have been on the platform for two years? And then for Ravi your comments on cohorts the last couple of quarters is really encouraging. The new cohorts coming in being as strong as ever. The question that we get from investors is, who are these people? What are the demographics isn't everybody already ordering food and clearly not? So we would love if you could maybe shine a little light on what they look like. Is this skewing younger college age students, more digitally inclined, who are moving out of their home every fall going to college? Anything there would be great. Thanks again.\nTony Xu: Hey, Michael, it's Tony. Yes, on the first question related to grocery, we're pretty excited about what we're seeing in grocery. I mean, we launched grocery at this point almost four years ago now. And the entry point was by delivering a product that was relatively speaking, new to the market, which was solving for this top-up experience, where for consumers, we were replenishing that middle of the week run where you run out of the items that you consume the most often or the earliest or the ones that perish the most frequently, whether that's your berries, your fruits, your dairy products, your coffees, et cetera. And I think what that spurred was both an introduction that was easy to understand for consumers and also something that grocers hadn't seen before and made it very easy to onboard a lot of these grocers. Now all of these things take time, right? I mean we had to build a new catalog from scratch. We obviously wanted to make progress on understanding inventory and the reliability of the inventory fees that we're receiving, which we thought is one of the biggest problems to solve here. And we've made tremendous progress pretty much across the Board, whether that's adding selection, including some of the largest grocers in the country. We're just as excited as you are about Wegmans, but also everyone else that whether that's the corner grocery store to the middle market, grocery stores. And I think this is why you're seeing, when it comes to customer adoption, customers come to DoorDash first, new customers into the grocery delivery industry. And just in general, to delivery outside of restaurants come to DoorDash first, before any other platform. And so I think you're already seeing a lot of this. And in terms of other trends, we see that as customers get used to ordering groceries on DoorDash, they tend to order more items each subsequent visit. So from a cohort perspective, you're noticing that we are increasing both the frequency as well as the spend and wallet share in terms of how consumers spend when it comes to their monthly bills on grocery. And that's increasing with every single cohort. So in short, I think what we've seen is, we have seeing a much bigger market than we expected when it came to launching this pop-up run product, which now has nicely translated into shopping for the other types of occasions, including your weekly stock ups and those types of baskets. And we just continue to see whether it's on the new customer acquisition side, leading share there. And then also on the retention side, positioning us to really continue to grow in a way that will outpace others as well as outpace our previous cohorts.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Mike, it's Ravi. I'll take the one on cohorts side? Maybe I'll just level up and give you broadly on what we're seeing from an underlying cohort perspective. I mean, you're right, we've been very pleased with the cohorts. I think about it like a majority of the volume still comes from existing cohorts for us. The most instructive thing for me when we're operating the business is to look at the engagement of the older cohorts. And if you look at the older cohort, even cohorts as old as five, six, seven years old, we're still seeing good amount of retention as well as overall wallet share increase. And that tells you that the improvements we are making in the product, whether it's selection, whether it's adding new categories, all of that is driving the new, I mean, the cohort trend that you're seeing in the business. From a new cohort perspective, I'll have a couple of ways to think about this, right? One is we're still attracting a healthy amount of new consumers. It's not any different from a demographic perspective. We're starting to see cohorts coming from some of the suburban markets still. And the reason for that is, remember, this is a product that continues to change. We add more selection, grocery, in many cases, the selection is net new to the platform. And the second way we are seeing is not only are consumers new to restaurants, today, we actually add consumers that start their journey with grocery as the first order. That's a net new consumer that we're adding to the platform. But overall, when I look at the underlying cohorts, I mean the strength continues to be very strong, both across existing as well as new.\nMichael Morton: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham. Your line is live.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thanks for taking questions. Just wanted to ask about the partnership strategy, especially in light of the list announcement from tonight. So maybe just talk about the broader partnership strategy. I know you also partner with streaming companies, for example, but is there anything different here with the list that there is the driver component as well?\nTony Xu: Yes. Hey, Bernie, it's Tony. Maybe I can take this one. So one of the things we have at DoorDash that we believe in and follow religiously, is that we keep the main thing, the main thing. And the main thing at DoorDash is building and enabling local commerce. And so when you think about kind of our perspective on all things, partnerships as well as building products, the 80 goes towards building products, which means that it's because that we've offered customers the best combination of selection, quality, affordability and service that we get used the most often our app. And because we get used the most often, it's how we actually are able to build not only the most useful, but also the largest local commerce membership program, which is Dash pass. Now that's the 80. The 20 is the partnerships piece, where for us, we do believe that there are others outside of our network that can offer attractive benefits to our members. You saw this a few years ago when we first launched our partnership with Chase, which we renewed in an expanded way earlier this year. Then you saw the announcement and partnership with MAX, which happened a couple of months ago in terms of adding streaming benefits to DashPass subscribers. And then today's announcement with Lyft, which we're really excited about. Lyft is a service that's used by millions of riders. And many of those riders already are DoorDash customers. Some of them are DashPass subscribers, but a lot of them are also not DashPass subscribers. And so I think it's a great opportunity for us to continue to add engagement to the DashPass program as well as new DashPass members. And in return, lift gets access to the largest local commerce platform that sees the highest frequency program of its kind when it comes to consumer membership programs. And so I think that will be great for them as well. But again, the 80 for us remains to be building the products. And if you think about it, the runway for just organic growth, for DashPass, or really just for our own customer base is this quite large. I mean we have hundreds of millions of customers who order with us every year, whether it's on DoorDash or on Wolt and only a fraction of those are members to either DashPass or Wolt+. So we've got a long ways to go just within our own ecosystem. And then when you look at this from the consumer's perspective, although we've done a reasonably good job in terms of enabling local commerce in the categories that we play in today, we still only represent single-digit fraction of the restaurant industry and a much smaller fraction of that outside of restaurants. So I think there's a long runway ahead, and the main thing for us continues to be improving our products so that we can be the most useful to customers that they use our products most often, which will give us the privilege of having them as members in our programs.\nBernie McTernan: Make sense. Thanks Tony.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question is from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nShweta Khajuria: Thank you so much for taking my questions. Let me try two, please. Ravi, the day rate contributors in the past, you've mentioned its ad growth and platform contribution as well as cost line efficiencies. Could you maybe please rank order them in terms of the impact on take rates as you think about maybe near to midterm? And then on price parity, either Tony or Ravi, where do you think you want to be when it comes to grocery price parity in the mid-to-long term. Is there a future where it's going to be the same as in-store prices? Is that the goal? Or is it that you want to be the most competitively priced online grocery delivery platform? Thank you, Tony.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Shweta, it's Ravi. I'll take the first one on the take rate, right? Let me start by just giving a broader framework around the interplay between revenue and GOV in our business. I mean if you think about revenue, it's been outpacing the GOV growth in our business. That's being driven by ads, as you mentioned, it's been driven by benefits that we get from the commerce platform. And any time we improve efficiency on the cost line, whether it's cash or cost or CLR, that drives revenue. So that's why revenue growth has been outpacing our GOV growth rate. And more specifically, what we saw in the third quarter was two things. One is advertising, and the second one is leverage from Dasher costs. I wouldn't read into the advertising as something has changed in which we operate the business. We are operating the ad business with the same amount of discipline. It's growing in a very healthy manner. We're also very proud of the leverage that we've generated on the Dasher side. A lot of that is being driven by the underlying improvements we are making on the product, and we are pretty happy with that. More broadly, when I think about on a go-forward basis, I would expect revenue to continue to outpace GOV growth. But I would not think of it linearly in terms of the same amount every single quarter. So if you think about the operating philosophy for us, when we find good opportunities to invest, we want to invest flexibly up and down the P&L. Sometimes those opportunities are going to present themselves in the revenue line. And we're pretty happy to take advantage of that.\nTony Xu: Hey, Shweta, it's Tony. On your question on price parity, I think it's a good one. I do think though, in the eyes of the consumer, they think about grocery delivery against a few dimensions at the same instance, and it's not just about price, right? One of the challenges you see in the grocery delivery industry right now is that customers are asked to pay a premium even though they don't get exactly what they ordered. And that's one of the key problems that we're trying to fix here at DoorDash, which is, first and foremost, how do we get customers exactly what they order. We think that we're making great strides against that dimension. But there are other dimensions. Price is one of them, and we are working with each one of our retail partners to making sure that we do have prices as competitive and affordable as possible. We do have some partners already there in terms of having or matching in-store prices. But we think that we can do more there. And at the same instance, we have to continue to offer the level of convenience where we can be faster than what a customer can do on their own. And so I think the combination of those three things of getting people exactly what they ordered at prices that they would expect, certainly faster than they can do it on their own. That's kind of what we're going for. It is the combination of those things in which we're shooting for.\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks, Tony. Thank you, Ravi.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question is from the line of Deepak Mathivanan. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Cameron Lynch [ph] on for Deepak. Just two quick questions. First, can you help us unpack the 19% GOV growth we saw this quarter, a high level between core restaurant and other categories such as grocery, either qualitatively or quantitatively? And second, we saw that AOV trends were up slightly this quarter. Is this due to product mix or bed new price inflation. I would appreciate any additional color you can provide on what's driving this dynamic? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Hey, Cameron. I'll take both of those. I mean look, I mean, we're really pleased with the performance of the business on the growth side. So let me talk about the inputs, and then I'll talk a little bit about the outputs and the various drivers in the business. From an underlying input perspective, right, I mean, the biggest thing for us is looking at the underlying cohorts. I answered the question to Mike, I talked about the fact that the cohorts continue to remain very strong. If I look at users, users are still growing at a double-digit rate. Users hit an all-time high in the quarter. Order frequency continues to be at an all-time high. A lot of that is being driven by the underlying work we've done, whether it's selection, quality or affordability. All this has set us up well, not just for the third quarter, but going forward as well. And from an output perspective, if you think about the various lines of business, the restaurant business, the growth has actually been very stable for the last few quarters. Both grocery new verticals, international they're growing much faster than the restaurant business as well as they have gained share across grocery as well as most of the international markets that we've operated in. And to your second point around the overall AOV increase, we've seen some increase in the overall grocery business. Again, I wouldn't think of that as a major shift. Our goal is to ensure that we are bringing the highest number of consumers to order from more categories and the consumers ordering for more categories, that number continues to increase every single quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Your line is live.\nAndrew Boone: Thanks so much for taking my questions. Ravi, I wanted to ask about the gross profit margin outperformance in the quarter. I understood the call out on the insurance benefit, but is there anything else that you guys want to highlight in terms of the outperformance there? And then Wolt acquired Tazz in Europe. Tony, can you just step back and talk about what may be attractive in terms of M&A targets going forward, and why that specific country and acquisition? Thanks so much.\nRavi Inukonda: Yes, Andrew. I'll take the first one on the gross profit. Let me give you two ways to think about this. If you think of the business as a collection of businesses, what you're seeing is, I mean, we performed really well. The team has executed really well compared to the plan that we have set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. We've driven efficiencies in some parts of the business. We've reinvested that in other parts of the business, and the output is what you're seeing on part of the face of the P&L. More specifically, if you think about the drivers, advertising has obviously been a driver in terms of gross margin improvement. The second thing I would call out, Andrew, is we've talked about the fact that regulatory costs will continue to reduce as we go through the year. That's been another driver. And the last one is efficiency from an overall logistics perspective. But the key thing that I would underscore is -- remember, I mean, we are not operating the business towards a specific gross margin percentage. What we're trying to do is maximize overall profit dollars over the long-term. And the way we do that is every dollar of efficiency we find, we're going to reimburse that back in the business. And our goal is to flexibly invest that up and down the P&L, wherever we see the opportunity. Our goal has always been to build a large business while continuing to be manically focused on unit economics. That's how we've operated, and that's going to be the same philosophy in which we operate the business going forward as well.\nTony Xu: Hey Andrew, it's Tony. On the second question with regards to international M&A. Our standards and VAR continue to remain really high and we are consistent in our approach, which really first and foremost, starts with asking ourselves the question, does this candidate help us launch a new geography, grow our TAM and/or our product portfolio. The second question we ask is, does this help accelerate us in a differentiated way that we couldn't do ourselves organically. Three is, do we believe that by partnering with the candidate that we can achieve long-term cash flows. And the last one, perhaps the most important is do we have a team that has the management talent and bandwidth to execute on the opportunity in a single-threaded way. And when I look at that last one in particular, I mean, Wolt [ph] has been on an incredible run. I mean, ever since well, ever since founding, I mean, actually, I should say that it's now been 10 years for Wolt, actually celebrated 10 years earlier this month, and they've achieved over $15 billion of sales for merchants in their lifetime and $3 billion of earnings for years, and they've just don't rate in their geographies, and they continue to take share virtually everywhere they operate in and they've continued to help us perform just as a management team. And so when I look at the performance over the last three years, they certainly have earned the privilege to continue expansion. And then when I piece that together with TAS, playing in an attractive market in Romania, we get really excited about what the combination can provide.\nAndrew Boone: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. Our next question is from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is live.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Tony, I was wondering if you can comment about DashMart. And maybe can you give us an update like which business models are working and which business model is still working progress? And maybe talk about some of the growth constraints that we should be thinking about? So -- and lastly, it seems like some of the European peers are able to make quick Commerce profitable. Maybe help us understand any differences you're seeing between North America and Europe. Thanks.\nTony Xu: Sure. On DashMart, we're very excited about how they progressed. I mean if I rewind the clock when we started DashMart 3, 3.5 years ago, mean the first push was making sure that we can actually be a national service. And one of the reasons for that was really in search of to help merchants actually because we've always viewed DashMarts over time as an infrastructure in which we can offer retailers to forward deploy their inventory. But first, we needed to prove to ourselves and then certainly to merchants, that we knew how to run these warehouses. And I would say after 3, 3.5 years, the team certainly has achieved that marker. And so that or on their own have done really well in terms of learning how to execute by selling inventory exactly what's on the shelf, which is very differentiated from a selling inventory that's available in third-party stores. They've done it at great prices, and they've done it with awesome selection and very high reliability and speed. And so I think on its own, DashMart have just continued to grow, take share and do really, really well. But that was where DashMarts would end per se. I mean we've also seen quite a lot of progress in terms of our partnership discussions with a lot of retailers. So we've first started that in Canada and partnering with Loblaws, but we've also now have started some of those journeys here in the U.S. as well as in other countries, where we are providing that infrastructure on behalf of retailers so that they can gain additional business at hours that they usually are closed in as well as in geographies that they may not be as penetrated in. So -- we're quite excited about the potential that DashMarts bring both individually, but more so as in partnership with retailers and merchants -- and that's kind of what I expect going forward.\nJames Lee: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is David for Mark. A question on the commerce platform. Do you have any early feedback from merchant customers around the new products that you released last month? And then one more on the Lyft partnership, could you talk about the concentration of DashPass members between urban and suburban markets?\nTony Xu: Sure. On the first question with regards to The DoorDash Commerce platform. I mean this announcement for us really, I would say, has been a few years coming, meaning that it really just encapsulates what DoorDash has now become, which is really two parts, right? Part one of our mission has always been to grow the local economy, and we do that by bringing incremental sales with the wrap. And the second part is to empower local economy to become digital businesses. And so a lot of these physical businesses now are using products like DoorDash Drive or storefronts or some of the other products that we've talked about in order to become digital powerhouses in their own rights and with their own customers. And so -- we are seeing that. I mean when you have hundreds of thousands of businesses now who are part of the DoorDash Commerce platform. So I think the numbers speak for themselves in terms of the excitement. And I guess, from their perspective, if you look at DoorDash, the marketplace as the leading local commerce marketplace, where we do the best job of building products that connect consumers to merchants why wouldn't you want to partner with that and have that for yourself as the retailer that's trying to become more and more digitally native. And so that's what we're seeing. With respect to -- I think your second question about DashPass, I mean we see strength and opportunity in terms of any partnership, whether it's Lyft or Chase or MAX across all of our members. Otherwise, we wouldn't be that excited if it was just trying to target one group of customers while excluding a different group of customers. But again, I think it's important to just understand what the main thing is, 80% of what I believe is important for building membership programs is by building the most useful products, which get used the most often. That's actually how you earn the right to even start a membership program. So that's the 80%. And then the 20 for us is in partnerships, and we're super excited about the Lyft partnership as we are about our other partners, and we believe that they'll help us in any geography.\nRavi Inukonda: And David, just to add to that, right. Like we don't -- I mean if you think about DashPass, itself, it's a leading local commerce subscription program, and we continue to grow. In fact, in the third quarter result, we hit a record number of subscribers, which was an all-time high, over 18 million plus DashPass members. They're everywhere, right? They are not differentiating between urban or suburban. We see strength across the board, which you see in the overall share gains that we've had in the quarter as well.\nOperator: Thanks for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern with BofA. Your line is live.\nMichael McGovern: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I have two -- there's been a lot of attention on the topic of AVs recently, obviously, for rideshare, but do you have a view on the potential future of the delivery use case for autonomous vehicles? Is that something that you may be looking into for your partnership strategy? And then secondly, on restaurant sponsored listings, what are the latest trends that you're seeing in terms of merchant ROACE [ph] and consumer conversion? And how is that playing out in terms of demand for the ads? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Mike, I can take both of those. On the first question related to autonomy. I mean, we're very excited. I think it's been in some ways, as someone who's been working in the autonomous space now for several years. It's a long time coming. I think some of the developments that maybe you've been reading about or seeing -- so maybe that's where I'll start which say that we've been working on the autonomy delivery problem for several years now dating as far back as 2017. And I think the most important thing to tell you about it after working on it for a while now is that it's actually quite different from autonomous right halo. And it's probably obvious to states. But when you don't have a passenger who can just easily go in and come out of the vehicle, and you have to actually load and unload the vehicle when it comes to item delivery, that last 10 feet is actually quite tricky. And so it reminds me a lot of actually how DoorDash got started. I think when DoorDash got started 11 years ago, a lot of people thought, oh, you should -- this is delivery and something like ride hailing might be similar when it comes to dispatch algorithms or something like that. But if you were to apply the same dispatch algorithm for ride hailing as you did for delivery, you'd almost always make the wrong decision. If you dispatch the closest driver to a passenger, for example, which is what you would do in ride hailing and you apply that to delivery and either the inventory is not available or the food is not ready, then you kind of wasted everyone's time. And I would say that they are very fundamental differences in a similar way for autonomous delivery versus autonomous ride hailing. And so we're taking a first principles approach in terms of what we're building at DoorDash and in terms of marrying technology as well as operations to build a system to make this work. We're pretty excited about what we're working on as well as conversations with potential partners as well. But it's a very different problem from maybe some of the things that you've read and but we'll have hopefully some things to share in the future, and we'll tell you more about it then. The second question was around, I think, just adds and just trends in that business. I think more and more of what you're saying is that you just see kind of a continued progress on that business. And I think it starts from the fact that our marketplace continues to grow at pretty high rates, given its scale. And I've always said that a successful ads business is preceded and always preceded by a successful marketplace business. And so that's what we continue to see where our ads business continues to have leading ROACE or return on ad spend for advertisers for restaurants and increasingly for retailers. And we see our consumer conversion improving as well where they're approaching organic rates. And so I think the combination of these two things in tandem with a marketplace that is the largest for what it does in terms of connecting consumers locally to merchants, that's why you're seeing some of the results in terms of the ads business continuing to grow at very high rates at high scale.\nMichael McGovern: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. [Operator Instructions] We have our next question from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nLee Horowitz: Hi, thanks. Maybe sticking with ads and moving over to CPG advertising. You guys have obviously been stacking multiple quarters of really strong grocery volume growth and getting that marketplace to scale. I guess this is probably presumably grabbing the attention of your CPG advertising partners. Have you gotten any indication from those partners in your conversations as they think about budgets for next year, that they be leaning a bit more aggressively into your platform, just given how much you have grown over the last year or so?\nTony Xu: Yes, I can follow on to the answer to the last question here. I mean the short answer is yes. I mean I think CPG advertisers have always been really excited about us because not only because of our strength in growth outside of restaurants, but also just the combined view that we can offer because you can certainly sell a CPG item across both restaurants and retailers across multiple categories. And by being the largest local commerce player, we get to offer the most data and most views and most shots on goal for every brand to win their fair share. And I think that's what's increasing the excitement. On the flip side, I think the team, our team also deserves quite a lot of credit for building and maturing the product portfolio, which is still an area of emphasis for both our CPG ad partners as well as our restaurant partners.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks. And maybe one follow-up just on grocery competition holistically. Obviously, it's very fierce. You have first-party delivery partners who can perhaps lean in on price, given vertical integration. You have other marketplaces that have other verticals that they can monetize on besides grocery and then obviously some focused grocery marketplaces. I guess within that hypercompetitive environment, where do you see as the most defensible sort of characteristics for DoorDash that should allow you guys to come out as one of the key winners in this vertical over a longer period of time.\nTony Xu: Well, it starts with building the best product. I mean -- and I think this is kind of how you get out of any competitive market. I mean if you look at the restaurant delivery industry, that's how it started 11 years ago, too. And I think that the way that DoorDash has come to its current position in restaurant delivery, whether it's in the U.S. or whether you look at us outside the U.S. or Wolt outside of the U.S. It starts by building the product that achieves the highest retention and order frequency, which was -- which is really a testament that you built the best product. And it allows you to most efficiently grow. So I think, first and foremost, it comes down to product execution. And I think you're seeing that. I mean you're seeing that where we are now the first place that consumers come to grocery delivery for, if they are a new customer to grocery delivery, that's also true if you're just getting something delivered locally outside of restaurants. And so we're seeing that -- it's always been true for us in restaurants or for several years now, it's been true where over half of customers that are shopping for restaurant delivery first comes to us for deliveries now outside of restaurants. It's approaching that market, too. And so we're seeing that. We're seeing strength on the retention and frequency side with every single cohort that continues to increase as we improve our selection, improve our pricing, improve our quality of delivery, improve our service. And I think that the maniacal focus is what allows you to build the compounding advantage over time and allows you to grow at higher rates over multiple years.\nRavi Inukonda: And Lee, just to add to that, right, just on the consumer side, but we get good feedback from the merchant side as well, where merchants that we partner with have said that we're driving incremental same-store sales growth for them. The quality that we drive to the merchant has also been great. And you see that in the results where, A, we are the fastest growing in the U.S. as well as gaining share. And also from a cohort perspective, right, the retention and order frequency continues to increase.\nTony Xu: Yes. I think the final thing I believe Lee is that like we also just get the most shots on goal. When you think about what gets delivered most often, it's prepared meals, which is in a different way of saying restaurant delivery. And because we're the leading player in that space and because we're also both in terms of size as well as the frequency we just get more at [indiscernible] with these customers, which is very helpful, especially if you're not in the restaurant category, say, in grocery or other retail categories. And it's also really helpful for advertisers, too.\nLee Horowitz: Helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. We have a final question for today from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Your line is live.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great, thanks for squeezing me in here. So I want to start with sales and marketing leverage continues to be a really nice tailwind for EBITDA. Can you peel back the onion and talk a little bit about contribution from driver incentives. And sort of when you think about beyond the near term and look at supply and demand dynamics and your investments in driver experience, how are you thinking about the magnitude of the ongoing contribution to margin expansion from leverage on incentives? And second question, just turning to grocery. How important is capturing more of that big basket weekly shop to your long-term profit aspirations in grocery? And what are the capabilities and investments you still need to make to start driving more of those large basket orders? Thanks.\nRavi Inukonda: Yes, John, I'll start, Tony will be back. On your point around sales and marketing, I mean, look, John, when I think about sales and marketing or any type of operational efficiency that we drive in the business, it always starts with product because ultimately, product drives retention for us, which drives leverage in sales and marketing. If you break that apart, we've seen a lot of leverage on Dasher acquisition over the last couple of years. A lot of that is being driven by the product improvements that we've made. It's easier for Dashers to onboard. It's easier for Dashers to get paid, all of that is driving retention of existing Dashers higher, which ultimately drives leverage from a sales and marketing perspective. The second thing I would say is even on the consumer side, the teams have done a pretty good job of optimizing at a channel level. So you're seeing leverage from a consumer acquisition cost perspective as well. Looking ahead, I mean, I do expect us to continue to improve the product, which ultimately will drive leverage on sales and marketing. But I expect the pace of change to be slightly slower than what we saw in the last couple of years. But overall, when I think about whether it's Dasher acquisition or consumer acquisition, there's still opportunity for us to continue to go and drive leverage there.\nTony Xu: And John, on the second question with regards to just larger baskets and grocery. I mean, I would all of that for us is really just cherries on top of the cake, meaning that we don't actually need large baskets to make the math work for grocery. And that's because we have the lowest cost structure when it comes to delivery and logistics. And so one of the things that we've been able to do is actually build a very high-growth business with these smaller baskets as a way to introduce ourselves to consumers and grocers alike. And I think it's actually surprised us just how large that market is. I think in some ways, it resembles almost what happens in Europe, where people instead of buying one large basket for the week, they might buy several smaller baskets for the week. I think that's a phenomenon that we can afford that others may not be able to. I think -- so anything that we get, and we are getting these larger baskets, especially after customers buy with us a couple of times they start mirroring kind of their habits, where they will buy maybe a couple of smaller baskets during the week and by one large basket on the weekend. So we are seeing that. And we see that with every single subsequent order. We also see that with every subsequent cohort. But it doesn't have to be a focus for us to make the business financially sustainable.\nRavi Inukonda: John, just to add to that, right, I wouldn't think of it as a large basket versus a small basket. For us, when we build the business, we're trying to build the business for all baskets. If you think about it going back to your sales and marketing question, we have a strategic advantage because remember, we already have consumers on the platform. We already have Dashers on the platform. So the flow-through from a gross margin to contribution margin for us is very high. When I think about the unit economics, team has done a phenomenal amount of work over the course of the last year. When I look at that in the P&L, that doesn't concern me. We have a combination of us being able to make the math work at smaller baskets, plus the sales and marketing leverage where we are focused on is what's the size of the opportunity in terms of scale as well as overall gross profit dollars.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question and ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our DoorDash Q3 2024 earnings call. Thank you for attending. Have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Ravi Inukonda",
            "content": "Yes. Hey, Nick, let me add a couple of points there, right? Like when you think about the performance of the overall international business. I mean, it has a strong third quarter as well as the year itself has been very strong. When you think about it from a growth perspective, we are growing substantially faster than peers, which essentially means we've gained share in virtually most of the markets that we operate in. Last call, if you recall, I mentioned the fact that the overall international business is gross profit positive. It continues to be the case. The dynamics are similar, right? Like this is a scale-driven business. Our goal has always been, if we find good opportunities to drive retention and order frequency, we're going to double down and invest. That's the same formula we are using in the international market. We are pleased that the gross profit continues to improve. On the fixed cost, I mean, similar dynamics that we saw in the U.S. Again, a lot of it has to deal with scale. But if you recall where we are in the international markets, we are still very early. We're investing behind product, and that's what's causing the strength that you're seeing from a cohort retention and an order frequency perspective. Hey, Mike, it's Ravi. I'll take the one on cohorts side? Maybe I'll just level up and give you broadly on what we're seeing from an underlying cohort perspective. I mean, you're right, we've been very pleased with the cohorts. I think about it like a majority of the volume still comes from existing cohorts for us. The most instructive thing for me when we're operating the business is to look at the engagement of the older cohorts. And if you look at the older cohort, even cohorts as old as five, six, seven years old, we're still seeing good amount of retention as well as overall wallet share increase. And that tells you that the improvements we are making in the product, whether it's selection, whether it's adding new categories, all of that is driving the new, I mean, the cohort trend that you're seeing in the business. From a new cohort perspective, I'll have a couple of ways to think about this, right? One is we're still attracting a healthy amount of new consumers. It's not any different from a demographic perspective. We're starting to see cohorts coming from some of the suburban markets still. And the reason for that is, remember, this is a product that continues to change. We add more selection, grocery, in many cases, the selection is net new to the platform. And the second way we are seeing is not only are consumers new to restaurants, today, we actually add consumers that start their journey with grocery as the first order. That's a net new consumer that we're adding to the platform. But overall, when I look at the underlying cohorts, I mean the strength continues to be very strong, both across existing as well as new. Hey, Shweta, it's Ravi. I'll take the first one on the take rate, right? Let me start by just giving a broader framework around the interplay between revenue and GOV in our business. I mean if you think about revenue, it's been outpacing the GOV growth in our business. That's being driven by ads, as you mentioned, it's been driven by benefits that we get from the commerce platform. And any time we improve efficiency on the cost line, whether it's cash or cost or CLR, that drives revenue. So that's why revenue growth has been outpacing our GOV growth rate. And more specifically, what we saw in the third quarter was two things. One is advertising, and the second one is leverage from Dasher costs. I wouldn't read into the advertising as something has changed in which we operate the business. We are operating the ad business with the same amount of discipline. It's growing in a very healthy manner. We're also very proud of the leverage that we've generated on the Dasher side. A lot of that is being driven by the underlying improvements we are making on the product, and we are pretty happy with that. More broadly, when I think about on a go-forward basis, I would expect revenue to continue to outpace GOV growth. But I would not think of it linearly in terms of the same amount every single quarter. So if you think about the operating philosophy for us, when we find good opportunities to invest, we want to invest flexibly up and down the P&L. Sometimes those opportunities are going to present themselves in the revenue line. And we're pretty happy to take advantage of that. Yes, Andrew. I'll take the first one on the gross profit. Let me give you two ways to think about this. If you think of the business as a collection of businesses, what you're seeing is, I mean, we performed really well. The team has executed really well compared to the plan that we have set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. We've driven efficiencies in some parts of the business. We've reinvested that in other parts of the business, and the output is what you're seeing on part of the face of the P&L. More specifically, if you think about the drivers, advertising has obviously been a driver in terms of gross margin improvement. The second thing I would call out, Andrew, is we've talked about the fact that regulatory costs will continue to reduce as we go through the year. That's been another driver. And the last one is efficiency from an overall logistics perspective. But the key thing that I would underscore is -- remember, I mean, we are not operating the business towards a specific gross margin percentage. What we're trying to do is maximize overall profit dollars over the long-term. And the way we do that is every dollar of efficiency we find, we're going to reimburse that back in the business. And our goal is to flexibly invest that up and down the P&L, wherever we see the opportunity. Our goal has always been to build a large business while continuing to be manically focused on unit economics. That's how we've operated, and that's going to be the same philosophy in which we operate the business going forward as well. And David, just to add to that, right. Like we don't -- I mean if you think about DashPass, itself, it's a leading local commerce subscription program, and we continue to grow. In fact, in the third quarter result, we hit a record number of subscribers, which was an all-time high, over 18 million plus DashPass members. They're everywhere, right? They are not differentiating between urban or suburban. We see strength across the board, which you see in the overall share gains that we've had in the quarter as well.

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Hey, Nik, it's Tony. I'll start and Ravi feel free to chime in here. I think on your first question, in short, the answer is yes. We are seeing similar progress both top line and bottom line in our international markets that we saw, while building the U.S. And that's because if we were to rewind the clock three years ago when we first partnered with Volt, what we saw in the company was something that looks very familiar to us at DoorDash, which is a company that has built the leading product when it came to retention and order frequency. And that really is what drives the flywheel in terms of efficient growth. And so we continue to see this past quarter as well as in the last several years of partnering together with both continued strong progress, where we virtually are gaining share in every single market that we play in. and we continue to see the bottom line perform in tandem. And so you are seeing that progression, and it's been very encouraging. I guess, I can start on the second question, and then I'll hand the mic over to Ravi. In terms of fixed cost leverage, in short, the answer is yes. As we add subsequent markets or subsequent even products, we do use, I mean, for all intents and purposes the same team. You're right to say that these are hyper local businesses and services. So we do have to obviously start new in terms of acquiring each of the different audiences. But in terms of the tech stack, in terms of the products, in terms of the know-how whether that's expanding products within a geography or adding net new geographies, you do see that operating leverage. Hey, Michael, it's Tony. Yes, on the first question related to grocery, we're pretty excited about what we're seeing in grocery. I mean, we launched grocery at this point almost four years ago now. And the entry point was by delivering a product that was relatively speaking, new to the market, which was solving for this top-up experience, where for consumers, we were replenishing that middle of the week run where you run out of the items that you consume the most often or the earliest or the ones that perish the most frequently, whether that's your berries, your fruits, your dairy products, your coffees, et cetera. And I think what that spurred was both an introduction that was easy to understand for consumers and also something that grocers hadn't seen before and made it very easy to onboard a lot of these grocers. Now all of these things take time, right? I mean we had to build a new catalog from scratch. We obviously wanted to make progress on understanding inventory and the reliability of the inventory fees that we're receiving, which we thought is one of the biggest problems to solve here. And we've made tremendous progress pretty much across the Board, whether that's adding selection, including some of the largest grocers in the country. We're just as excited as you are about Wegmans, but also everyone else that whether that's the corner grocery store to the middle market, grocery stores. And I think this is why you're seeing, when it comes to customer adoption, customers come to DoorDash first, new customers into the grocery delivery industry. And just in general, to delivery outside of restaurants come to DoorDash first, before any other platform. And so I think you're already seeing a lot of this. And in terms of other trends, we see that as customers get used to ordering groceries on DoorDash, they tend to order more items each subsequent visit. So from a cohort perspective, you're noticing that we are increasing both the frequency as well as the spend and wallet share in terms of how consumers spend when it comes to their monthly bills on grocery. And that's increasing with every single cohort. So in short, I think what we've seen is, we have seeing a much bigger market than we expected when it came to launching this pop-up run product, which now has nicely translated into shopping for the other types of occasions, including your weekly stock ups and those types of baskets. And we just continue to see whether it's on the new customer acquisition side, leading share there. And then also on the retention side, positioning us to really continue to grow in a way that will outpace others as well as outpace our previous cohorts. Yes. Hey, Bernie, it's Tony. Maybe I can take this one. So one of the things we have at DoorDash that we believe in and follow religiously, is that we keep the main thing, the main thing. And the main thing at DoorDash is building and enabling local commerce. And so when you think about kind of our perspective on all things, partnerships as well as building products, the 80 goes towards building products, which means that it's because that we've offered customers the best combination of selection, quality, affordability and service that we get used the most often our app. And because we get used the most often, it's how we actually are able to build not only the most useful, but also the largest local commerce membership program, which is Dash pass. Now that's the 80. The 20 is the partnerships piece, where for us, we do believe that there are others outside of our network that can offer attractive benefits to our members. You saw this a few years ago when we first launched our partnership with Chase, which we renewed in an expanded way earlier this year. Then you saw the announcement and partnership with MAX, which happened a couple of months ago in terms of adding streaming benefits to DashPass subscribers. And then today's announcement with Lyft, which we're really excited about. Lyft is a service that's used by millions of riders. And many of those riders already are DoorDash customers. Some of them are DashPass subscribers, but a lot of them are also not DashPass subscribers. And so I think it's a great opportunity for us to continue to add engagement to the DashPass program as well as new DashPass members. And in return, lift gets access to the largest local commerce platform that sees the highest frequency program of its kind when it comes to consumer membership programs. And so I think that will be great for them as well. But again, the 80 for us remains to be building the products. And if you think about it, the runway for just organic growth, for DashPass, or really just for our own customer base is this quite large. I mean we have hundreds of millions of customers who order with us every year, whether it's on DoorDash or on Wolt and only a fraction of those are members to either DashPass or Wolt+. So we've got a long ways to go just within our own ecosystem. And then when you look at this from the consumer's perspective, although we've done a reasonably good job in terms of enabling local commerce in the categories that we play in today, we still only represent single-digit fraction of the restaurant industry and a much smaller fraction of that outside of restaurants. So I think there's a long runway ahead, and the main thing for us continues to be improving our products so that we can be the most useful to customers that they use our products most often, which will give us the privilege of having them as members in our programs. Hey, Shweta, it's Tony. On your question on price parity, I think it's a good one. I do think though, in the eyes of the consumer, they think about grocery delivery against a few dimensions at the same instance, and it's not just about price, right? One of the challenges you see in the grocery delivery industry right now is that customers are asked to pay a premium even though they don't get exactly what they ordered. And that's one of the key problems that we're trying to fix here at DoorDash, which is, first and foremost, how do we get customers exactly what they order. We think that we're making great strides against that dimension. But there are other dimensions. Price is one of them, and we are working with each one of our retail partners to making sure that we do have prices as competitive and affordable as possible. We do have some partners already there in terms of having or matching in-store prices. But we think that we can do more there. And at the same instance, we have to continue to offer the level of convenience where we can be faster than what a customer can do on their own. And so I think the combination of those three things of getting people exactly what they ordered at prices that they would expect, certainly faster than they can do it on their own. That's kind of what we're going for. It is the combination of those things in which we're shooting for. Hey, Cameron. I'll take both of those. I mean look, I mean, we're really pleased with the performance of the business on the growth side. So let me talk about the inputs, and then I'll talk a little bit about the outputs and the various drivers in the business. From an underlying input perspective, right, I mean, the biggest thing for us is looking at the underlying cohorts. I answered the question to Mike, I talked about the fact that the cohorts continue to remain very strong. If I look at users, users are still growing at a double-digit rate. Users hit an all-time high in the quarter. Order frequency continues to be at an all-time high. A lot of that is being driven by the underlying work we've done, whether it's selection, quality or affordability. All this has set us up well, not just for the third quarter, but going forward as well. And from an output perspective, if you think about the various lines of business, the restaurant business, the growth has actually been very stable for the last few quarters. Both grocery new verticals, international they're growing much faster than the restaurant business as well as they have gained share across grocery as well as most of the international markets that we've operated in. And to your second point around the overall AOV increase, we've seen some increase in the overall grocery business. Again, I wouldn't think of that as a major shift. Our goal is to ensure that we are bringing the highest number of consumers to order from more categories and the consumers ordering for more categories, that number continues to increase every single quarter. Hey Andrew, it's Tony. On the second question with regards to international M&A. Our standards and VAR continue to remain really high and we are consistent in our approach, which really first and foremost, starts with asking ourselves the question, does this candidate help us launch a new geography, grow our TAM and/or our product portfolio. The second question we ask is, does this help accelerate us in a differentiated way that we couldn't do ourselves organically. Three is, do we believe that by partnering with the candidate that we can achieve long-term cash flows. And the last one, perhaps the most important is do we have a team that has the management talent and bandwidth to execute on the opportunity in a single-threaded way. And when I look at that last one in particular, I mean, Wolt [ph] has been on an incredible run. I mean, ever since well, ever since founding, I mean, actually, I should say that it's now been 10 years for Wolt, actually celebrated 10 years earlier this month, and they've achieved over $15 billion of sales for merchants in their lifetime and $3 billion of earnings for years, and they've just don't rate in their geographies, and they continue to take share virtually everywhere they operate in and they've continued to help us perform just as a management team. And so when I look at the performance over the last three years, they certainly have earned the privilege to continue expansion. And then when I piece that together with TAS, playing in an attractive market in Romania, we get really excited about what the combination can provide. Sure. On DashMart, we're very excited about how they progressed. I mean if I rewind the clock when we started DashMart 3, 3.5 years ago, mean the first push was making sure that we can actually be a national service. And one of the reasons for that was really in search of to help merchants actually because we've always viewed DashMarts over time as an infrastructure in which we can offer retailers to forward deploy their inventory. But first, we needed to prove to ourselves and then certainly to merchants, that we knew how to run these warehouses. And I would say after 3, 3.5 years, the team certainly has achieved that marker. And so that or on their own have done really well in terms of learning how to execute by selling inventory exactly what's on the shelf, which is very differentiated from a selling inventory that's available in third-party stores. They've done it at great prices, and they've done it with awesome selection and very high reliability and speed. And so I think on its own, DashMart have just continued to grow, take share and do really, really well. But that was where DashMarts would end per se. I mean we've also seen quite a lot of progress in terms of our partnership discussions with a lot of retailers. So we've first started that in Canada and partnering with Loblaws, but we've also now have started some of those journeys here in the U.S. as well as in other countries, where we are providing that infrastructure on behalf of retailers so that they can gain additional business at hours that they usually are closed in as well as in geographies that they may not be as penetrated in. So -- we're quite excited about the potential that DashMarts bring both individually, but more so as in partnership with retailers and merchants -- and that's kind of what I expect going forward. Sure. On the first question with regards to The DoorDash Commerce platform. I mean this announcement for us really, I would say, has been a few years coming, meaning that it really just encapsulates what DoorDash has now become, which is really two parts, right? Part one of our mission has always been to grow the local economy, and we do that by bringing incremental sales with the wrap. And the second part is to empower local economy to become digital businesses. And so a lot of these physical businesses now are using products like DoorDash Drive or storefronts or some of the other products that we've talked about in order to become digital powerhouses in their own rights and with their own customers. And so -- we are seeing that. I mean when you have hundreds of thousands of businesses now who are part of the DoorDash Commerce platform. So I think the numbers speak for themselves in terms of the excitement. And I guess, from their perspective, if you look at DoorDash, the marketplace as the leading local commerce marketplace, where we do the best job of building products that connect consumers to merchants why wouldn't you want to partner with that and have that for yourself as the retailer that's trying to become more and more digitally native. And so that's what we're seeing. With respect to -- I think your second question about DashPass, I mean we see strength and opportunity in terms of any partnership, whether it's Lyft or Chase or MAX across all of our members. Otherwise, we wouldn't be that excited if it was just trying to target one group of customers while excluding a different group of customers. But again, I think it's important to just understand what the main thing is, 80% of what I believe is important for building membership programs is by building the most useful products, which get used the most often. That's actually how you earn the right to even start a membership program. So that's the 80%. And then the 20 for us is in partnerships, and we're super excited about the Lyft partnership as we are about our other partners, and we believe that they'll help us in any geography. Mike, I can take both of those. On the first question related to autonomy. I mean, we're very excited. I think it's been in some ways, as someone who's been working in the autonomous space now for several years. It's a long time coming. I think some of the developments that maybe you've been reading about or seeing -- so maybe that's where I'll start which say that we've been working on the autonomy delivery problem for several years now dating as far back as 2017. And I think the most important thing to tell you about it after working on it for a while now is that it's actually quite different from autonomous right halo. And it's probably obvious to states. But when you don't have a passenger who can just easily go in and come out of the vehicle, and you have to actually load and unload the vehicle when it comes to item delivery, that last 10 feet is actually quite tricky. And so it reminds me a lot of actually how DoorDash got started. I think when DoorDash got started 11 years ago, a lot of people thought, oh, you should -- this is delivery and something like ride hailing might be similar when it comes to dispatch algorithms or something like that. But if you were to apply the same dispatch algorithm for ride hailing as you did for delivery, you'd almost always make the wrong decision. If you dispatch the closest driver to a passenger, for example, which is what you would do in ride hailing and you apply that to delivery and either the inventory is not available or the food is not ready, then you kind of wasted everyone's time. And I would say that they are very fundamental differences in a similar way for autonomous delivery versus autonomous ride hailing. And so we're taking a first principles approach in terms of what we're building at DoorDash and in terms of marrying technology as well as operations to build a system to make this work. We're pretty excited about what we're working on as well as conversations with potential partners as well. But it's a very different problem from maybe some of the things that you've read and but we'll have hopefully some things to share in the future, and we'll tell you more about it then. The second question was around, I think, just adds and just trends in that business. I think more and more of what you're saying is that you just see kind of a continued progress on that business. And I think it starts from the fact that our marketplace continues to grow at pretty high rates, given its scale. And I've always said that a successful ads business is preceded and always preceded by a successful marketplace business. And so that's what we continue to see where our ads business continues to have leading ROACE or return on ad spend for advertisers for restaurants and increasingly for retailers. And we see our consumer conversion improving as well where they're approaching organic rates. And so I think the combination of these two things in tandem with a marketplace that is the largest for what it does in terms of connecting consumers locally to merchants, that's why you're seeing some of the results in terms of the ads business continuing to grow at very high rates at high scale. Yes, I can follow on to the answer to the last question here. I mean the short answer is yes. I mean I think CPG advertisers have always been really excited about us because not only because of our strength in growth outside of restaurants, but also just the combined view that we can offer because you can certainly sell a CPG item across both restaurants and retailers across multiple categories. And by being the largest local commerce player, we get to offer the most data and most views and most shots on goal for every brand to win their fair share. And I think that's what's increasing the excitement. On the flip side, I think the team, our team also deserves quite a lot of credit for building and maturing the product portfolio, which is still an area of emphasis for both our CPG ad partners as well as our restaurant partners. Well, it starts with building the best product. I mean -- and I think this is kind of how you get out of any competitive market. I mean if you look at the restaurant delivery industry, that's how it started 11 years ago, too. And I think that the way that DoorDash has come to its current position in restaurant delivery, whether it's in the U.S. or whether you look at us outside the U.S. or Wolt outside of the U.S. It starts by building the product that achieves the highest retention and order frequency, which was -- which is really a testament that you built the best product. And it allows you to most efficiently grow. So I think, first and foremost, it comes down to product execution. And I think you're seeing that. I mean you're seeing that where we are now the first place that consumers come to grocery delivery for, if they are a new customer to grocery delivery, that's also true if you're just getting something delivered locally outside of restaurants. And so we're seeing that -- it's always been true for us in restaurants or for several years now, it's been true where over half of customers that are shopping for restaurant delivery first comes to us for deliveries now outside of restaurants. It's approaching that market, too. And so we're seeing that. We're seeing strength on the retention and frequency side with every single cohort that continues to increase as we improve our selection, improve our pricing, improve our quality of delivery, improve our service. And I think that the maniacal focus is what allows you to build the compounding advantage over time and allows you to grow at higher rates over multiple years. Yes. I think the final thing I believe Lee is that like we also just get the most shots on goal. When you think about what gets delivered most often, it's prepared meals, which is in a different way of saying restaurant delivery. And because we're the leading player in that space and because we're also both in terms of size as well as the frequency we just get more at [indiscernible] with these customers, which is very helpful, especially if you're not in the restaurant category, say, in grocery or other retail categories. And it's also really helpful for advertisers, too. And John, on the second question with regards to just larger baskets and grocery. I mean, I would all of that for us is really just cherries on top of the cake, meaning that we don't actually need large baskets to make the math work for grocery. And that's because we have the lowest cost structure when it comes to delivery and logistics. And so one of the things that we've been able to do is actually build a very high-growth business with these smaller baskets as a way to introduce ourselves to consumers and grocers alike. And I think it's actually surprised us just how large that market is. I think in some ways, it resembles almost what happens in Europe, where people instead of buying one large basket for the week, they might buy several smaller baskets for the week. I think that's a phenomenon that we can afford that others may not be able to. I think -- so anything that we get, and we are getting these larger baskets, especially after customers buy with us a couple of times they start mirroring kind of their habits, where they will buy maybe a couple of smaller baskets during the week and by one large basket on the weekend. So we are seeing that. And we see that with every single subsequent order. We also see that with every subsequent cohort. But it doesn't have to be a focus for us to make the business financially sustainable."

Finally, this call is being audio webcasted on our Investor Relations website, and an audio replay of the call will be available on the same website shortly after the call ends. John, I\u2019ll pass it back to you and we can take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nNikhil Devnani: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about what you\u2019re seeing from an overall demand perspective. There\u2019s a lot of talk right now about softening restaurant demand. Your outlook points to some deceleration, but still looks very healthy. So, I guess, to what degree are you seeing changes in behavior or softening on that front? And my follow-on to that is a bit more of the secular story here. So, I mean, how would you characterize the new customer funnel for the U.S. restaurant marketplace? I think there\u2019s a common perception that all customers should have been acquired during the pandemic, but what do you see on that front in terms of how new customers are still adopting this service today and how does that make you -- how do you think about where we are on kind of the growth curve there? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Hey, Nikhil. It\u2019s Tony. I\u2019ll take both of those and feel free to chime in, Ravi. We\u2019re seeing really strong demand on the consumer side. So, we\u2019re not actually seeing some of the challenges that you may be hearing about or reading about in other headlines. I think there are a few reasons for this. I think, first, we\u2019re still in the early innings of the move towards digital and the overall omnichannel experiences that every restaurant and retailer is participating in and we\u2019re lucky to play in the part that is growing. I mean, if you look at digital only, that\u2019s growing not just for us at DoorDash on our marketplace, it\u2019s also growing for us in our first-party platform as we power a lot of these restaurant and retailer websites for ordering, as well as their delivery channels. And they see that too, by the way. While some restaurants, to your point, may be seeing some headwinds in traffic, I mean, their digital channels are growing very robustly, many multiples of, I think, their overall growth and we see that similarly. But at the same time, we\u2019re still just single-digit penetration in restaurants and outside of restaurants. We\u2019re even lower than that. So, we see a long runway for growth there. The second point I make is that our product continues to get better. I mean, if you looked at our cohort behavior, whether it\u2019s retention or order frequency, I mean, all of these things are as good or better than even our pandemic cohorts for every cohort since the pandemic. And so, I think that\u2019s a reflection and testament to the work that the team is doing. We already have category-leading selection, but we\u2019re continuing to extend that lead. We have the best quality as well as lowest cost logistics network in the most places in the U.S., not just for restaurants, but also for retail. That continues to get more accurate and faster. We continue to work on our affordability programs. I mean, DashPass had an all-time high in terms of its subscriber base. So, I think a lot of people are resonating across all of the dimensions in which we are judged from the consumer\u2019s view. The final point I make is that, we are increasing the number of use cases on DoorDash. We continue to see just tremendous growth, much faster than the industry, I mean, many, many, many fold faster than anyone else, both in the U.S. as well as globally in restaurants, but also outside of restaurants. And increasingly, we\u2019re seeing customers come to us for the first time actually for non-restaurant use cases. And so, in terms of your question on new customers, I mean, we actually see a couple of things. One, we still acquire more than anyone else. I mean, more than -- in restaurants, more than one out of every two new customers that come into the industry. Outside of restaurants, we\u2019re about one in every two. So, in any category of local commerce, we acquire more new customers than anyone else. And I think what you see about the point about like, \u201cHey, look, is the new customer point saturating?\u201d The way I think about this is for us at DoorDash, yes, we have tens of millions of customers every single month, but we have many multiples of that ordering with us every single year. So, within even our own ecosystem, whether they\u2019re a new customer or a customer that\u2019s an occasional customer that\u2019s coming back now to the platform, within our own ecosystem, we have a long runway for growth. And so, yes, we\u2019re getting new customers, especially in restaurants and new categories. I mean, I mentioned some of those stats, but we\u2019re also getting customers who are in our ecosystem. They don\u2019t participate yet with us every single month or every single day, but increasingly, they\u2019re getting this.\nRavi Inukonda: So, Nikhil, just to add a couple of points to what Tony talked about, right? The demand on the platform continues to be very strong. When we look at the underlying cohorts, they\u2019re very strong. The recent cohorts are actually as strong as any of the older cohorts that we\u2019ve seen. Even for the core restaurant business, when I look at the growth rate in GOV on a year-over-year basis, the growth in Q2 is very consistent with what we saw in Q1. Even from a linearity perspective, the business actually grew faster in June compared to April. Tony talked about some of this, but DashPass had a really strong quarter, all-time high in terms of subscribers, order frequency continues to be at an all-time high. So, the underlying cohort strength is actually very strong and the demand continues to be very strong across the Board for us.\nNikhil Devnani: Thank you, both.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. First one on the take rate, it\u2019s up quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, the revenue take rate. And in the letter, you talked about reducing consumer feed and you just mentioned DashPass growing a lot faster than overall. So, could you talk about, like, what\u2019s driving that? Are you seeing efficiencies on Dasher cost or something else like drive causing that take rate to go up as much as it is? And then the second one is, you also mentioned that the majority of your largest international markets have better retention than U.S. Could you just give us a little bit more color on what\u2019s driving that? Is that kind of the breadth of offering or levels of competition or something else? That\u2019s all. Thanks a lot.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Ross. I\u2019ll take the first one. Tony, feel free to jump in on the second one. But in take rate perspective, Ross, let me break out what\u2019s going on with revenue. If you think about revenue, there\u2019s a few different components. You have the ad business, which is growing really fast. You have a platform business, which is also growing really fast. Both of those are driving the improvement you\u2019re seeing in both revenue growth as well as take rate. At the same time, you also have cost lines, whether it\u2019s Dasher or quality. The team has done a great job of improving that compared to last year, boosting improvements in efficiency. For us, the goal has always been to continue to drive improvements from an efficiency perspective. But at the same time, we\u2019re also going to continue to find opportunities to reinvest that back in growth. As I look ahead from a take rate perspective, I do expect us to improve and grow our ad business, as well as our platform business. Even on the cost line, there\u2019s still lot of opportunity for us to continue to drive improvements in efficiency. At the same time, we\u2019re going to try to find good opportunities where we can drive investments in retention or the frequency while continuing to improve the overall take rate in the business.\nTony Xu: And Ross, on the second question about international markets and just the retention and frequency levels there. I mean, it\u2019s really a story of two things. One is, well, we started with a very robust set of fundamentals and foundation, right? I mean, this really was the key investment thesis behind teaming up with Wolt. I mean, when we were looking internationally in terms of expansion opportunities, one of the things, perhaps, the top thing that got us most excited about teaming up with Wolt was the fact that they had leading retention and frequency in every market that they competed in. And that\u2019s a combination of a few things. But at the end of the day, it comes down to offering the best combination of inputs for customers, the best selection, the best quality of service in terms of delivery quality, the best affordability, and the best support. The second thing I would say is that, since teaming up with Wolt, which closed in 2021, it\u2019s been a couple of years now. We\u2019ve added some of the lessons that we\u2019ve learned at DoorDash, lessons in making improvements to each one of these inputs. And that combination, I think, is what you see that\u2019s driving the growth and virtually taking share gains in every market that we play in.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Morton from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morton: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. If we could maybe do two, one on international, following up on some of the comments Tony just made and then maybe a quick one on groceries. Tony, I love hearing more about the retention aspects for international, but like you talked about in the press release today, two full years with Wolt. Love to learn some more just beyond the retention aspects. Some key takeaways after running this business for two full years on what it takes for the best performance in these international markets. Is it market structure, market share, consumer spending capabilities? And then how that might dictate your plans to grow in new countries and/or maybe exit certain markets where you don\u2019t like the industry structure? And then just a quick one on CPG advertising, some learnings and differences you\u2019ve picked up compared to your restaurant advertising business would be great? Thank you.\nTony Xu: Sure. Yeah. I mean, on the first question regarding international and just lessons learned. I mean, the first thing I would say that -- is that, there\u2019s no silver bullet in operating these kinds of businesses, but the story is really the same in virtually every market. Sure, every market, to your point, has different challenges and different dynamics in the market, but at the end of the day, it comes down to who can create the best service for customers, couriers and merchants. And I think remembering that as simple as it sounds is actually quite important, because I think there\u2019s always a lot of competitive activities in our space, but I think that making sure that you can win on building the best product as measured by the highest retention and frequency levels. I mean, that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve always held ourselves to. That\u2019s what the customer holds us to. And I think that we\u2019ve been lucky in that we\u2019ve been able to achieve that bar at least better than anyone else in all the markets that we plan. But at the same time, it\u2019s also not good enough, if you look at just how underpenetrated so many of these markets are, especially outside of the United States. And that\u2019s true in the restaurants category, but that\u2019s true virtually in every category, which just means that we\u2019ve got a long ways to go before we\u2019re satisfied with what we\u2019ve done for our customers in solving the local commerce opportunity. With respect to CPG, I think, it\u2019s been just a really fast learning curve for us. I think we had a lot of attention and excitement from virtually every top CPG advertiser, because they saw the largest local commerce platform offering ads for the first time three years ago that had the highest frequency, the highest membership base for local commerce and the highest cross-sell between categories. And so, obviously, their question is like, \u201cHey, what are you waiting for? When are you guys going to actually open up the platform, so that we can meet new customers?\u201d At the same time, we also have to balance the other side, which is an advertising business can only be built off the back of a healthy and robust marketplace business, and it doesn\u2019t really go the other way around. You need the marketplace business to grow in order for your advertising business to have a long runway for healthy growth. And so that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve always looked for, but it\u2019s always two guiding principles. How do we offer the best-in-class consumer experience with no degradation in experience, and how do we offer the best return for advertisers? And that\u2019s true for small restaurants, that\u2019s true for big restaurants, that\u2019s true for big CPGs, that\u2019s true for small mid-market CPGs. I think that, one thing that you see now that we\u2019re in the third year of doing this is we\u2019re starting to finally make great progress in just offering a very balanced portfolio. I think we started by offering and introducing ads to restaurants where I think that was, something that was very natural to some of the activities that we had done before then. But now that\u2019s pretty much fully built out for CPGs and I think now it\u2019s making sure that we grow that in a responsible way, achieving, again, the balance between consumer happiness and advertiser returns.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Ravi. Just to add a couple of points that Tony talked about on the international side. Again, the formula for us, like Tony mentioned, is largely similar. We\u2019re seeing strength in retention. We\u2019re seeing strength in order frequency, as well as gross profit. Last call, I talked about the fact that the entire international portfolio is gross profit positive and it has continued to improve. For us, what\u2019s important is we want to drive scale. Scale drives efficiency in the business. We\u2019ve done that in the U.S. and it\u2019s the same formula we\u2019re using in the international market as well.\nMichael Morton: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Boone: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. You mentioned in the press release better frequency for new verticals. Can you help us better understand that for drivers and then where are you seeing better frequency? And then a question really on ramping new merchants. We\u2019ve noticed that incentives are larger. As we think about you guys normalizing on selection, can you just help us understand the size of the investment it takes to bring new merchants onto the platform? Thanks so much.\nTony Xu: I can take the first part of the question. I mean - Andrew, I guess, in general, I mean, we see order frequency increases both within restaurants and incrementally on top of that from new verticals. It depends a lot on the geography and which new selection that has been onboarded or so how strong the selection density is within a market. For example, obviously, we\u2019ve been very strong in grocery and in convenience. That\u2019s been a big focus for us for years. And we\u2019re excited, actually, just this morning, we announced an update to our partnership with Chase, which now makes us Chase\u2019s exclusive partner in both restaurant delivery and grocery delivery for all of their cardholders. And so, I think you\u2019re seeing the appreciation of our performance, not just by consumers, but also by other large companies out there that are trying to tap into a very valuable base of customers, a lot of whom are coming to us for grocery and for these new verticals. But there are examples where we just launched recently, for example, with Ulta Beauty. So as we\u2019ve launched health and beauty, some customers come to us for the first time, whether it\u2019s to Ulta, to Sephora, to other health and beauty merchants for the first time, or Lowe\u2019s in the home improvement category. So, it\u2019s not coming from one area. As we add more categories, we see more order frequency growth.\nRavi Inukonda: Yeah. Andrew, I\u2019ll take the second one. Maybe just a couple of points on the first one that Tony mentioned. Our goal is to drive overall order frequency up. We\u2019re not trying to drive just the restaurant order frequency up or the new verticals order frequency up. In fact, looking at the order frequency in a blended basis is not how we think about the business. It\u2019s truly a cohorted business. When I look at the cohorts, even the age cohorts, they\u2019re engaging better with us. Their order frequency is going up, partly because the product has gotten better. You have more categories. Delivery times have gotten better. The entire order frequency continues to go up. The newer cohorts are actually joining at better order frequency than many of the older cohorts. Andrew, second point on selection investment. I mean, look, I mean, our goal is to continue to drive selection higher. It\u2019s a core part of our strategy. We are adding selection in restaurants. We are definitely adding more selection on the grocery side, as well as international. The way we think about it is, as long as we are driving incremental GOV, as long as the conversion is continuing to increase, we\u2019re going to continue to drive selection higher. And you\u2019re seeing that strength being reflected in not just the demand, but the underlying cohorts of the business as well.\nAndrew Boone: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Erickson: Thanks. I just have two here. One, on the incremental flow through of EBITDA, so relative to GOV, it looks like it picked up a quarter-over-quarter maybe a couple 100 basis points. Can you call out any drivers of the difference there, if you can? And then second, in a bigger picture, Ravi just talked about the improving unit economics on the gross margin side across all parts of the business. So, it kind of seems like that should roughly rhyme with EBITDA expansion over time. What are any other considerations as to why that would not be the case, if you could? Thank you.\nRavi Inukonda: Yeah. Let me take the first one and I\u2019ll get into the second one. On the EBITDA upside that we saw in Q2, there\u2019s two factors, right? One, you saw us continue to drive higher growth. GOV came in better than expectations. The overall business is gross profit positive, so you\u2019re seeing that flow through to the bottomline. Two, you also have improvements in unit economics, gross profit across most major lines of business. You\u2019re seeing that impact the overall business as well. From a philosophy perspective, Brad, I mean, I think, I want to be clear. Our goal is to grow as fast as we can by being inside of the range from an EBITDA perspective. I would expect that to be the case going forward in Q3 as well. But longer term, let me break the business apart, right? On the restaurant side, we\u2019ve done a great job of improving the contribution margin in H1 despite absorbing some of the regulatory costs. There\u2019s still a lot of opportunity for us to continue to drive margin higher there. It\u2019s not going to be at the same clip as we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years. New verticals, as well as international are still early. We\u2019re seeing good growth. We\u2019re seeing good opportunities to continue to invest there. But these businesses are not truly optimized for efficiency. As we continue to drive efficiency higher across the P&L, I would expect margins to continue to improve. More importantly for us, the formula has always been invest behind retention, order frequency, as well as continued improvement in gross profit. We have seen that in the business. If we find good areas to continue to drive investment, we\u2019re going to do that. Our goal is to drive GOV growth while being disciplined from an overall investment perspective.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan from Needham. Please go ahead.\nBernie McTernan: Great. Thank you. Just wanted to stick on international. Tony, you mentioned the shareholder ladder, how international ambitions remain well above what you\u2019ve been able to achieve so far. So, just want to see -- does that mean more countries, different categories or different products coming to your current? And basically, do you have the right asset mix currently to achieve those ambitions?\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Bernie. I mean, I guess, to add to some of the comments I made previously, we have a good foundation to build from in all of our markets. That\u2019s how we start. And if you don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s difficult to solve every local commerce problem. For us, that obviously starts with the restaurant business, which, whether it\u2019s internationally or here in the U.S., we have leading retention and frequency, which is a great place to build upon. And we\u2019ve added quite a lot of categories into all of our markets actually and those are growing really, really nicely. But when I look outside of the U.S., I would say that, the vast majority, virtually every country outside the U.S. for us, is still behind what we think the penetration levels ought to be if we actually brought all of the products that we have in market here in the U.S. overseas. We\u2019re not there yet, right? We have a great house in which the structure is very, very good. We\u2019re growing many folds faster than our peers. We\u2019re doing a nice job of launching new products that we\u2019ve built from the DoorDash side to all of our markets. But on the flip side, I would say that, the levels there are still not where they ought to be. We\u2019ve got a long ways to go on getting restaurant selection where it needs to be. We\u2019re off to a fantastic start outside of restaurants, especially given that retail, I would say, is a little less developed on a comparative basis when you look outside of the U.S. versus, say, the retail industry within the U.S. And then when I look at the five businesses that we have, as well as other businesses that we\u2019re incubating, I think, the potential to bring this globally to be the largest local commerce platform in any country, I think, that remains just a very, very large opportunity for many years of growth.\nBernie McTernan: Makes sense. Thanks, Tony.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael McGovern from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael McGovern: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, again, a little bit about the restaurant menu inflation. Is there any dynamic underlying the AOV number that is basically suggesting that there is some level of food inflation and maybe have some offsetting, things like drive that are making AOV not increase? And then also just quickly, I want to see if you comment on regulatory with Prop 22 being upheld in California and are you still seeing any impact in New York City and Seattle from regulatory changes there? Thank you.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Mike. I\u2019ll take the first one. Tony will take the second one on regulatory. On the first one, I mean, look, I mean, inflation has not had a big impact on our business. If you think about it, like when inflation first peaked about a year ago, we saw fewer items per order. But overall, we\u2019ve also driven consumer fees down. So I look at overall, even the restaurant business from an AOV perspective, it\u2019s relatively flat year on year. So we\u2019re not seeing any impact on that. And pretty pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on overall affordability, which is continuing to drive the growth that you\u2019re seeing in the business.\nTony Xu: Yeah. The second question with respect to regulatory, it\u2019s actually pretty much the same story that I think we\u2019ve communicated ever since doing the first earnings call. And really, it reflects even what we thought 10 years ago when we started forecasting what might be true in regulatory, in particular on the labor piece across the world, which is I think in the majority of the world, the overwhelming majority, most jurisdictions want to actually support us in giving Dashers what they want, which is the flexibility of a work opportunity that\u2019s never existed before and also protections that we believe they deserve. I mean, to your point or the premise of the question, you\u2019re right. I mean, it\u2019s good to see that lawmakers most recently upheld Prop 22 here in California. We expect that. We expected that not just because we\u2019re right on the wall, but because we think it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s actually giving users in this case, the Dasher, the driver, exactly what they\u2019re looking for. I always have to remind people that over 90% of Dashers do fewer than 10 hours a week on the platform. The average Dasher does 3 hours a week to 4 hours a week. The overwhelming majority, over 80%, 85% of Dashers actually have full-time jobs. So they\u2019re specifically telling us, we do not want to be told what hours to work or where to work them. And so we see that most governments, lawmakers around the world, certainly here in the U.S. as well, actually want to do right by the Dasher and actually support us in what we want to do for workers. I also hope whether it\u2019s this election cycle or future election cycles, whether it\u2019s here in the U.S. or around the world, that things will moderate a bit in terms of temperature and that this can be something that we as a company, as well as other companies in the space can work productively with any government to actually achieve what Dashers want. And I don\u2019t know, Ravi, did you want to comment on New York or Seattle or any\u2026\nRavi Inukonda: Yeah.\nTony Xu: \u2026 of these economic activities?\nRavi Inukonda: Yeah. Maybe on New York and Seattle. I talked about the fact in the last call that we did take a meaningful amount of impact on EBITDA from the regulatory cost in Q1. That did come down in Q2, just like I said it would. A lot of that is being driven by the underlying improvements we\u2019ve made in product to drive efficiency higher. I do expect those costs to continue to reduce as we go through the rest of the year. Look, I mean, our goal in philosophy has always been any market that we operate in, want to run with sustainable unit economics, and that\u2019s going to be true for these markets as well. It\u2019s not going to be a step function change. It\u2019s going to be a gradual change. We really like what we\u2019re seeing in the business from an overall efficiency improvement perspective for those markets.\nMichael McGovern: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?\nTony Xu: Yeah. Go ahead, Ron.\nRon Josey: Oh! Great. Perfect. So maybe a follow-up on what we were talking about earlier and all the improvements on efficiencies. The letter -- the press release talked about reducing order defect rates and merchant churn while also lowering fees. And I\u2019m just wondering, this lowering fees, is this passing along the savings and you\u2019re sort of seeing the benefits of, call it, lowering fees, more efficiency, lower fees, higher order rates. It\u2019s all coming together. I wanted to get your thoughts on just, are you passing along these savings to consumers and then therefore seeing improving top line growth? I\u2019m curious on that dynamic. Thank you.\nTony Xu: Yeah. Hey, Ron. It\u2019s Tony. I mean, look, we\u2019re always trying to do one thing, right? Which is to move fees in one direction. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spoken to a consumer who\u2019s asked us to raise prices. And so we are always trying to lower the fees and pass them on. And there\u2019s various ways in which you can do this. We\u2019re obviously trying to be more affordable. We\u2019re trying to increase and widen the selection lead that we have. We are trying to improve the quality of our logistics system. We believe we have the best one, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s perfect. And so we have to get more accurate. We have to get faster. We have to be better about finding every product in the physical world, especially now that a lot of what we do is outside of restaurants and inventory remains a challenge for every physical retailer. And so there\u2019s a lot of work to do. We\u2019re not yet satisfied with where we are on all of the dimensions. We appreciate and tremendously respect all of the efforts that our teams have done in terms of building the best product, in terms of having category leading retention and frequency. We\u2019re not there yet. In the eyes of the consumer, we can still be more affordable. We can still have better selection. We can still have better quality and better support. So we\u2019re working on all of those things.\nRavi Inukonda: And Ron, just to add to that, the way we think about investing is, our goal is to grow as fast as we can while trying to be within the discipline parameters. What you\u2019re seeing in the business is restaurant growth has been very strong. We\u2019re continuing to drive margins there higher. You\u2019re seeing very similar dynamic in both new verticals, as well as international. But not just the growth, but overall improvement in profitability has been higher. For us, whenever we think about a dollar of efficiency, the next step we think about is that back in the business, because you want to drive order rates higher, you want to drive scale higher. The scale ultimately drives efficiency. And that\u2019s the consistent cycle that we\u2019ve been on and nothing has changed in regards to how we operate the business.\nRon Josey: Thank you, Tony. Thank you, Ravi.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks for the questions. In the past, you\u2019ve called out fixed OpEx as a percentage of GOV for 2024 that\u2019s expected to be stable. I guess, is that still the operating assumption that we should be thinking about for this year? And then sort of looking beyond this year, how are you thinking about sort of your ability to drive leverage on a go-forward basis as you digest sort of an admittedly small step in fixed OpEx? And then maybe just on the advertising business, I guess looking out to next year, you guys will have stacked up some really nice growth within your grocery business, which I assume would open up the eyes of some of your CPG ad partners. Would you expect sort of CPG ad participation in the advertising product, perhaps, lag some of the volume growth, as we\u2019ve heard from some of your competitors in this space? Thanks so much.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Lee. I\u2019ll take the one on OpEx. Tony will take the second one. Look, I mean, our goal is not just to grow strongly in 2024, but our goal is to continue to drive strong growth for many years to come. For us, the key there is continue to innovate on the product side. What we\u2019re seeing in the business is continue to invest behind the product. You\u2019re seeing improvements in retention. You\u2019re seeing improvements in order frequency. I mentioned earlier, the 2023 and the 2024 cohorts are as strong as any of the older cohorts we\u2019ve seen. Our philosophy has always been to invest behind the strength that we\u2019re seeing in the business. We are investing, we\u2019re adding resources in select areas, mostly on the engineering and the product side. And I think the benefits of that from an overall growth, as well as an efficiency perspective. As I think about OpEx, I would expect OpEx roughly to be at the same level on a percentage of GOV basis for the rest of the year. I mean, looking forward, our goal is to continue to scale the business and our goal is to drive leverage in OpEx, just like any other part of the P&L.\nTony Xu: Hey, Lee. On the second question about the pacing of CPG ad growth, I mean, we really like what we see, right? I mean, right now the focus, again, and it\u2019ll always be this, is to make sure that the principle that building a great marketplace comes before building a great ad business. And if your marketplace business isn\u2019t growing in a sustainable and healthy way, that\u2019s not going to degrade the consumer experience, it almost doesn\u2019t matter everything that comes after that sentence. And so, for us, I mean, to your point, you\u2019re right. I mean, our new verticals, whether it\u2019s grocery, convenience, alcohol, other retail categories, business is growing really fast. Every CPG is a customer and the question is like, how fast do we get into that spend? The way I think about this is, there\u2019s no rush to doing it. And actually, you can actually make a pretty big mistake if you get into it too quickly. I mean, as long as we have the biggest audience with the greatest level of activity in terms of frequency engagement, retention and frequency, we\u2019re always going to be available to the CPG advertiser. And I think they\u2019re always going to be interested and they\u2019re always looking for the best returns, and I think it tends to come from the marketplaces that aren\u2019t the biggest -- just the biggest, but also the ones with the highest activity and the highest growth rates. And so that\u2019s the balance for us. I mean, our CPG ad business is growing really, really fast. I\u2019m very pleased with the performance by the team. But again, in terms of pacing, I almost think of it as sequencing, which is the health of the marketplace should always come before the monetization of the marketplace.\nLee Horowitz: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nShweta Khajuria: Thank you for taking my question. Let me try two, please. One is on advertising growth. So could you talk about your current ad tech stack and where you are in terms of your product and where you think there is opportunity to continue to grow and gain greater share? That is whether you\u2019re talking about attribution or you\u2019re targeting capabilities or telling CPGs that we can get you incremental customers that you can\u2019t find elsewhere, whatever that is, where are you today and where\u2019s the opportunity? And second is on competitive dynamics. Through the quarter, there was a lot of talk about perhaps you potentially losing share. It clearly doesn\u2019t sound like you are. Could you talk about the -- whether you\u2019re seeing greater competitive intensity in suburban markets in the U.S. and what you\u2019re seeing in international markets? Thanks a lot.\nTony Xu: Sure. I can take both of those and feel free, Ravi, to add in. Hey, Shweta, on the first question on ad tech stack and just where we are, I mean, it\u2019s a three-year-old business. I mean, it\u2019s growing lights out fast. I think if it were a standalone business, people would be very pleased with its performance. But again, to me, it\u2019s not about rushing it. Even though it\u2019s growing really, really fast and we\u2019re in no disadvantage relative to anyone else, it doesn\u2019t mean that we should just step on the gas all the way. So there\u2019s a lot more room. I mean, if you look at where we started with ads, most of the stack was built for restaurants and that probably makes sense given our history. But DoorDash is no longer just a one-category, one-country company. We are five business lines, 30-plus countries. And so to your point, we have to evolve and build maturity in the stack for bigger restaurants, for CPG advertisers, for advertisers across all categories, not just in food, but in all of retail. So I think there\u2019s a very long and straightforward roadmap. What I like is that, their -- and certainly what they\u2019ve told me and also what we see in terms of their investments with us is that they\u2019re ready to go. And they\u2019re always going to be there so long as we offer the best-in-class returns for them, which we believe derive from having the leading marketplace, both in terms of users as well as usage. And I think the rest will take care of itself. So we feel good about the growth there, but there\u2019s a lot more to come. On the second question, I mean, to be candid, we haven\u2019t really seen much change in the competitive landscape. I mean, there might be a lot of activity, but there\u2019s not a lot of progress, if you know what I\u2019m saying. I mean, I think it\u2019s mostly noise that we\u2019ve kind of heard. And I think that whether you look at new customer acquisition, you look at existing behavior, you still see that, at least in the eyes of the consumer, they seem to really prefer DoorDash. And I think what it speaks to is that you\u2019re always going to have a lot of activity. We have seen -- I\u2019ve been doing this for over 11 years. I\u2019ve seen periods of very high promotional activities, high partnership activity, high other forms of activity. But at the end of the day, the one thing that any marketplace or any consumer product is judged on is retention and frequency, and that\u2019s something you can\u2019t cheat. You can\u2019t just game on a one-time basis. And all roads always point back to the marketplace that offers the best combination of selection, quality, price, and support. So far, we are -- that marketplace, as long as we can continue our extension of our lead in the product. I feel really strong about our position, irrespective of activity. But I think it\u2019s always been competitive. I expect it to always be competitive. But in terms of, like, what\u2019s actually happening, whether it\u2019s in suburban markets, urban markets, nothing\u2019s really changed.\nRavi Inukonda: Hey, Shweta. It\u2019s Ravi. Just to add to\u2026\nShweta Khajuria: \u2026 the first point on ads, right? Like, I mean, we\u2019re still very early in our journey, like Tony talked about, right? Like, you\u2019re seeing the impact of ads on both revenue, as well as EBITDA, but the majority of the ad revenue is in the U.S. It\u2019s mostly focused on restaurants at this point, still early from a CPG, as well as an international perspective. We\u2019re holding our teams, you know, with the constraint on conversion as well as merchant relies, as long as those continue to be best-in-class, we\u2019re going to continue to improve the overall ad business.\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks, Ravi.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks for taking my questions. You added tens of thousands of new merchants to the U.S. marketplace. I\u2019m curious how that additional supply compared between the restaurant delivery business and the verticals. And I know that just -- that\u2019s just one of a number of investments that you\u2019re making to help drive improvements to the consumer offering, but I\u2019m curious if you could help frame how much more room you have to continue expanding supply over time? And second question, just curious if you can quantify the impact of New York and Seattle, and the changes that you made there on GOV and EBITDA in the second quarter? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Hey, John. It\u2019s Tony. I\u2019ll take the first one on adding selection and maybe, Ravi, you can take the second one. On adding selection, I mean, it\u2019s really everywhere, John. I mean, there is no like one category we\u2019re particularly targeting. I mean, we are trying to represent every city in a digital way, which means unless we have every breathing merchant that is alive in the city, we don\u2019t have great selection. And so that\u2019s really true. I mean, if you even were to drive out from any city center, our selection probably wanes as you go further out. And so I think we\u2019ve got a long ways to go. And don\u2019t forget also with restaurants, there\u2019s always new restaurants coming in. One interesting fact about the restaurant industry and this is virtually true in every country, is that the total number of restaurants every year almost always exceeds the previous year, but it\u2019s not necessarily the same set of restaurants. And that\u2019s because restaurants come and go, and so there\u2019s always a ton of work to do there. So the room to run on restaurants is almost this perennial kind of body of work. And then with retail, I mean, we\u2019re just getting started. And so I think we have a long ways to go in terms of adding selection.\nRavi Inukonda: John, on New York and Seattle, from an overall GOV perspective, I mean, the combination of both of those markets don\u2019t make up a large portion from an overall company perspective. So the impact from GOV and volume from an overall company perspective has been small. Individual markets we\u2019re seeing some elasticity, but not to impact the overall total company growth rate. From an EBITDA perspective, I mean, look, Q1, I mentioned that we did take a meaningful amount of impact on EBITDA from these costs. That cost did come down in Q2. A lot of that is being driven by improvements we\u2019ve made on the product on the efficiency side. As we go through the rest of the year, I do expect the cost impact from an EBITDA perspective to go down. This was part of the reasoning I mentioned, causing H3 to be higher than H1, where we\u2019re seeing impact from regulatory costs continue to reduce, as well as the volume continues to grow, as well as the gross profit for the various lines of business continue to grow as we go through the rest of the year.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thank you. Maybe switching gears a little bit, talking about price parity, obviously, an important topic. Doesn\u2019t seem to get much progression, though, and I\u2019m curious if you are close to any initiatives that might incentivize grocers to get there, possibly, like, prioritize ad placement, maybe what some of the puts and takes are there? And then maybe flipping the ad expansion discussion on its head. I\u2019m curious where you have seen, maybe in certain verticals or environments, degradation in app engagement or order frequency as a result of increased ad load? Thanks.\nTony Xu: Mark, it\u2019s Tony. I\u2019ll take both of those and feel free to add here, Ravi. Look, on price parity, I mean, you\u2019re absolutely right that it\u2019s an important point in terms of affordability, right? I mean, we\u2019re always trying to make our products and services more affordable. That\u2019s true in restaurants, that\u2019s true in grocery, that\u2019s true in convenience, that\u2019s true across the Board. There\u2019s no simple or silver bullet answer to your question. I mean, we\u2019re constantly working to make sure that we can align the business model and the incentives such that we can offer the most accessible and affordable service. Now, look, all of this comes in conjunction with other things, right? It\u2019s not hold -- you can\u2019t just hold one thing static. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of other things that we have to do in terms of making sure that the inventory is actually there, making sure that if you didn\u2019t get what you were hoping to get, that the substitution we made is perfect or acceptable to you. And so there\u2019s a lot of things that have to come together for what you\u2019re talking about. Price obviously is one component or one input in which we are judged. But there are so many other components too. And they sometimes interplay, right? As we find efficiencies in our logistics work, that\u2019s worth it or if we can rip out inefficiencies that shouldn\u2019t be in our system, those are costs that we can use to help fund other programs. And so there\u2019s a lot going on. There\u2019s no simple answer to your question. But it\u2019s something that will be a perennial part of what we do. On the second question, I mean, it\u2019s a great question, which is that you\u2019re absolutely right that, ads do have an impact, a negative impact on the consumer experience. And it\u2019s why I kind of harp on this all the time where you have to not be confused in terms of what drives what. And in this case, it\u2019s a healthy marketplace that enables an ad business and not the other way around. And so this is one thing in which I think we\u2019ve been more conservative on in making sure that we protect the consumer experience. And so, in terms of seeing degradation, we haven\u2019t seen much of it, partly because of how we\u2019re designing the system. Again, we\u2019re super proud of, I think, our ad business. I think the size of the business would be impressive as a standalone company. But at the same time, we have to make sure the sequencing is right, where we are always making sure that we have the most engaged, the largest audience when it comes to local commerce. That will make it easy for everything else from an ad perspective.\nMark Zgutowicz: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s Q&A session and today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Ravi Inukonda",
            "content": "So, Nikhil, just to add a couple of points to what Tony talked about, right? The demand on the platform continues to be very strong. When we look at the underlying cohorts, they're very strong. The recent cohorts are actually as strong as any of the older cohorts that we've seen. Even for the core restaurant business, when I look at the growth rate in GOV on a year-over-year basis, the growth in Q2 is very consistent with what we saw in Q1. Even from a linearity perspective, the business actually grew faster in June compared to April. Tony talked about some of this, but DashPass had a really strong quarter, all-time high in terms of subscribers, order frequency continues to be at an all-time high. So, the underlying cohort strength is actually very strong and the demand continues to be very strong across the Board for us. Hey, Ross. I'll take the first one. Tony, feel free to jump in on the second one. But in take rate perspective, Ross, let me break out what's going on with revenue. If you think about revenue, there's a few different components. You have the ad business, which is growing really fast. You have a platform business, which is also growing really fast. Both of those are driving the improvement you're seeing in both revenue growth as well as take rate. At the same time, you also have cost lines, whether it's Dasher or quality. The team has done a great job of improving that compared to last year, boosting improvements in efficiency. For us, the goal has always been to continue to drive improvements from an efficiency perspective. But at the same time, we're also going to continue to find opportunities to reinvest that back in growth. As I look ahead from a take rate perspective, I do expect us to improve and grow our ad business, as well as our platform business. Even on the cost line, there's still lot of opportunity for us to continue to drive improvements in efficiency. At the same time, we're going to try to find good opportunities where we can drive investments in retention or the frequency while continuing to improve the overall take rate in the business. Hey, Mike. It's Ravi. Just to add a couple of points that Tony talked about on the international side. Again, the formula for us, like Tony mentioned, is largely similar. We're seeing strength in retention. We're seeing strength in order frequency, as well as gross profit. Last call, I talked about the fact that the entire international portfolio is gross profit positive and it has continued to improve. For us, what's important is we want to drive scale. Scale drives efficiency in the business. We've done that in the U.S. and it's the same formula we're using in the international market as well. Yeah. Andrew, I'll take the second one. Maybe just a couple of points on the first one that Tony mentioned. Our goal is to drive overall order frequency up. We're not trying to drive just the restaurant order frequency up or the new verticals order frequency up. In fact, looking at the order frequency in a blended basis is not how we think about the business. It's truly a cohorted business. When I look at the cohorts, even the age cohorts, they're engaging better with us. Their order frequency is going up, partly because the product has gotten better. You have more categories. Delivery times have gotten better. The entire order frequency continues to go up. The newer cohorts are actually joining at better order frequency than many of the older cohorts. Andrew, second point on selection investment. I mean, look, I mean, our goal is to continue to drive selection higher. It's a core part of our strategy. We are adding selection in restaurants. We are definitely adding more selection on the grocery side, as well as international. The way we think about it is, as long as we are driving incremental GOV, as long as the conversion is continuing to increase, we're going to continue to drive selection higher. And you're seeing that strength being reflected in not just the demand, but the underlying cohorts of the business as well. Yeah. Let me take the first one and I'll get into the second one. On the EBITDA upside that we saw in Q2, there's two factors, right? One, you saw us continue to drive higher growth. GOV came in better than expectations. The overall business is gross profit positive, so you're seeing that flow through to the bottomline. Two, you also have improvements in unit economics, gross profit across most major lines of business. You're seeing that impact the overall business as well. From a philosophy perspective, Brad, I mean, I think, I want to be clear. Our goal is to grow as fast as we can by being inside of the range from an EBITDA perspective. I would expect that to be the case going forward in Q3 as well. But longer term, let me break the business apart, right? On the restaurant side, we've done a great job of improving the contribution margin in H1 despite absorbing some of the regulatory costs. There's still a lot of opportunity for us to continue to drive margin higher there. It's not going to be at the same clip as we've done over the last couple of years. New verticals, as well as international are still early. We're seeing good growth. We're seeing good opportunities to continue to invest there. But these businesses are not truly optimized for efficiency. As we continue to drive efficiency higher across the P&L, I would expect margins to continue to improve. More importantly for us, the formula has always been invest behind retention, order frequency, as well as continued improvement in gross profit. We have seen that in the business. If we find good areas to continue to drive investment, we're going to do that. Our goal is to drive GOV growth while being disciplined from an overall investment perspective. Hey, Mike. I'll take the first one. Tony will take the second one on regulatory. On the first one, I mean, look, I mean, inflation has not had a big impact on our business. If you think about it, like when inflation first peaked about a year ago, we saw fewer items per order. But overall, we've also driven consumer fees down. So I look at overall, even the restaurant business from an AOV perspective, it's relatively flat year on year. So we're not seeing any impact on that. And pretty pleased with the progress we've made on overall affordability, which is continuing to drive the growth that you're seeing in the business. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe on New York and Seattle. I talked about the fact in the last call that we did take a meaningful amount of impact on EBITDA from the regulatory cost in Q1. That did come down in Q2, just like I said it would. A lot of that is being driven by the underlying improvements we've made in product to drive efficiency higher. I do expect those costs to continue to reduce as we go through the rest of the year. Look, I mean, our goal in philosophy has always been any market that we operate in, want to run with sustainable unit economics, and that's going to be true for these markets as well. It's not going to be a step function change. It's going to be a gradual change. We really like what we're seeing in the business from an overall efficiency improvement perspective for those markets. And Ron, just to add to that, the way we think about investing is, our goal is to grow as fast as we can while trying to be within the discipline parameters. What you're seeing in the business is restaurant growth has been very strong. We're continuing to drive margins there higher. You're seeing very similar dynamic in both new verticals, as well as international. But not just the growth, but overall improvement in profitability has been higher. For us, whenever we think about a dollar of efficiency, the next step we think about is that back in the business, because you want to drive order rates higher, you want to drive scale higher. The scale ultimately drives efficiency. And that's the consistent cycle that we've been on and nothing has changed in regards to how we operate the business. Hey, Lee. I'll take the one on OpEx. Tony will take the second one. Look, I mean, our goal is not just to grow strongly in 2024, but our goal is to continue to drive strong growth for many years to come. For us, the key there is continue to innovate on the product side. What we're seeing in the business is continue to invest behind the product. You're seeing improvements in retention. You're seeing improvements in order frequency. I mentioned earlier, the 2023 and the 2024 cohorts are as strong as any of the older cohorts we've seen. Our philosophy has always been to invest behind the strength that we're seeing in the business. We are investing, we're adding resources in select areas, mostly on the engineering and the product side. And I think the benefits of that from an overall growth, as well as an efficiency perspective. As I think about OpEx, I would expect OpEx roughly to be at the same level on a percentage of GOV basis for the rest of the year. I mean, looking forward, our goal is to continue to scale the business and our goal is to drive leverage in OpEx, just like any other part of the P&L. Hey, Shweta. It's Ravi. Just to add to... John, on New York and Seattle, from an overall GOV perspective, I mean, the combination of both of those markets don't make up a large portion from an overall company perspective. So the impact from GOV and volume from an overall company perspective has been small. Individual markets we're seeing some elasticity, but not to impact the overall total company growth rate. From an EBITDA perspective, I mean, look, Q1, I mentioned that we did take a meaningful amount of impact on EBITDA from these costs. That cost did come down in Q2. A lot of that is being driven by improvements we've made on the product on the efficiency side. As we go through the rest of the year, I do expect the cost impact from an EBITDA perspective to go down. This was part of the reasoning I mentioned, causing H3 to be higher than H1, where we're seeing impact from regulatory costs continue to reduce, as well as the volume continues to grow, as well as the gross profit for the various lines of business continue to grow as we go through the rest of the year."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Hey, Nikhil. It's Tony. I'll take both of those and feel free to chime in, Ravi. We're seeing really strong demand on the consumer side. So, we're not actually seeing some of the challenges that you may be hearing about or reading about in other headlines. I think there are a few reasons for this. I think, first, we're still in the early innings of the move towards digital and the overall omnichannel experiences that every restaurant and retailer is participating in and we're lucky to play in the part that is growing. I mean, if you look at digital only, that's growing not just for us at DoorDash on our marketplace, it's also growing for us in our first-party platform as we power a lot of these restaurant and retailer websites for ordering, as well as their delivery channels. And they see that too, by the way. While some restaurants, to your point, may be seeing some headwinds in traffic, I mean, their digital channels are growing very robustly, many multiples of, I think, their overall growth and we see that similarly. But at the same time, we're still just single-digit penetration in restaurants and outside of restaurants. We're even lower than that. So, we see a long runway for growth there. The second point I make is that our product continues to get better. I mean, if you looked at our cohort behavior, whether it's retention or order frequency, I mean, all of these things are as good or better than even our pandemic cohorts for every cohort since the pandemic. And so, I think that's a reflection and testament to the work that the team is doing. We already have category-leading selection, but we're continuing to extend that lead. We have the best quality as well as lowest cost logistics network in the most places in the U.S., not just for restaurants, but also for retail. That continues to get more accurate and faster. We continue to work on our affordability programs. I mean, DashPass had an all-time high in terms of its subscriber base. So, I think a lot of people are resonating across all of the dimensions in which we are judged from the consumer's view. The final point I make is that, we are increasing the number of use cases on DoorDash. We continue to see just tremendous growth, much faster than the industry, I mean, many, many, many fold faster than anyone else, both in the U.S. as well as globally in restaurants, but also outside of restaurants. And increasingly, we're seeing customers come to us for the first time actually for non-restaurant use cases. And so, in terms of your question on new customers, I mean, we actually see a couple of things. One, we still acquire more than anyone else. I mean, more than -- in restaurants, more than one out of every two new customers that come into the industry. Outside of restaurants, we're about one in every two. So, in any category of local commerce, we acquire more new customers than anyone else. And I think what you see about the point about like, \u201cHey, look, is the new customer point saturating?\u201d The way I think about this is for us at DoorDash, yes, we have tens of millions of customers every single month, but we have many multiples of that ordering with us every single year. So, within even our own ecosystem, whether they're a new customer or a customer that's an occasional customer that's coming back now to the platform, within our own ecosystem, we have a long runway for growth. And so, yes, we're getting new customers, especially in restaurants and new categories. I mean, I mentioned some of those stats, but we're also getting customers who are in our ecosystem. They don't participate yet with us every single month or every single day, but increasingly, they're getting this. And Ross, on the second question about international markets and just the retention and frequency levels there. I mean, it's really a story of two things. One is, well, we started with a very robust set of fundamentals and foundation, right? I mean, this really was the key investment thesis behind teaming up with Wolt. I mean, when we were looking internationally in terms of expansion opportunities, one of the things, perhaps, the top thing that got us most excited about teaming up with Wolt was the fact that they had leading retention and frequency in every market that they competed in. And that's a combination of a few things. But at the end of the day, it comes down to offering the best combination of inputs for customers, the best selection, the best quality of service in terms of delivery quality, the best affordability, and the best support. The second thing I would say is that, since teaming up with Wolt, which closed in 2021, it's been a couple of years now. We've added some of the lessons that we've learned at DoorDash, lessons in making improvements to each one of these inputs. And that combination, I think, is what you see that's driving the growth and virtually taking share gains in every market that we play in. Sure. Yeah. I mean, on the first question regarding international and just lessons learned. I mean, the first thing I would say that -- is that, there's no silver bullet in operating these kinds of businesses, but the story is really the same in virtually every market. Sure, every market, to your point, has different challenges and different dynamics in the market, but at the end of the day, it comes down to who can create the best service for customers, couriers and merchants. And I think remembering that as simple as it sounds is actually quite important, because I think there's always a lot of competitive activities in our space, but I think that making sure that you can win on building the best product as measured by the highest retention and frequency levels. I mean, that's kind of what we've always held ourselves to. That's what the customer holds us to. And I think that we've been lucky in that we've been able to achieve that bar at least better than anyone else in all the markets that we plan. But at the same time, it's also not good enough, if you look at just how underpenetrated so many of these markets are, especially outside of the United States. And that's true in the restaurants category, but that's true virtually in every category, which just means that we've got a long ways to go before we're satisfied with what we've done for our customers in solving the local commerce opportunity. With respect to CPG, I think, it's been just a really fast learning curve for us. I think we had a lot of attention and excitement from virtually every top CPG advertiser, because they saw the largest local commerce platform offering ads for the first time three years ago that had the highest frequency, the highest membership base for local commerce and the highest cross-sell between categories. And so, obviously, their question is like, \u201cHey, what are you waiting for? When are you guys going to actually open up the platform, so that we can meet new customers?\u201d At the same time, we also have to balance the other side, which is an advertising business can only be built off the back of a healthy and robust marketplace business, and it doesn't really go the other way around. You need the marketplace business to grow in order for your advertising business to have a long runway for healthy growth. And so that's kind of what we've always looked for, but it's always two guiding principles. How do we offer the best-in-class consumer experience with no degradation in experience, and how do we offer the best return for advertisers? And that's true for small restaurants, that's true for big restaurants, that's true for big CPGs, that's true for small mid-market CPGs. I think that, one thing that you see now that we're in the third year of doing this is we're starting to finally make great progress in just offering a very balanced portfolio. I think we started by offering and introducing ads to restaurants where I think that was, something that was very natural to some of the activities that we had done before then. But now that's pretty much fully built out for CPGs and I think now it's making sure that we grow that in a responsible way, achieving, again, the balance between consumer happiness and advertiser returns. I can take the first part of the question. I mean - Andrew, I guess, in general, I mean, we see order frequency increases both within restaurants and incrementally on top of that from new verticals. It depends a lot on the geography and which new selection that has been onboarded or so how strong the selection density is within a market. For example, obviously, we've been very strong in grocery and in convenience. That's been a big focus for us for years. And we're excited, actually, just this morning, we announced an update to our partnership with Chase, which now makes us Chase's exclusive partner in both restaurant delivery and grocery delivery for all of their cardholders. And so, I think you're seeing the appreciation of our performance, not just by consumers, but also by other large companies out there that are trying to tap into a very valuable base of customers, a lot of whom are coming to us for grocery and for these new verticals. But there are examples where we just launched recently, for example, with Ulta Beauty. So as we've launched health and beauty, some customers come to us for the first time, whether it's to Ulta, to Sephora, to other health and beauty merchants for the first time, or Lowe's in the home improvement category. So, it's not coming from one area. As we add more categories, we see more order frequency growth. Yeah. Hey, Bernie. I mean, I guess, to add to some of the comments I made previously, we have a good foundation to build from in all of our markets. That's how we start. And if you don't have that, it's difficult to solve every local commerce problem. For us, that obviously starts with the restaurant business, which, whether it's internationally or here in the U.S., we have leading retention and frequency, which is a great place to build upon. And we've added quite a lot of categories into all of our markets actually and those are growing really, really nicely. But when I look outside of the U.S., I would say that, the vast majority, virtually every country outside the U.S. for us, is still behind what we think the penetration levels ought to be if we actually brought all of the products that we have in market here in the U.S. overseas. We're not there yet, right? We have a great house in which the structure is very, very good. We're growing many folds faster than our peers. We're doing a nice job of launching new products that we've built from the DoorDash side to all of our markets. But on the flip side, I would say that, the levels there are still not where they ought to be. We've got a long ways to go on getting restaurant selection where it needs to be. We're off to a fantastic start outside of restaurants, especially given that retail, I would say, is a little less developed on a comparative basis when you look outside of the U.S. versus, say, the retail industry within the U.S. And then when I look at the five businesses that we have, as well as other businesses that we're incubating, I think, the potential to bring this globally to be the largest local commerce platform in any country, I think, that remains just a very, very large opportunity for many years of growth. Yeah. The second question with respect to regulatory, it's actually pretty much the same story that I think we've communicated ever since doing the first earnings call. And really, it reflects even what we thought 10 years ago when we started forecasting what might be true in regulatory, in particular on the labor piece across the world, which is I think in the majority of the world, the overwhelming majority, most jurisdictions want to actually support us in giving Dashers what they want, which is the flexibility of a work opportunity that's never existed before and also protections that we believe they deserve. I mean, to your point or the premise of the question, you're right. I mean, it's good to see that lawmakers most recently upheld Prop 22 here in California. We expect that. We expected that not just because we're right on the wall, but because we think it's the right thing to do. It's actually giving users in this case, the Dasher, the driver, exactly what they're looking for. I always have to remind people that over 90% of Dashers do fewer than 10 hours a week on the platform. The average Dasher does 3 hours a week to 4 hours a week. The overwhelming majority, over 80%, 85% of Dashers actually have full-time jobs. So they're specifically telling us, we do not want to be told what hours to work or where to work them. And so we see that most governments, lawmakers around the world, certainly here in the U.S. as well, actually want to do right by the Dasher and actually support us in what we want to do for workers. I also hope whether it's this election cycle or future election cycles, whether it's here in the U.S. or around the world, that things will moderate a bit in terms of temperature and that this can be something that we as a company, as well as other companies in the space can work productively with any government to actually achieve what Dashers want. And I don't know, Ravi, did you want to comment on New York or Seattle or any... ... of these economic activities? Yeah. Go ahead, Ron. Yeah. Hey, Ron. It's Tony. I mean, look, we're always trying to do one thing, right? Which is to move fees in one direction. I don't think I've ever spoken to a consumer who's asked us to raise prices. And so we are always trying to lower the fees and pass them on. And there's various ways in which you can do this. We're obviously trying to be more affordable. We're trying to increase and widen the selection lead that we have. We are trying to improve the quality of our logistics system. We believe we have the best one, but it doesn't mean that it's perfect. And so we have to get more accurate. We have to get faster. We have to be better about finding every product in the physical world, especially now that a lot of what we do is outside of restaurants and inventory remains a challenge for every physical retailer. And so there's a lot of work to do. We're not yet satisfied with where we are on all of the dimensions. We appreciate and tremendously respect all of the efforts that our teams have done in terms of building the best product, in terms of having category leading retention and frequency. We're not there yet. In the eyes of the consumer, we can still be more affordable. We can still have better selection. We can still have better quality and better support. So we're working on all of those things. Hey, Lee. On the second question about the pacing of CPG ad growth, I mean, we really like what we see, right? I mean, right now the focus, again, and it'll always be this, is to make sure that the principle that building a great marketplace comes before building a great ad business. And if your marketplace business isn't growing in a sustainable and healthy way, that's not going to degrade the consumer experience, it almost doesn't matter everything that comes after that sentence. And so, for us, I mean, to your point, you're right. I mean, our new verticals, whether it's grocery, convenience, alcohol, other retail categories, business is growing really fast. Every CPG is a customer and the question is like, how fast do we get into that spend? The way I think about this is, there's no rush to doing it. And actually, you can actually make a pretty big mistake if you get into it too quickly. I mean, as long as we have the biggest audience with the greatest level of activity in terms of frequency engagement, retention and frequency, we're always going to be available to the CPG advertiser. And I think they're always going to be interested and they're always looking for the best returns, and I think it tends to come from the marketplaces that aren't the biggest -- just the biggest, but also the ones with the highest activity and the highest growth rates. And so that's the balance for us. I mean, our CPG ad business is growing really, really fast. I'm very pleased with the performance by the team. But again, in terms of pacing, I almost think of it as sequencing, which is the health of the marketplace should always come before the monetization of the marketplace. Sure. I can take both of those and feel free, Ravi, to add in. Hey, Shweta, on the first question on ad tech stack and just where we are, I mean, it's a three-year-old business. I mean, it's growing lights out fast. I think if it were a standalone business, people would be very pleased with its performance. But again, to me, it's not about rushing it. Even though it's growing really, really fast and we're in no disadvantage relative to anyone else, it doesn't mean that we should just step on the gas all the way. So there's a lot more room. I mean, if you look at where we started with ads, most of the stack was built for restaurants and that probably makes sense given our history. But DoorDash is no longer just a one-category, one-country company. We are five business lines, 30-plus countries. And so to your point, we have to evolve and build maturity in the stack for bigger restaurants, for CPG advertisers, for advertisers across all categories, not just in food, but in all of retail. So I think there's a very long and straightforward roadmap. What I like is that, their -- and certainly what they've told me and also what we see in terms of their investments with us is that they're ready to go. And they're always going to be there so long as we offer the best-in-class returns for them, which we believe derive from having the leading marketplace, both in terms of users as well as usage. And I think the rest will take care of itself. So we feel good about the growth there, but there's a lot more to come. On the second question, I mean, to be candid, we haven't really seen much change in the competitive landscape. I mean, there might be a lot of activity, but there's not a lot of progress, if you know what I'm saying. I mean, I think it's mostly noise that we've kind of heard. And I think that whether you look at new customer acquisition, you look at existing behavior, you still see that, at least in the eyes of the consumer, they seem to really prefer DoorDash. And I think what it speaks to is that you're always going to have a lot of activity. We have seen -- I've been doing this for over 11 years. I've seen periods of very high promotional activities, high partnership activity, high other forms of activity. But at the end of the day, the one thing that any marketplace or any consumer product is judged on is retention and frequency, and that's something you can't cheat. You can't just game on a one-time basis. And all roads always point back to the marketplace that offers the best combination of selection, quality, price, and support. So far, we are -- that marketplace, as long as we can continue our extension of our lead in the product. I feel really strong about our position, irrespective of activity. But I think it's always been competitive. I expect it to always be competitive. But in terms of, like, what's actually happening, whether it's in suburban markets, urban markets, nothing's really changed. Hey, John. It's Tony. I'll take the first one on adding selection and maybe, Ravi, you can take the second one. On adding selection, I mean, it's really everywhere, John. I mean, there is no like one category we're particularly targeting. I mean, we are trying to represent every city in a digital way, which means unless we have every breathing merchant that is alive in the city, we don't have great selection. And so that's really true. I mean, if you even were to drive out from any city center, our selection probably wanes as you go further out. And so I think we've got a long ways to go. And don't forget also with restaurants, there's always new restaurants coming in. One interesting fact about the restaurant industry and this is virtually true in every country, is that the total number of restaurants every year almost always exceeds the previous year, but it's not necessarily the same set of restaurants. And that's because restaurants come and go, and so there's always a ton of work to do there. So the room to run on restaurants is almost this perennial kind of body of work. And then with retail, I mean, we're just getting started. And so I think we have a long ways to go in terms of adding selection. Mark, it's Tony. I'll take both of those and feel free to add here, Ravi. Look, on price parity, I mean, you're absolutely right that it's an important point in terms of affordability, right? I mean, we're always trying to make our products and services more affordable. That's true in restaurants, that's true in grocery, that's true in convenience, that's true across the Board. There's no simple or silver bullet answer to your question. I mean, we're constantly working to make sure that we can align the business model and the incentives such that we can offer the most accessible and affordable service. Now, look, all of this comes in conjunction with other things, right? It's not hold -- you can't just hold one thing static. I mean, there's a lot of other things that we have to do in terms of making sure that the inventory is actually there, making sure that if you didn't get what you were hoping to get, that the substitution we made is perfect or acceptable to you. And so there's a lot of things that have to come together for what you're talking about. Price obviously is one component or one input in which we are judged. But there are so many other components too. And they sometimes interplay, right? As we find efficiencies in our logistics work, that's worth it or if we can rip out inefficiencies that shouldn't be in our system, those are costs that we can use to help fund other programs. And so there's a lot going on. There's no simple answer to your question. But it's something that will be a perennial part of what we do. On the second question, I mean, it's a great question, which is that you're absolutely right that, ads do have an impact, a negative impact on the consumer experience. And it's why I kind of harp on this all the time where you have to not be confused in terms of what drives what. And in this case, it's a healthy marketplace that enables an ad business and not the other way around. And so this is one thing in which I think we've been more conservative on in making sure that we protect the consumer experience. And so, in terms of seeing degradation, we haven't seen much of it, partly because of how we're designing the system. Again, we're super proud of, I think, our ad business. I think the size of the business would be impressive as a standalone company. But at the same time, we have to make sure the sequencing is right, where we are always making sure that we have the most engaged, the largest audience when it comes to local commerce. That will make it easy for everything else from an ad perspective."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DoorDash Q1 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to turn the call over to Andy Hargreaves. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Hargreaves: Thanks, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our Q1 2024 earnings call. I'm very pleased to be joined today by Co-Founder, Chair and CEO, Tony Xu; and CFO, Ravi Inukonda.\n We'll be making forward-looking statements during today's call, including our expectations for our business, financial position, operating performance, our guidance, strategies, capital allocation approach, and the broader economic environment. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. Many of these uncertainties are described in our SEC filings, including our Forms 10-K and 10-Q. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. \n During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures. Information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, may be found in our earnings release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to our GAAP results and are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. \n As a reminder, we're no longer providing full year financial outlook, and we disclaim any obligation to update our previous full year financial outlook. \n Finally, this call is being audio webcasted on our Investor Relations website, and an audio replay will be available on our website shortly after the call ends. \n Eric, I will pass it back to you, and we can take our first question. \nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. \nNikhil Devnani: Tony, I wanted to ask about your logistics model versus some of the incumbents in the new verticals. As you build out bigger baskets within grocery, other categories of local commerce, it feels like you're competing more directly with the likes of Walmart and Amazon, which has some integrated models and significant fixed cost leverage at scale. So it seems that there's a chance the 3P model might always be at a somewhat disadvantaged on a cost-to-serve basis here and consumers are less paying higher prices for it. \n So would love to just get your perspective on, first, whether you agree with that or not and what levers you kind of have at your disposal to make the model more cost effective over time. Or should we think about your opportunity set as just being a smaller segment of the market that's willing to pay up perhaps for quicker deliveries or a broader selection within the context of a category like grocery, for example? \nTony Xu: Yes. Nikhil, that's a good question. So I guess this is kind of how we've always thought about it. I mean I think, first and foremost, we think about it from the perspective of the customer and how they're going to judge us, right? And if you think about that, well, there are several factors. They're going to judge us based on what selection of retail offerings we give; certainly, the cost of getting fast delivery; as well as the quality of that delivery, both in terms of the timeliness, the accuracy and, especially with regards to something like grocery, whether or not we got exactly all of the items that they had specifically ordered in the condition that they would expect. \n And so if you think about DoorDash's journey or evolution in that process, it started by really introducing a new use case, both to consumers as well as to grocers alike, which was this top-up use case, right, where we solve for the middle-of-the-week run, where the items in your pantry that you consume the most often or the items that perhaps may have perished the earliest, such as fruits or berries or milks or yogurts or coffees, things like this. We really started with that category. And that not only solved a consumer problem that wasn't being addressed in the market at the time, it was also an incremental occasion for retailers. And that's why we're seeing quite a lot of pull. \n We announced a lot of additions to the platform in Q1, whether it was with Ahold as well as more recently in Q2 with Wakefern, and we added several dozen retailers in the quarter. And so I think, certainly, we're seeing increasing pull from consumers and from retailers. And so on the selection front, I think we're making the mark. \n On the logistics question specifically, I think of few things. One, we always thought that we had an advantage given just our Dasher density and the network that we've built up where the thesis would go, if you can build the largest network in the highest frequency category, in the category that has the most nodes for last mile delivery, i.e., there are more restaurants than there are any other category of local retail, then you would have a cost advantage. And that's certainly something that we've seen. I mean, in fact, I think the positive surprise in our grocery business has been that, even with smaller baskets and without a meaningful contribution from CPG ad dollars, we're actually seeing positive unit economics in our new verticals business. And so I think that's certainly proven out. And certainly, there's an advantage of the speed and the flexibility in which we can make this offering to consumers. \n But to your point, there is a trade-off sometimes with cost. Now we believe that we'll make quite a lot of progress in terms of equalizing what we can do versus what else is out there. But there's also this other dimension, right, which is the selection. So on the one hand, third-party is more expensive on a point-to-point basis versus first-party. But then on the other hand, it's faster and it offers more selection. You can certainly get offerings from more stores, for example, than just one single store. \n And so I think it's going to come down to what consumers prefer. We obviously are going to work on a model in which we can increase the amount of selection that we offer, reduce the cost in which that selection is made available, and improve the quality of the process. And I think on these dimensions, we've certainly done that. And I think that's why you see the results that we've outlined where I think it's a third straight quarter now where grocery has seen north of triple-digits growth year-on-year. And so certainly, I think we're seeing that retention and usage and high engagement from consumers. We believe that we're making quite a lot of progress on our fulfillment quality. And we're also making progress on the cost to serve. So all things are pointing in the right direction. So we're pretty excited about where things are headed. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. \nMark Stephen Mahaney: If I could throw in two questions, please. First, on ad revenue, so it looks like you're a little nicely over $100 million run rate, just looking at some of your disclosures in here. Any color on how that's progressing? Are there any areas of strength for you, verticals you want to fill out? Just talk about the traction you're seeing so far. And then just a question, are we close to peak losses when it comes to other verticals and international markets? \nTony Xu: Sure. I can start on the ad question. Ravi, maybe you can take the question on investment capacity. So Mark, on ads, I don't know how maybe you're making the estimates, but our ads business is substantially larger than I think what you were quoting in the question. But I think the broader point on ads is that it's going really well. I think that it started by certainly serving the restaurants category. And we've seen, I mean, extreme adoption from all cohorts, whether it's small businesses to large enterprises. We're now working on building that product both in terms of just more self-serve capabilities as well as serving more reporting capabilities so that everyone can see exactly what's going on with their dollar spend. I think what's been encouraging is that we are offering leading and best-in-class return on ad spend while also seeing good engagement on the consumer front. \n We're also turning our attention to the CPG asset. Obviously, that's something that came after. Our ads effort is about 2.5 years old, something like that. The first 1.5 years was really setting ourselves up for the pull from the market, which probably, not surprisingly, came from the restaurant side. But especially as our grocery and retail sectors have been growing on the marketplace, we're seeing increasing pull from CPG advertisers. And so we do work with all the large CPG advertisers. We're now just building up the products to serve them to meet their demand. \nRavi Inukonda: Yes, Mark, I'll take the second one. But just to what Tony talked about on the first one, right, we've not disclosed the ad revenue, but it is growing. It's growing fast. It's contributing to both revenue as well as EBITDA that you're seeing in the business. Our goal has always been how do we think about merchant ROAS as well as consumer conversion, and we believe we are best-in-class for both of those. Those are the constraints we're using to measure the quality of our ad business. \n Mark, as it comes to your second question around quantum of investment, whether it's new verticals or a national business, when we operate and manage the business, we are not thinking about quantum of dollars. Our focus has always been are we growing order frequency, are we growing retention, are we growing unit economics across any investment that we make, whether it's a restaurant business or grocery or international business. \n Just to give you a sense of performance for our new verticals business, I mean, grocery, Tony touched on this earlier, that business is growing at 100% year-on-year. We're the fastest growing. We're gaining share. Our focus has been to continue to drive more selection, improve the quality as well as make the product more affordable. When I look at the unit economics, last call, I made the comment that the unit economics have increased step-function change compared to last year. We've continued to improve the unit economics from that point. When I look at the third-party component of our new verticals portfolio, that business has been unit economic positive for several years. If you have a business that's growing very fast and the unit economics are continuing to improve, we like what we are seeing and we are continuing to invest behind that strategy. \n Very similar dynamics on the international business where, if I look at the growth rate for our business compared to peers, we're growing substantially faster. In some cases, we're growing 5x to 6x faster, which is causing us to gain share in majority of the markets that we operate. Very similarly, on the unit economics, very good improvement year-on-year where the unit economics for the international business as a whole has been positive for a few quarters now. At the same time, the restaurant portion of our international business, there are several countries which are contribution margin profitable. So you put that together, right, like both the investment areas are growing nicely. They're improving in terms of unit economics. We like what we are seeing in both of those businesses. That's causing us to continue to invest. And I do expect the growth as well as unit economic improvement to continue through the rest of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson. \nMichael Morton: First one maybe for Tony, just to follow on the Q and then a second question for Ravi. Tony, you've spoken a lot about the importance of selection and improving selection in the grocery business and you've added several new grocers recently. We'd love to know if there's any restricting factors in bringing all the nation's grocers onto the platforms. And then what's the time frame for having your selection at parity with the largest competitors? \n And then for Ravi, we get a lot of investor inquiries looking into better understanding where the incremental investment dollars are going, especially with like Dash test for restaurant has hit the scale it has. Is there any way that you could kind of bucket for us or help us think about the different segments of investments within restaurant, new verticals and international, and if you still feel the same level of confidence about the inflection in the second half of '24? \nTony Xu: Sure. I mean I can take the first one. I mean, I think, Michael, I guess, as an add-on or maybe, in part, a repeated message from the first question, we're seeing increasing, I guess, inbound interest on the retail segment. That's true in grocery. That's also true in other retail segment. We added, for example, Lowe's, which is our first retailer in the home improvement category. We're now quite active in terms of what we offer to consumers in the health and beauty category, the apparel category, the electronics category. So I think this goes much beyond grocery, I guess, would be the way I think about this. I mean I think to stop just at grocery would be certainly not what our customers would expect or what they would demand. It's also not what retailers want either. \n And so I think increasingly, retailers and consumers alike are seeing DoorDash as a one-stop shop for buying everything inside the city. So we're actually seeing the opposite of resistance in terms of joining the platform. I think the question is just like how do we prioritize the road map, how do we make sure that the sequencing is right, so that we can get all of these things to work. Because a lot of times how we work with these retailers, it's not just adding them to the marketplace, which obviously serves one job of bringing them incremental demand, but we also work with them by helping them with their own platforms, right, like their own e-commerce capabilities and selling first-party to their own consumers in an increasingly digital way. And there's a lot of products there, too, in which we integrate. And so there's a lot of work in both first-party and third-party. It's more a matter of sequencing than it is anything. \nRavi Inukonda: Yes, Mike, I'll take the second one, right? Maybe I'll broaden out the question a little bit. Look, I mean I feel really good about the progress we've made in the business not just in Q1 but the last several quarters. The business is growing quite nicely across all major lines of business, whether it's restaurant, grocery, new verticals or international. And like I said before in Mark's question, we're seeing improvement in unit economics across the board. \n I do expect the second half EBITDA to be higher than the first half. What's driving that is the same thing that we saw in '23 as well as '22. I expect the volume to be higher in the second half across all lines of business. Unit economics are continuing to progress quite nicely. I do expect further improvement in unit economics. The investments we are making in H1, that will drive both scale as well as leverage in the second half. The scale plus the leverage, that's going to lead to increasing EBITDA in the second half compared to the first half. So overall, when I look at Q1 as well as the Q2 guide, I'm very pleased with the performance, and I expect the full year to be pretty strong as well. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. \nJames Lee: My question is relating to regulations. Obviously, you guys saw a little bit of impact in Seattle and also in New York. How should we think about maybe other cities potentially moving to a similar wage policy? And also, how should we think about the EBITDA impact? You mentioned 1% impact on orders. I'm just wondering what is the impact on EBITDA? \nTony Xu: Sure. Maybe I can take the first part. And then, Ravi, you can take the part around the financial impact. I mean I think it's pretty clear in both Seattle and New York City, as maybe you have read, James, in our press release that I mean these regulations clearly are having the opposite impact of what they intend to do, right? I think they certainly support to help drive earnings. But instead, what's happening is it's making the service a lot less accessible and a lot less affordable, right? It's increasing costs, which makes it such that consumers have to pay more. \n Merchants are making less as a result, and drivers are getting fewer work opportunities. I mean that's what you see in both Seattle and New York, I mean to the effect where I think Dashers, merchants and consumers in Seattle are lobbying their lawmakers and regulators and elected officials to overturn the regulation. So I think that's the unfortunate part of what's actually happening, which is it's literally having the opposite impact. Although this probably could have been predicted as I think we've been telling lawmakers and regulators alike. \n But I think to the broader question that you're asking, this is kind of what we've been saying since, I guess, going public, and honestly, what we predicted even 10 years ago when we started the company, that most governments and lawmakers want to be productive, participants in working with businesses to provide a service that serves to existing cities. I mean why wouldn't you? I mean, think about the billions of dollars or tens of billions of dollars that you're adding to the local economic GDP or the fact that you're offering a service that consumers love and a place where anyone can really earn extra income on their own time. I mean, who wouldn't want that? And so I think most governments think like that, and that's true across the world, not just here in the U.S. \n But there are a handful of cities, you listed a couple of them, where they're antagonists to this perspective. And in some ways, they would prefer the opposite of creating positive GDP inside their cities. But I think that's still limited to the handful of cities, on one hand, that we've kind of forecasted both 10 years ago when we started the company as well as what we've been saying ever since going public. \nRavi Inukonda: Yes, James, on the second point, right, we're not disclosing the exact EBITDA impact from both New York and Seattle in Q1. That said, we did absorb a meaningful amount of cost in the quarter. Look, I mean, our approach to regulatory market has not changed, right? First and foremost, our priority is to ensure that we're making the business more efficient, which we did in Q1. We did pass on some fees to consumers. I do expect that every market that we operate in, over time, will have sustainable unit economics. I do expect us to reduce the cost that we are taking in Q1 to go down over the course of the rest of the year. It's not going to be a step-function change. It will be gradual over time. But we expect both markets to be sustainable from a unit economic perspective going forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Nowak: Maybe let me go back to that last comment you just made about market therein, you're looking to have sustainable unit economics. Can you help us understand a little bit more on the international side? You have all these countries that you're investing in, in the international side. I know a lot of times, scale is important to driving durable profitability in food delivery. Competitive dynamics are an advantage. Just walk us through, like how should we think about sort of the different countries and how you're managing the international portfolio just to make sure that all the markets that you're in can actually get to profitability over time? \nTony Xu: Yes. Brian, I can start. And feel free, Ravi to chime in. I mean we're very pleased with our international portfolio. I mean now it's about 29 countries outside of the U.S. So to your point, it's certainly an expanding portfolio, which makes it more complex to manage. But at the same time, the business is a minimum efficient scale business where in each ZIP code or a collection of ZIP codes or locale, if you can achieve minimum efficient scale, every order that comes after that point kind of becomes dollars that you can use to eat up all the investments that you've made in the market. So we feel pretty good about where things are heading. \n I mean we are continuing to expand. I mean I think that's really the story of international right now in the sense that we're not even in the geographies that we are in, in 100% or even close to 100% of the population. And so we have a long ways to go in terms of getting to the cities that we want to reach. We certainly have a long ways to go in adding merchant selection in restaurants, outside of restaurants. We have a lot of work to do to bring the product portfolio that we've kind of built over the years equally or evenly across every country. But we like what we see, right? \n I mean like if you think back to the investment thesis we had when we teamed up with Wolt, for example, which certainly added very quickly our international portfolio, it was really just two things, right? One was, if we were to team up with the product and the company that had built the leading product when it came to retention, order frequency; and number two, that we can find the best operating team to be singularly focused on running the international business, that, that would be the most capital-efficient way to grow outside of the U.S. And certainly, both of those dimensions have been true. I mean I think on the business side, I think Ravi may have mentioned this, but we're growing many times faster than our peers, and that's been sustained over the last 2 to 3 years, and that continues to be the case. \n And then on the second point around the management team, Miki and the team have done a phenomenal job of running, obviously, the Wolt portfolio but then also adding on countries in the DoorDash portfolio outside of the U.S. And so they've done a really good job across all of those dimensions, which frees up management bandwidth to focus on, obviously, the core U.S. restaurants business but then also adding other legs of growth, whether it's the platform business, the new verticals business, the ads business and, obviously, other initiatives we're investing in for the future. So I think all of that is teaming up really nicely. \n You've also had this nice cross-team learning dynamic where we're certainly introducing things to the Wolt team and those markets for the first time, which is adding both top and bottom line impact, and conversely, the other direction. So I think when I look at how things are going internationally, they're going pretty well. \nRavi Inukonda: Yes. Look, I mean, Brian, I'll just add a couple of points to what Tony talked about. What we're managing the business towards each and every individual market, it's retention, order frequency and unit economics. When I look at the dashboard where we look at this by city, we have done a major improvement across all 3 metrics. We've seen a material progress on all 3 metrics over the course of the last couple of years. \n And the proof is in the pudding, right? Like I talked about the fact that there are several countries within the Wolt portfolio as well as our international portfolio but the core restaurant business is actually contribution margin profitable. And the unit economics across the international portfolio is actually profitable for the last several quarters in a row. As we continue to add more selection, as we continue to make the product more affordable, we are starting to see that response, right? Like MAUs are growing at a double-digit rate. Order frequency continues to be at an all-the-time high. This is what gives us confidence that the business is doing really well as well as we are gaining share compared to peers. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. \nEric Sheridan: Maybe one big picture one, if I can. When you think about the SKU of an incremental investment dollar in the business, how do you measure where the better dollar might be spent between either end-demand generation and driving further GOV growth and penetration in new verticals compared to $1 of investment in platform innovation, product innovation and how that maybe sets the platform up over the medium to long term? Would love to get some broader thoughts on evolution of that SKU and relative ROI? \nTony Xu: Sure. Eric, I mean, I can maybe start. I guess, in some ways, it hasn't changed in the sense that it almost always starts with what new products are we going to build to solve problems for customers better, right? The difference is that the surface area in which we apply that thinking has grown pretty tremendously. Obviously, 4 years ago or 4.5 years ago, it was really applied towards one kind of line of thinking, the U.S. restaurants business, which was upsized, but it was still just more of a singular business unit. \n But then when I think about kind of the legs of the stool today, you obviously have the U.S. restaurant business, which has been severalfold bigger. But then you kind of have like 3 more that we've added that are now at scale. You have the platform business, the new verticals business, the international business. And then you kind of have a small thing that's just getting started, it's like I think 2.5 years old, which is the ads business. \n But it's still the same idea where we found that the most capital-efficient way to think about the next dollar invested tends to be what product can we build to solve some problem better. Either it's the same problem, but we're solving it better and finding basically the next level of product market fit for the next cohort of customers who obviously have higher expectations than the previous cohort or it's solving a problem for the first time. When we entered, for example, the grocery segment 3.5 years ago, where that was meeting customers for the first time in that category. And so that's in general kind of how we think about it. \n And then there's like other types of capital allocation decisions, right? When you start thinking about whether it's M&A or possible buybacks and things like this, but those tend to be slightly different computations and calculations. But with respect to like generally how we've done things, it tends to be how do you spend the incremental dollar by best solving the next job to be done for the customer. \nRavi Inukonda: Yes. Maybe Eric, I'll just add to what Tony talked about. For us, our business ultimately depends on making the product better for our consumers, merchants and Dashers. So when we think about where to invest dollars, the first dollar is always going to go to making the product better. And it's adding selection, whether it's improving the quality or continuing to meet the product more affordable. \n We are very scientific. We're very disciplined when it comes to measuring ROI. We obviously look at all aspects of that. We measure that both on a short term as well as a long-term basis. But sometimes, we just had ambitious goals and give the teams the flexibility to continue to innovate, with the goal being if we build the best product, consumers are going to come back. They're going to order more with us, which builds scale. And ultimately, that drives long-term free cash flow generation in the business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. \nAndrew Boone: Tony, can you talk about the drivers of the platform services acceleration that you've seen over the last year? \nTony Xu: Sure. I mean I think there's been many things there. But I would say it's really probably like two thematic things where, one, we're continuing to offer fulfillment services through DoorDash Drive, which is the first product we launched as part of the platform services portfolio, just into more places, right, whether that's more countries, more verticals. I think it's really encouraging to see that every retailer out there, whether they sell food or sell other items, recognizes the importance of delivery and also how that's net beneficial to their companies because the omnichannel customer is more valuable than any other customer who shops exclusively in one channel. \n And second, it's really just new products, right? We're always building new things. If you think about what platform services or division of the business is, it's to effectively enable any retailer to do what DoorDash does on its marketplace for their own customers, right? And so that goes much beyond fulfillment. You're going to have to do everything from online ordering, all the way to customer support, right? And there's a lot of activities in between that you kind of have to get right. So the second is just always building new products. \n So I think this is a nice example of, I think, the answer to the previous question around capital allocation, which is how do we make sure that we solve this job and how big is that job for the customer, how much is it worth, and solve it as deeply as we can and then move on to the next job, right? But that's really what we've seen in platform services. And it's just really great to see, I think, for every retailer, a physical retailer, that's just increasingly becoming more and more aggressive in investing in digital. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. \nRonald Josey: I wanted to, maybe, Tony, take it back to take rates and sort of where we stand. I think in the press release, you talked about reduced average delivery time, defect rates, net consumer fees per order lower. So I was curious if you could talk just about the contributions of these changes or these improvements to overall take rates. And on the scale of, call it, where we are in the continuum of how things are going, sort of how much more is there that can just improve? And I'm sure the answer is infinite, but when we think about defect rates coming down, I think that was a pretty material impact on take rates. So any insights there would be helpful, just on delivery time, defect rates, just overall efficiencies. \n And as a follow-up to Andrew's question on platform services, just curious, we've been highlighting it for the past couple of quarters, would love to hear just are we seeing more adoption amongst restaurants today versus a few years ago? \nTony Xu: Sure. I can take both of them. I think the first question was around just how do we see like, I guess, benefits to the consumer product improving over time. And I mean, look, this is one of those things where it's really a game of inches, and then you're just following the laws of compound interest, which tend to get underestimated, right? And so you're totally right. I mean, like consumers demand improvements across the board. They always want lower prices, faster deliveries, higher accuracy, more selection, better customer support. That is always going to be true. \n And I think the thing that just, at least for me, been a lesson learned over almost now 11 years, but over 10 years of doing this, is that we always underestimate, I think, how far these things can go. And I think that's kind of just fighting human nature, right? I mean because I think human nature wants to know that there's some marginal return that becomes a concave function. And I think what ends up happening is you get surprised either by the next technology platform or you just get surprised by how compounding works. And so that's at least been my experience so far. And so we're always going to keep pushing the envelope. And so far, we keep seeing more ways to make improvements to the product, in part because that's what customers expect. And that's actually why I've always believed that customer expectations have always been, candidly, the most difficult form of competition. \n I think your second question was around platforms and are restaurants may be adopting more now than before. I think it's a few things. So I think when it comes to adopting products that help retailers, physical retailers, become more digital, it's one of the things where it's a journey and sometimes the journey takes nonlinear steps, if that makes any sense. Because if you think about it from the perspective of the merchant, I mean, they have so many years of running a physical business, and it's such a big part of their businesses still today, that they kind of just have to get it right, right? And if that goes wrong, or any shock to that system, then it's a really big impact to the overall company and the people who work there. \n And so sometimes, these things just kind of have like a natural rhythm that may take a little bit longer than you would expect. But I think what's encouraging is just that the appetite is moving in one direction. And so a lot of times, the timing of these kinds of changes, whether it's rolling out new products or doing more with us on fulfillment, or whether it's in restaurants or other categories, that's like maybe less predictable. But what is known is that the direction of travel is always in the direction of greater digital, greater convenience. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bernie McTernan with Needham & Company. \nBernard McTernan: Great. Just wanted to ask, the core U.S. restaurant business decelerated slightly in the quarter on a pro forma or ex leap year basis. What was the major driver of that? I know law of large numbers can be playing a factor here. And if you'd be willing to share if it was still a double-digit grower ex leap year in the first quarter? \nRavi Inukonda: Yes, Bernie, I mean, I'll take this one. I mean I look at the performance of the business in Q1, I mean I was really pleased with the overall progress and performance of the business. I mean the U.S. restaurant business is large at this point. It's growing. It's gained share in the quarter, not just in Q1, but when I look at over the course of the last year. When I look at users and order frequency, both have continued to grow quite nicely. Users, last quarter, we talked about the fact that we have more than 37 million consumers on the platform. That number has continued to grow since that point. The growing users at double-digit rates. Order frequency continues to be at an all-time high. \n When I look at the underlying cohort performance, I mean, it's very strong. DashPass subscribers continue to be at record highs as well. But look, I mean, we've invested to continue to expand the size and scope of the platform and the opportunity in front of us. When you look at new verticals, that business is growing. Grocery, we talked about that business is doubling for 3 straight quarters in a row. International business is growing quite nicely. Our strategy of having multiple categories in multiple countries is going to allow us to really drive strong growth for many years to come. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. \nLee Horowitz: Great. I just wanted to ask on the macro environment a little bit. You've heard from a number of restaurants chains this quarter indicating incrementally weak consumer demand environment, with inflation perhaps being in place higher for longer, finally catching up to the consumer. Can you comment at all maybe what you're seeing in the overall macro environment in terms of overall demand into the restaurant business and how that may be impacting sort of your outlook for the 2Q and the rest of the year? \nTony Xu: Yes, I can take that. I mean, in general, we're not seeing, I think, the signs of strain on the consumer. But I think it perhaps has something to do with the segment that we operate in, which is digital and delivery. I do understand that there are some headwinds that certain merchants face when it comes to in-store traffic. But when it comes to all things digital, we're actually not seeing I think those same signs of strength. I mean, even, for example, in the U.S. restaurants business, I mean, the growth is pretty consistent over the last 6 quarters. So that's, whatever, 18 months or something that, at that roughly has true for. And so we tend to see that to be true there. We even see it true in other categories, even categories like grocery where you're still seeing very sticky or very high inflation in terms of input prices, which has led to high prices on grocery items. But I think on the digital side, we tend to see pretty strong demand. And that's why you see a relatively stable growth. \nRavi Inukonda: Yes. Just to add to that, right, like demand continues to be very strong. You can see that in the cohorts as well. When I look at the 2023 cohorts, they're as strong as any of the other cohorts we've seen. I talked earlier on the previous question, order frequency has continued to set at an all-time record in Q1. And when we look at the newer cohorts, they're actually joining the platform at higher order frequency compared to many of the other cohorts. DashPass also had a very good quarter. Last year, we ended DashPass with over 18 million subscribers. That number has continued to grow. So when I look at the growth across all 3 lines of business, we are really pleased, all 3 lines of business growing double digits, very strong as well as gaining share across the board. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski, Wells Fargo. \nAlec Brondolo: This is Alec Brondolo on for Ken. You noted earlier in the call that the investment that you're going to make in New York City, in Seattle, around the minimum wage was going to decrease through the year. I'm sure there's a consumer fee component of that, but it also sounds like there's probably operational changes that you're making in those markets to improve profitability. So could you maybe speak to those, to the level of specificity, anyway you can? \n And then maybe secondly, I think that thinking about Dasher supply since COVID, it seems like it's been a little cyclical. In '21, when people are getting stimulus checks, Dasher supply was tight and it seems like it's been very favorable over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you maybe just speak to your outlook for Dasher supply? Should it remain healthy over the next year or two? Any potential changes to the supply environment would be helpful, too. \nTony Xu: Sure. I mean I can start maybe on the question. I think in general, when it comes to regulatory, it's honestly just making the best with what you have, right? I mean we know what customers expect. They want the widest selection. They want the lowest prices, the best quality and the best levels of support. So that's what you should expect us to do in any market. And then also at the same time, I think we'll work with regulators to show them, I think, the impact of some of the work that they've contributed. And especially when it's gone opposite of what they hope to achieve, we certainly want to show them those results, too. \nRavi Inukonda: Yes. Just to add to what Tony talked about, on Seattle, New York, you're right, I mean we did absorb costs in Q1. I do expect the amount of cost that we'll absorb to reduce as we go through the rest of the year. That's largely being driven by further improvements in efficiency, whether it's logistics, quality, credits and refunds. We're going to take a look at the entire P&L and see where we are going to continue to drive efficiency, which will ultimately drive improvement in unit economics. And at the same time, our goal is to ensure that all the markets that we operate in have sustainable unit economics. But again, there, it's going to be gradual, but that's the goal for us in general.\n And I think the second point around Dasher supply, supply chain continues to be very healthy. When I look at Dasher costs, we've driven leverage and efficiency despite absorbing some of the regulatory costs on a year-over-year basis. As I look ahead, for us, efficiency largely comes from improvements that we are going to make on the product side. If you look at over the course of the last year, we've made a number of improvements, whether it's redesigning the Dasher app, updating the way Dashers earn on the platform, all of that is driving increase in Dasher attention, which is making Dasher acquisition more efficient. And at the same time, we are seeing more hours from existing Dashers, which is making Dasher Pay also more efficient. We have a long list of improvements that we continue to plan to make, which will make Dasher cost overall more efficient across the board. \nOperator: Your next question from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. \nDouglas Anmuth: Ravi, you talked about higher EBITDA in the back half relative to the first half. I was just hoping you could help us understand what drives the confidence in better unit economics and then the returns on those first half investments. And also, can you just shed a little more light on the step-up in R&D spending in 1Q and how we should think about that through '24? \nRavi Inukonda: Yes. Doug, I'll take the second half question first and then talk about the R&D spend and the outlook for the rest of the year. First, I mean, the formula is relatively simple, what we've used historically. We've seen that in '23 as well as '22. What you see in the business today is the core restaurant business continues to grow quite nicely, double digits, as well as continued improvement in terms of overall profitability. At the same time, you're seeing the growth in new verticals, whether it's grocery or other parts of the portfolio, as well as the international business where we're continuing to improve the unit economics. I mean a third-party component of the new verticals portfolio is unit economic profitable for a few quarters now. Same is true with international where the entire international portfolio is unit economic profitable for a few quarters now. \n We do expect to drive further efficiency, whether it's Dasher cost, a, the regulatory costs where we absorb the cost that's going to continue to reduce over the course of the year. Quality has been a key area of focus for us. Credits and refunds are going to get more efficient. Our ads business is growing. If you combine that with the investments we're making in H1, which will drive not only scale but also leverage, I do expect volume to increase as we go through the rest of the year as well as unit economics to improve as we go through the rest of the year. The combination of both of those is going to have second half EBITDA be higher than the first half. The reason I'm confident is we've done this before. 2023 is exactly the same pattern as well as in '22. And when I'm looking at the business, whether it's Q1 or Q2 guide over the rest of the year, I feel very good about both the top line as well as the bottom line. \n And the second point on R&D., I mean, look, Doug, our goal is not just to drive strong growth in '24, right, but for many years to come. We're fortunate that we are operating in large segments where we still find great opportunities to invest. The key investment we are making is continuing to improve the product. As we improve the product, you're seeing that impact of both retention going up as well as order frequency going up. For us, we are adding head count this year. We're going to be thoughtful. We're adding engineers to help us improve the product. When I look at the rest of the year, I would expect OpEx levels to be similar to what you're seeing in Q1, but longer term, our goal is to continue to drive leverage on OpEx as we continue to grow the business. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ravi Inukonda",
            "content": "Yes, Mark, I'll take the second one. But just to what Tony talked about on the first one, right, we've not disclosed the ad revenue, but it is growing. It's growing fast. It's contributing to both revenue as well as EBITDA that you're seeing in the business. Our goal has always been how do we think about merchant ROAS as well as consumer conversion, and we believe we are best-in-class for both of those. Those are the constraints we're using to measure the quality of our ad business. \n Mark, as it comes to your second question around quantum of investment, whether it's new verticals or a national business, when we operate and manage the business, we are not thinking about quantum of dollars. Our focus has always been are we growing order frequency, are we growing retention, are we growing unit economics across any investment that we make, whether it's a restaurant business or grocery or international business. \n Just to give you a sense of performance for our new verticals business, I mean, grocery, Tony touched on this earlier, that business is growing at 100% year-on-year. We're the fastest growing. We're gaining share. Our focus has been to continue to drive more selection, improve the quality as well as make the product more affordable. When I look at the unit economics, last call, I made the comment that the unit economics have increased step-function change compared to last year. We've continued to improve the unit economics from that point. When I look at the third-party component of our new verticals portfolio, that business has been unit economic positive for several years. If you have a business that's growing very fast and the unit economics are continuing to improve, we like what we are seeing and we are continuing to invest behind that strategy. \n Very similar dynamics on the international business where, if I look at the growth rate for our business compared to peers, we're growing substantially faster. In some cases, we're growing 5x to 6x faster, which is causing us to gain share in majority of the markets that we operate. Very similarly, on the unit economics, very good improvement year-on-year where the unit economics for the international business as a whole has been positive for a few quarters now. At the same time, the restaurant portion of our international business, there are several countries which are contribution margin profitable. So you put that together, right, like both the investment areas are growing nicely. They're improving in terms of unit economics. We like what we are seeing in both of those businesses. That's causing us to continue to invest. And I do expect the growth as well as unit economic improvement to continue through the rest of the year. Yes, Mike, I'll take the second one, right? Maybe I'll broaden out the question a little bit. Look, I mean I feel really good about the progress we've made in the business not just in Q1 but the last several quarters. The business is growing quite nicely across all major lines of business, whether it's restaurant, grocery, new verticals or international. And like I said before in Mark's question, we're seeing improvement in unit economics across the board. \n I do expect the second half EBITDA to be higher than the first half. What's driving that is the same thing that we saw in '23 as well as '22. I expect the volume to be higher in the second half across all lines of business. Unit economics are continuing to progress quite nicely. I do expect further improvement in unit economics. The investments we are making in H1, that will drive both scale as well as leverage in the second half. The scale plus the leverage, that's going to lead to increasing EBITDA in the second half compared to the first half. So overall, when I look at Q1 as well as the Q2 guide, I'm very pleased with the performance, and I expect the full year to be pretty strong as well. Yes, James, on the second point, right, we're not disclosing the exact EBITDA impact from both New York and Seattle in Q1. That said, we did absorb a meaningful amount of cost in the quarter. Look, I mean, our approach to regulatory market has not changed, right? First and foremost, our priority is to ensure that we're making the business more efficient, which we did in Q1. We did pass on some fees to consumers. I do expect that every market that we operate in, over time, will have sustainable unit economics. I do expect us to reduce the cost that we are taking in Q1 to go down over the course of the rest of the year. It's not going to be a step-function change. It will be gradual over time. But we expect both markets to be sustainable from a unit economic perspective going forward. Yes. Look, I mean, Brian, I'll just add a couple of points to what Tony talked about. What we're managing the business towards each and every individual market, it's retention, order frequency and unit economics. When I look at the dashboard where we look at this by city, we have done a major improvement across all 3 metrics. We've seen a material progress on all 3 metrics over the course of the last couple of years. \n And the proof is in the pudding, right? Like I talked about the fact that there are several countries within the Wolt portfolio as well as our international portfolio but the core restaurant business is actually contribution margin profitable. And the unit economics across the international portfolio is actually profitable for the last several quarters in a row. As we continue to add more selection, as we continue to make the product more affordable, we are starting to see that response, right? Like MAUs are growing at a double-digit rate. Order frequency continues to be at an all-the-time high. This is what gives us confidence that the business is doing really well as well as we are gaining share compared to peers. Yes. Maybe Eric, I'll just add to what Tony talked about. For us, our business ultimately depends on making the product better for our consumers, merchants and Dashers. So when we think about where to invest dollars, the first dollar is always going to go to making the product better. And it's adding selection, whether it's improving the quality or continuing to meet the product more affordable. \n We are very scientific. We're very disciplined when it comes to measuring ROI. We obviously look at all aspects of that. We measure that both on a short term as well as a long-term basis. But sometimes, we just had ambitious goals and give the teams the flexibility to continue to innovate, with the goal being if we build the best product, consumers are going to come back. They're going to order more with us, which builds scale. And ultimately, that drives long-term free cash flow generation in the business. Yes, Bernie, I mean, I'll take this one. I mean I look at the performance of the business in Q1, I mean I was really pleased with the overall progress and performance of the business. I mean the U.S. restaurant business is large at this point. It's growing. It's gained share in the quarter, not just in Q1, but when I look at over the course of the last year. When I look at users and order frequency, both have continued to grow quite nicely. Users, last quarter, we talked about the fact that we have more than 37 million consumers on the platform. That number has continued to grow since that point. The growing users at double-digit rates. Order frequency continues to be at an all-time high. \n When I look at the underlying cohort performance, I mean, it's very strong. DashPass subscribers continue to be at record highs as well. But look, I mean, we've invested to continue to expand the size and scope of the platform and the opportunity in front of us. When you look at new verticals, that business is growing. Grocery, we talked about that business is doubling for 3 straight quarters in a row. International business is growing quite nicely. Our strategy of having multiple categories in multiple countries is going to allow us to really drive strong growth for many years to come. Yes. Just to add to that, right, like demand continues to be very strong. You can see that in the cohorts as well. When I look at the 2023 cohorts, they're as strong as any of the other cohorts we've seen. I talked earlier on the previous question, order frequency has continued to set at an all-time record in Q1. And when we look at the newer cohorts, they're actually joining the platform at higher order frequency compared to many of the other cohorts. DashPass also had a very good quarter. Last year, we ended DashPass with over 18 million subscribers. That number has continued to grow. So when I look at the growth across all 3 lines of business, we are really pleased, all 3 lines of business growing double digits, very strong as well as gaining share across the board. Yes. Just to add to what Tony talked about, on Seattle, New York, you're right, I mean we did absorb costs in Q1. I do expect the amount of cost that we'll absorb to reduce as we go through the rest of the year. That's largely being driven by further improvements in efficiency, whether it's logistics, quality, credits and refunds.

And at the same time, our goal is to ensure that all the markets that we operate in have sustainable unit economics. But again, there, it's going to be gradual, but that's the goal for us in general.\n And I think the second point around Dasher supply, supply chain continues to be very healthy. When I look at Dasher costs, we've driven leverage and efficiency despite absorbing some of the regulatory costs on a year-over-year basis. As I look ahead, for us, efficiency largely comes from improvements that we are going to make on the product side. If you look at over the course of the last year, we've made a number of improvements, whether it's redesigning the Dasher app, updating the way Dashers earn on the platform, all of that is driving increase in Dasher attention, which is making Dasher acquisition more efficient.

            "name": "Tony Xu",
            "content": "Yes. Nikhil, that's a good question. So I guess this is kind of how we've always thought about it. I mean I think, first and foremost, we think about it from the perspective of the customer and how they're going to judge us, right? And if you think about that, well, there are several factors. They're going to judge us based on what selection of retail offerings we give; certainly, the cost of getting fast delivery; as well as the quality of that delivery, both in terms of the timeliness, the accuracy and, especially with regards to something like grocery, whether or not we got exactly all of the items that they had specifically ordered in the condition that they would expect. \n And so if you think about DoorDash's journey or evolution in that process, it started by really introducing a new use case, both to consumers as well as to grocers alike, which was this top-up use case, right, where we solve for the middle-of-the-week run, where the items in your pantry that you consume the most often or the items that perhaps may have perished the earliest, such as fruits or berries or milks or yogurts or coffees, things like this. We really started with that category. And that not only solved a consumer problem that wasn't being addressed in the market at the time, it was also an incremental occasion for retailers. And that's why we're seeing quite a lot of pull. \n We announced a lot of additions to the platform in Q1, whether it was with Ahold as well as more recently in Q2 with Wakefern, and we added several dozen retailers in the quarter. And so I think, certainly, we're seeing increasing pull from consumers and from retailers. And so on the selection front, I think we're making the mark. \n On the logistics question specifically, I think of few things. One, we always thought that we had an advantage given just our Dasher density and the network that we've built up where the thesis would go, if you can build the largest network in the highest frequency category, in the category that has the most nodes for last mile delivery, i.e., there are more restaurants than there are any other category of local retail, then you would have a cost advantage. And that's certainly something that we've seen. I mean, in fact, I think the positive surprise in our grocery business has been that, even with smaller baskets and without a meaningful contribution from CPG ad dollars, we're actually seeing positive unit economics in our new verticals business. And so I think that's certainly proven out. And certainly, there's an advantage of the speed and the flexibility in which we can make this offering to consumers. \n But to your point, there is a trade-off sometimes with cost. Now we believe that we'll make quite a lot of progress in terms of equalizing what we can do versus what else is out there. But there's also this other dimension, right, which is the selection. So on the one hand, third-party is more expensive on a point-to-point basis versus first-party. But then on the other hand, it's faster and it offers more selection. You can certainly get offerings from more stores, for example, than just one single store. \n And so I think it's going to come down to what consumers prefer. We obviously are going to work on a model in which we can increase the amount of selection that we offer, reduce the cost in which that selection is made available, and improve the quality of the process. And I think on these dimensions, we've certainly done that. And I think that's why you see the results that we've outlined where I think it's a third straight quarter now where grocery has seen north of triple-digits growth year-on-year. And so certainly, I think we're seeing that retention and usage and high engagement from consumers. We believe that we're making quite a lot of progress on our fulfillment quality. And we're also making progress on the cost to serve. So all things are pointing in the right direction. So we're pretty excited about where things are headed. Sure. I can start on the ad question. Ravi, maybe you can take the question on investment capacity. So Mark, on ads, I don't know how maybe you're making the estimates, but our ads business is substantially larger than I think what you were quoting in the question. But I think the broader point on ads is that it's going really well. I think that it started by certainly serving the restaurants category. And we've seen, I mean, extreme adoption from all cohorts, whether it's small businesses to large enterprises. We're now working on building that product both in terms of just more self-serve capabilities as well as serving more reporting capabilities so that everyone can see exactly what's going on with their dollar spend. I think what's been encouraging is that we are offering leading and best-in-class return on ad spend while also seeing good engagement on the consumer front. \n We're also turning our attention to the CPG asset. Obviously, that's something that came after. Our ads effort is about 2.5 years old, something like that. The first 1.5 years was really setting ourselves up for the pull from the market, which probably, not surprisingly, came from the restaurant side. But especially as our grocery and retail sectors have been growing on the marketplace, we're seeing increasing pull from CPG advertisers. And so we do work with all the large CPG advertisers. We're now just building up the products to serve them to meet their demand. Sure. I mean I can take the first one. I mean, I think, Michael, I guess, as an add-on or maybe, in part, a repeated message from the first question, we're seeing increasing, I guess, inbound interest on the retail segment. That's true in grocery. That's also true in other retail segment. We added, for example, Lowe's, which is our first retailer in the home improvement category. We're now quite active in terms of what we offer to consumers in the health and beauty category, the apparel category, the electronics category. So I think this goes much beyond grocery, I guess, would be the way I think about this. I mean I think to stop just at grocery would be certainly not what our customers would expect or what they would demand. It's also not what retailers want either. \n And so I think increasingly, retailers and consumers alike are seeing DoorDash as a one-stop shop for buying everything inside the city. So we're actually seeing the opposite of resistance in terms of joining the platform. I think the question is just like how do we prioritize the road map, how do we make sure that the sequencing is right, so that we can get all of these things to work. Because a lot of times how we work with these retailers, it's not just adding them to the marketplace, which obviously serves one job of bringing them incremental demand, but we also work with them by helping them with their own platforms, right, like their own e-commerce capabilities and selling first-party to their own consumers in an increasingly digital way. And there's a lot of products there, too, in which we integrate. And so there's a lot of work in both first-party and third-party. It's more a matter of sequencing than it is anything. Sure. Maybe I can take the first part. And then, Ravi, you can take the part around the financial impact. I mean I think it's pretty clear in both Seattle and New York City, as maybe you have read, James, in our press release that I mean these regulations clearly are having the opposite impact of what they intend to do, right? I think they certainly support to help drive earnings. But instead, what's happening is it's making the service a lot less accessible and a lot less affordable, right? It's increasing costs, which makes it such that consumers have to pay more. \n Merchants are making less as a result, and drivers are getting fewer work opportunities. I mean that's what you see in both Seattle and New York, I mean to the effect where I think Dashers, merchants and consumers in Seattle are lobbying their lawmakers and regulators and elected officials to overturn the regulation. So I think that's the unfortunate part of what's actually happening, which is it's literally having the opposite impact. Although this probably could have been predicted as I think we've been telling lawmakers and regulators alike. \n But I think to the broader question that you're asking, this is kind of what we've been saying since, I guess, going public, and honestly, what we predicted even 10 years ago when we started the company, that most governments and lawmakers want to be productive, participants in working with businesses to provide a service that serves to existing cities. I mean why wouldn't you? I mean, think about the billions of dollars or tens of billions of dollars that you're adding to the local economic GDP or the fact that you're offering a service that consumers love and a place where anyone can really earn extra income on their own time. I mean, who wouldn't want that? And so I think most governments think like that, and that's true across the world, not just here in the U.S. \n But there are a handful of cities, you listed a couple of them, where they're antagonists to this perspective. And in some ways, they would prefer the opposite of creating positive GDP inside their cities. But I think that's still limited to the handful of cities, on one hand, that we've kind of forecasted both 10 years ago when we started the company as well as what we've been saying ever since going public. Yes. Brian, I can start. And feel free, Ravi to chime in. I mean we're very pleased with our international portfolio. I mean now it's about 29 countries outside of the U.S. So to your point, it's certainly an expanding portfolio, which makes it more complex to manage. But at the same time, the business is a minimum efficient scale business where in each ZIP code or a collection of ZIP codes or locale, if you can achieve minimum efficient scale, every order that comes after that point kind of becomes dollars that you can use to eat up all the investments that you've made in the market. So we feel pretty good about where things are heading. \n I mean we are continuing to expand. I mean I think that's really the story of international right now in the sense that we're not even in the geographies that we are in, in 100% or even close to 100% of the population. And so we have a long ways to go in terms of getting to the cities that we want to reach. We certainly have a long ways to go in adding merchant selection in restaurants, outside of restaurants. We have a lot of work to do to bring the product portfolio that we've kind of built over the years equally or evenly across every country. But we like what we see, right? \n I mean like if you think back to the investment thesis we had when we teamed up with Wolt, for example, which certainly added very quickly our international portfolio, it was really just two things, right? One was, if we were to team up with the product and the company that had built the leading product when it came to retention, order frequency; and number two, that we can find the best operating team to be singularly focused on running the international business, that, that would be the most capital-efficient way to grow outside of the U.S. And certainly, both of those dimensions have been true. I mean I think on the business side, I think Ravi may have mentioned this, but we're growing many times faster than our peers, and that's been sustained over the last 2 to 3 years, and that continues to be the case. \n And then on the second point around the management team, Miki and the team have done a phenomenal job of running, obviously, the Wolt portfolio but then also adding on countries in the DoorDash portfolio outside of the U.S. And so they've done a really good job across all of those dimensions, which frees up management bandwidth to focus on, obviously, the core U.S. restaurants business but then also adding other legs of growth, whether it's the platform business, the new verticals business, the ads business and, obviously, other initiatives we're investing in for the future. So I think all of that is teaming up really nicely. \n You've also had this nice cross-team learning dynamic where we're certainly introducing things to the Wolt team and those markets for the first time, which is adding both top and bottom line impact, and conversely, the other direction. So I think when I look at how things are going internationally, they're going pretty well. Sure. Eric, I mean, I can maybe start. I guess, in some ways, it hasn't changed in the sense that it almost always starts with what new products are we going to build to solve problems for customers better, right? The difference is that the surface area in which we apply that thinking has grown pretty tremendously. Obviously, 4 years ago or 4.5 years ago, it was really applied towards one kind of line of thinking, the U.S. restaurants business, which was upsized, but it was still just more of a singular business unit. \n But then when I think about kind of the legs of the stool today, you obviously have the U.S. restaurant business, which has been severalfold bigger. But then you kind of have like 3 more that we've added that are now at scale. You have the platform business, the new verticals business, the international business. And then you kind of have a small thing that's just getting started, it's like I think 2.5 years old, which is the ads business. \n But it's still the same idea where we found that the most capital-efficient way to think about the next dollar invested tends to be what product can we build to solve some problem better. Either it's the same problem, but we're solving it better and finding basically the next level of product market fit for the next cohort of customers who obviously have higher expectations than the previous cohort or it's solving a problem for the first time. When we entered, for example, the grocery segment 3.5 years ago, where that was meeting customers for the first time in that category. And so that's in general kind of how we think about it. \n And then there's like other types of capital allocation decisions, right? When you start thinking about whether it's M&A or possible buybacks and things like this, but those tend to be slightly different computations and calculations. But with respect to like generally how we've done things, it tends to be how do you spend the incremental dollar by best solving the next job to be done for the customer. Sure. I mean I think there's been many things there. But I would say it's really probably like two thematic things where, one, we're continuing to offer fulfillment services through DoorDash Drive, which is the first product we launched as part of the platform services portfolio, just into more places, right, whether that's more countries, more verticals. I think it's really encouraging to see that every retailer out there, whether they sell food or sell other items, recognizes the importance of delivery and also how that's net beneficial to their companies because the omnichannel customer is more valuable than any other customer who shops exclusively in one channel. \n And second, it's really just new products, right? We're always building new things. If you think about what platform services or division of the business is, it's to effectively enable any retailer to do what DoorDash does on its marketplace for their own customers, right? And so that goes much beyond fulfillment. You're going to have to do everything from online ordering, all the way to customer support, right? And there's a lot of activities in between that you kind of have to get right. So the second is just always building new products. \n So I think this is a nice example of, I think, the answer to the previous question around capital allocation, which is how do we make sure that we solve this job and how big is that job for the customer, how much is it worth, and solve it as deeply as we can and then move on to the next job, right? But that's really what we've seen in platform services. And it's just really great to see, I think, for every retailer, a physical retailer, that's just increasingly becoming more and more aggressive in investing in digital. Sure. I can take both of them. I think the first question was around just how do we see like, I guess, benefits to the consumer product improving over time. And I mean, look, this is one of those things where it's really a game of inches, and then you're just following the laws of compound interest, which tend to get underestimated, right? And so you're totally right. I mean, like consumers demand improvements across the board. They always want lower prices, faster deliveries, higher accuracy, more selection, better customer support. That is always going to be true. \n And I think the thing that just, at least for me, been a lesson learned over almost now 11 years, but over 10 years of doing this, is that we always underestimate, I think, how far these things can go. And I think that's kind of just fighting human nature, right? I mean because I think human nature wants to know that there's some marginal return that becomes a concave function. And I think what ends up happening is you get surprised either by the next technology platform or you just get surprised by how compounding works. And so that's at least been my experience so far. And so we're always going to keep pushing the envelope. And so far, we keep seeing more ways to make improvements to the product, in part because that's what customers expect. And that's actually why I've always believed that customer expectations have always been, candidly, the most difficult form of competition. \n I think your second question was around platforms and are restaurants may be adopting more now than before. I think it's a few things. So I think when it comes to adopting products that help retailers, physical retailers, become more digital, it's one of the things where it's a journey and sometimes the journey takes nonlinear steps, if that makes any sense. Because if you think about it from the perspective of the merchant, I mean, they have so many years of running a physical business, and it's such a big part of their businesses still today, that they kind of just have to get it right, right? And if that goes wrong, or any shock to that system, then it's a really big impact to the overall company and the people who work there. \n And so sometimes, these things just kind of have like a natural rhythm that may take a little bit longer than you would expect. But I think what's encouraging is just that the appetite is moving in one direction. And so a lot of times, the timing of these kinds of changes, whether it's rolling out new products or doing more with us on fulfillment, or whether it's in restaurants or other categories, that's like maybe less predictable. But what is known is that the direction of travel is always in the direction of greater digital, greater convenience. Yes, I can take that. I mean, in general, we're not seeing, I think, the signs of strain on the consumer. But I think it perhaps has something to do with the segment that we operate in, which is digital and delivery. I do understand that there are some headwinds that certain merchants face when it comes to in-store traffic. But when it comes to all things digital, we're actually not seeing I think those same signs of strength. I mean, even, for example, in the U.S. restaurants business, I mean, the growth is pretty consistent over the last 6 quarters. So that's, whatever, 18 months or something that, at that roughly has true for. And so we tend to see that to be true there. We even see it true in other categories, even categories like grocery where you're still seeing very sticky or very high inflation in terms of input prices, which has led to high prices on grocery items. But I think on the digital side, we tend to see pretty strong demand. And that's why you see a relatively stable growth. Sure. I mean I can start maybe on the question. I think in general, when it comes to regulatory, it's honestly just making the best with what you have, right? I mean we know what customers expect. They want the widest selection. They want the lowest prices, the best quality and the best levels of support. So that's what you should expect us to do in any market. And then also at the same time, I think we'll work with regulators to show them, I think, the impact of some of the work that they've contributed. And especially when it's gone opposite of what they hope to achieve, we certainly want to show them those results, too."
